Britain is facing its most severe ever terrorist threat and fresh attacks in the country are inevitable, according to the head of Britain�셲 normally secretive domestic intelligence service in a rare public speech.
Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, said the UK had seen �쏿 dramatic upshift in the threat�� from Islamist terrorism this year, reflecting attacks that have taken place in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge.
The spy chief said: �쏷hat threat is multi-dimensional, evolving rapidly and operating at a scale and pace we�셶e not seen before.��
He added: �쏧t�셲 at the highest tempo I have seen in my 34-year career. Today there is more terrorist activity, coming at us more quickly, and it can be harder to detect.��
MI5 is under pressure to demonstrate its effectiveness after four Islamist terrorist attacks escaped its detection this year.
Parker�셲 speech to specialist security journalists on Tuesday was his chance to frame the debate about Britain�셲 battle against Islamist terrorism at a time when the agency�셲 staff numbers are already expanding from 4,000 to 5,000.
This month the government will receive reports on whether chances to thwart the atrocities were missed and what lessons could be learned. Ministers and the National Security Council wanted independent oversight of the review, in essence not allowing MI5 or counter-terrorism police to assess themselves. Oversight is being provided by the barrister David Anderson QC, a former government appointment as independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.
Parker said MI5 had stopped far more terror plots than those that caused mass casualties this year. He said 20 plots had been thwarted in the last four years.
Seven plots had been stopped before jihadists could strike in the last seven months alone, Parker added. �쏷he threat is more diverse than I�셶e ever known. Plots developed here in the UK, but plots directed from overseas as well. Plots online. Complex scheming and also crude stabbings; lengthy planning but also spontaneous attacks. Extremists of all ages, gender and backgrounds, united only by the toxic ideology of violent victory that drives them.��
He also defended the decisions made by his staff about which suspects posed the most danger to the public. �쏷hey get up and come to work every single day to make terrorist attacks less likely and to keep the country safe. They are constantly making tough professional judgments based on fragments of intelligence; pinpricks of light against a dark and shifting canvas. That is the job of MI5.��
The flurry of Islamist attacks this year claimed 36 lives. As well as the atrocities at Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge a bomb was left on a tube train at Parsons Green, west London, but failed to fully explode. On top of that was the Finsbury Park attack, which is blamed on an extreme rightwing motivation.
Parker added that military defeat in Syria and Iraq for Islamic State did not mean its threat would wane. �쏮eanwhile, Daesh [Isis] itself is under military pressure and is rapidly losing ground in its heartland in Syria and Iraq. So much so that it�셲 now advising would-be fighters to choose other countries �� At the same time the Daesh brand has taken root in some other countries where areas of low governance give it space to grow.��
He said 100 Britons were believed to have died fighting for Isis and fresh danger was posed by the potential return of 850 more who had travelled to its territory, although a large influx had not yet materialised.
Asked if a future attack in the UK was inevitable, Parker said: �쏧 think we have to be careful that we don�셳 find ourselves being held to some sort of perfect standard of 100% because that just isn�셳 achievable.�� He said it was likely attacks would occur.
The formal terrorism threat level remains at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. Twice this year it has been raised to its maximum level, meaning an attack could be imminent, after the Manchester and Parsons Green attacks. In both cases there were fears among officials that suspects or bomb related materials could be at large.
Amid concerns that Brexit could damage security cooperation, Parker said working with European partners remained crucial to MI5�셲 mission. �쏻e share intelligence. We run joint operations. Every single day.��
The spy chief was careful in his tone towards technology companies such as Google, Facebook and YouTube which have been accused of not doing enough to help thwart criminals and terrorists using their technologies.
Parker said that as technology advances, social media companies have an �쐃thical responsibility�� to do more to help suppress terrorism. He warned that �쏿n unintended side-effect is that these advances also aid the terrorists, whether it�셲 the ease of online purchasing, social media content or encrypted communications. No company wants to provide terrorists with explosive precursors.
�쏶ocial media platforms don�셳 want to host bomb making videos. And communications providers don�셳 want to provide the means of terrorist planning, beyond the sight of MI5.��
At 5.03pm on Friday, I received a WhatsApp message from my elder son to tell me he was just by Oxford Circus, that he thought there had been a terrorist incident, and that he wanted to know if I had heard anything. My blood ran cold.
By coincidence, I too was in the West End, hunched over my laptop before a meeting. So I took off immediately towards the shop where he had found refuge, running down Oxford Street towards the police cordons, against a tide of people hurrying anxiously in the opposite direction.
The air turned blue as I bumped into a few of them, wondering why the crazy guy with the beard was racing against the current towards whatever had (or hadn�셳) happened. Please understand, there wasn�셳 a shred of courage in my mad dash: just the primal instinct of parenthood.
By the time I reached my son, the mood of collective panic was already melting into something closer to jumpy confusion. Helicopters buzzed overhead. Sirens wailed. Hundreds more spilled out on to the streets as the locked-down shops opened their doors. The traffic crawled grumpily around the northern fringes of Soho. Fear eased혻smoothly into humour.
Though 16 people were hurt in the crush, one suffering a nasty leg injury, there were no fatalities, no mutilated bodies on the pavement (as there were after the Westminster Bridge attack) or nails in the faces of children (one of the many horrors of the Manchester Arena bombing). The police and emergency services responded impeccably. There is혻much to be grateful for.
But what actually happened just after 4.30pm on Friday? Two men, aged 21 and 40, have handed themselves over to police after an apparent altercation at Oxford Circus tube station. This confrontation, it is now reported, escalated into full-blown panic as the rumour mill whirred into action, turbocharged in real time by social media. MailOnline had to apologise for circulating a tweet claiming that a lorry had mounted the pavement on Oxford Street with �쐏olice all around it and blood on the floor��. The tweet was not only incorrect but 10 days old.
Convergence technology has, of course, given us the smartphone as the defining device of our era �� transforming what Mark Earls, in his masterly book Herd, calls �쐔he physics of mass behaviour��. In his analysis of phenomena such as the responses to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Sydney riots of 2005, Earls shows that most of what we do is �쐔he result of the influence of other people, because we are a super-social species��. Much of what we think is product of individual purpose is in fact driven by emulation.
The underexplored question is whether, and in what circumstances, that emulation is reasonable. Here�셲 what I know: my 16-year-old, who is not inclined to embellishment, heard what sounded like gunshots. A backfiring car? A beam crashing into a skip at a nearby construction site? Possibly. But he also observed dozens of people fleeing Oxford Circus in mortal fear. I would still like to be told what he, and they, heard. Did the two-man �쏿ltercation�� involve the discharge of weapons? The police said they had found no �쐃vidence of shots fired��, which is not quite the same as saying that none were.
I even felt a batsqueak of sympathy for Olly Murs, who was pilloried online for tweeting from Selfridges to his 7.8 million followers an experience hundreds of others were going through. �쏳eally not sure what�셲 happened!�� the singer posted at 5.07pm. A little later he tweeted: �쏝eing told no shots in Selfridges!��
Some would say �� some have �� that a public figure in such a situation has a혻solemn duty to stay silent online until혻the police have made a statement. This strikes me as both unrealistic and unfair. Imagine the opprobrium that would have been heaped on Murs if the혻commotion he observed had indeed혻been triggered by a terrorist atrocity, and he had not used his digital혻clout to alert those in the area.
The events of Friday had혻much less to do with the follies of social media, or a fretful pop singer, or the fragility of the contemporary psyche, than the cold, harsh reality of 2017. To date this year, 36 people have died and hundreds more been injured in four terrorist attacks on British soil. In October Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, told the Guardian 20 plots had been thwarted in the last four years, and that there had been �쏿 dramatic upshift in the threat�� from fundamentalist terrorism.
There is a morally shoddy yearning to avert our eyes from this simple fact and to focus instead on secondary issues: on immigration, on the ethics of giving terrorists the �쐎xygen of publicity��, on Islamophobia, on Tony Blair�셲 alleged culpability for just about everything, on the failure of Twitter to provide as accurate a news service as the BBC. On anything, in fact, rather than the truth that there has been a change in what it means to live in a British city, and accordingly in the way in which we respond collectively to danger �� real, imagined, or somewhere in between. We oscillate between stoicism and fear. We remind ourselves of past attacks �� the blitz, the IRA �� and console ourselves that we endured and shall do so again. I like to think we will.
But it does nobody any favours to deny that the British urban experience today hums with a new sense of dread easily ignited into street mayhem by the slightest spark. There are good reasons why this is so, and we ignore them at our peril. It is a melancholy fact of modern life that, just occasionally, panic혻is the rational option.
October�셲 truck attack in Manhattan was the latest major terrorist attack on US soil that has been carried out by those who have claimed inspiration from Islamist terror groups like al-Qaida or Isis. It is the latest attack of its kind since the 11 September attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 that left nearly 3,000 people dead and prompted president George W Bush to launch military action against al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Here is a timeline of other major terror attacks in the US:
Hesham Muhammad Hadayet, an Egyptian national with a green card giving him permanent status in the United States, killed two people and wounded four at an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport. Hadayet also died. The FBI later concluded that it was an act of terrorism but that Hadayet was acting alone.
In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, an American-born convert to Islam, opened fire on an army recruiting office in Little Rock, Arkansas. Muhammad killed one soldier and wounded another. Muhammad, who previously lived in Yemen, claimed to be a member of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. His lawyers produced an expert who testified that he was delusional and Muhammad eventually pled guilty to avoid the death penalty.
Army major Nidal Hasan opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, Texas. The American-born Hasan killed 13 fellow soldiers and wounded 32. Hasan was also paralyzed in the attack. At his trial, he declared himself to be at war with America and investigators found that although he acted alone, he had accessed jihadist websites. Hasan was sentenced to death and is currently incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
The Boston Marathon bombing attack was carried out by two brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The bomb placed at the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and injured 264. The two later killed Sean Collins, an MIT police officer. In addition, in a firefight between the brothers and the police, 16 officers were injured and another later died. Tamerlan, the older brother, died after he was shot by police and his brother ran over him in a car in an attempt to escape. Dzhokhar was apprehended and sentenced to death in federal court. The two Kyrgyz-American immigrants had been self-radicalized but learned to make their bomb from the al-Qaida online magazine Inspire.
Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez attacked both a marine recruiting office and US Navy reserve center. Abdulazeez first opened fire on the recruiting office from a car, wounding a recruiter inside. He then drove to a Navy reserve center where he killed four marines and one seaman before police officers killed him. Abdulazeez was an American citizen born in Kuwait. Former FBI director James Comey later said Abdulazeez was �쐌otivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda.��
A married couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tasheen Malik, opened fire on a Christmas party at the San Bernandino County Department of Public Health, where Farook worked. Fourteen people died and 24 were injured. Farook was born in the United States and Malik was a Pakistani immigrant who married Farook in Saudi Arabia after they met on the internet. The two were later killed in a shootout with police. The FBI later described the two as �쐆omegrown violent extremists�� and found that they had radicalized before they met online.
American-born Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In calls made during his rampage at the gay nightclub, Mateen pledged allegiance to Isis. After his initial assault, the attack into a hostage situation that lasted for nearly three hours. Eventually police stormed the nightclub and killed Mateen in a shootout. Barack Obama later said that Mateen was �쐇nspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the internet��.
A man drove a rented pickup truck into cyclists and runners on the Hudson River bike path on Manhattan�셲 lower west side, killing eight people and injuring 11. Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old immigrant from Uzbekistan, has been charged with murder. On 28 November 2017, he pleaded not guilty. The next hearing in Saipov�셲 case is set for 23 January.
Amateur footage appears to show the man suspected of killing at least eight people in a truck attack running through the streets of Manhattan brandishing what looks like a firearm as gunshots ring out

Egypt�셲 president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, cultivates a hard-man image. His response to Friday�셲 atrocity at al-Rawdah mosque in northern Sinai was wholly predictable. Hours after Islamic State-linked gunmen killed more than 300 Sufi worshippers, Sisi sent waves of warplanes to exact revenge. �쏷he air force has �� eliminated a number of outposts used by terrorist elements,�� the military said.
If only it were that easy. If Sisi and his generals knew the location of such terrorist outposts, why had they not already been destroyed? It is probable the targets were chosen randomly and yet more innocent lives may now have been lost. This, in turn, may exacerbate Egypt�셲 long-running problem with Islamist insurgents.
Speaking to the nation after the mosque attack, Sisi �� a former general who seized power in 2013 in a military-backed coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government �� reverted to the only language he knows. �쏷he police and military will avenge our martyrs and restore peace and security,�� he said. �쏻e will respond with brute force.��
But like an alcoholic who takes a drink and hopes that somehow the outcome will be different this time, Sisi�셲 addiction to violence is a kind of madness. Egyptian leaders before him, notably Hosni Mubarak, all tried to physically crush their opponents. They all failed. And Sisi will, too.
In the 1990s, before al-Qaida and Isis fully emerged, Islamist extremists tried to weaken Mubarak�셲 autocratic regime by targeting security forces, the Coptic Christian minority, and western tourists in Luxor. The official response, notably in underdeveloped Upper Egypt, was mass arrests, shoot-to-kill orders, torture and a scorched earth policy.
�쏷hose actions destroyed the livelihoods of farmers and their families, who then became prey for recruitment by the very groups the government was trying to defeat,�� says Mona Eltahawy, a Reuters correspondent in Cairo at the time.
More recently, the largely ungoverned spaces of northern Sinai province have become a new locus of militant activity. Sinai has been under a state of emergency, and closed to outside agencies and media, since 2014, when militants killed 30 Egyptian soldiers. In 2015, a Russian passenger jet carrying 224 tourists and crew from Sharm el-Sheikh was shot down.
Friday�셲 atrocity, like the airliner attack, has been blamed on Wilayat Sinai, an Islamist group with links to Isis that has previously hit Coptic churches in Cairo and Alexandria, although no claim of responsibility has yet been reported.
Sisi�셲 �쐇ron fist�� tactics have proved futile. The Isis connection appears to be strengthening as the terror group�셲 �쐁aliphate�� in Iraq and Syria is degraded. Isis is reportedly regrouping in neighbouring Libya. Northern Sinai may also become a destination of choice for displaced jihadis.
Unlike al-Qaida, which generally eschews civilian targets, Wilayat appears bent on maximum mayhem. By murdering Muslims, albeit Sufi Muslims who zealots view as apostates, the group has issued a challenge to Egyptian society as a whole.
Such lethal recklessness could eventually prove Wilayat and Isis�셲 undoing, by alienating ordinary Egyptians and people in similarly impacted Arab countries. But Sisi�셲 unthinking return violence could have the opposite effect, leading to further unchecked escalation.
Long experience shows that more killings, repression and dictatorial rule are not the answer for Egypt, any more than for other post-Arab Spring countries. Egypt under Sisi has become a black hole for human rights and democratic governance. Yet the US and Britain turn a blind eye, while a bloodthirsty Donald Trump tweets demands for revenge.
Until the state rejects systemic violence as a form of policy, the violence of non-state actors will persist and grow. That�셲 a hard lesson for a hard man like Sisi.
Counter-terrorism officials believe they have foiled another plot to attack the UK with two men arrested by armed police and investigations continuing on Wednesday.
The arrests, described as �쐓ignificant��, took place on Tuesday afternoon, the first in north London and the second in Birmingham. The alleged plot is believed to have been inspired by Islamic State propaganda and one of the more serious seen this year, investigators believe.
Counter-terrorism officials believe the UK has seen nine plots foiled since March 2017, before Tuesday�셲 arrests, and 21 foiled since 2013. The threat of attack is at its worst ever level, believes the MI5 director general, Andrew Parker.
The disrupted plots come on top of the five attacks since March 2017 which escaped detection leading to four atrocities in London and Manchester, and an attack on a London train failing to cause any fatalities because the bomb failed to detonate properly.
Police chiefs assessed that armed officers were needed to make the arrests, which were the result of a decision by counter-terrorism police and MI5, the domestic security agency, after a joint operation.
The two men, aged 21 and 20, were arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorism contrary to section 40 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
They are in custody and being questioned, and searches are under way in London and Birmingham.
Police gave few details about the arrests, which were made by officers from the Metropolitan police�셲 counter-terrorism command, firearms officers and the counter-terrorism unit covering the West Midlands.
The Met said: �쏷he officers arrested a 20-year-old man in north London and a 21-year-old man in south-east Birmingham at approximately 14.50hrs and 16.30hrs respectively on Tuesday 28 November.
�쏝oth are being detained in custody under the Terrorism Act at a south-east London police station. Searches at addresses in south-east Birmingham and north London are ongoing.��
Police and MI5 say they have disrupted a series of attack plots this year. Five attacks were not detected, four linked to violent Islamism and one to extreme rightwing ideology.Recent terror attacks in the UK have affected domestic family tourism but failed to deter international visitors, as 2017 saw record tourist levels, industry bosses said.
Central London attractions saw a fall in numbers of around 17% on average between May and the second week of September compared with 2016, according to Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva).
During that time there were four terror attacks in the UK, three of which happened in the capital, killing more than 30 people.
Donoghue said young families were the largest group of those avoiding the capital�셲 zone one. �쏷hese are parents under 35 with kids aged around seven. They have reacted significantly to the attacks,�� he said.
�쏝ecause they weren�셳 brought up in the shadow of the UK and the IRA this is their first experience of domestic terror, while some of us who are older may take it in our stride and keep calm and carry on.
�쏝ut they are going elsewhere, places like Bath, Bristol, Oxford, instead.��
But 2017 has been a record year to date for visitors to the UK in general and London in particular, with growth set to continue for 2018, he added.
There were 30.2 million visits to the UK from overseas in the first nine months of the year, up 7% on the same period in 2016, and are projected to reach 39.9 million by the end of the year, the latest VisitBritain figures show.
Visitor numbers from the US jumped by around 14% thanks to �쐔he way British emergency services dealt with the attacks, a lack of hysterical press reporting, and the draw of the weak pound��, Donoghue said.
He added that Alva research showed the public found safety barriers, bollards and bag searches at popular spots �쐒eally reassuring�� in a way they would not have done five years ago.
Tom Jenkins, chief executive of the European Tourism Association (Etoa), said the public were rationalising the spate of attacks, realising they could happen anywhere.
He said: �쏷he nature of free and open societies is people are vulnerable at any stage. It�셲 perfectly easy for anyone to grab an axe and start swinging.
�쏷error used to be a major and sensational disruption to the travel industry. In the 1980s and early 1990s we saw mass cancellations, a real failure of nerve on an epic scale.��
Around half of holiday reservations from North America to Europe in 1986 were cancelled following America�셲 bombing of Libya, with travellers fearing reprisal attacks, he noted.
Jenkins added: �쏶ince then we�셶e seen a gradual reduction in public concern, and a concomitant raising of government concern, with administrations engaging in ostentatious closing of doors in the aftermath of attacks.
�쏳egarding the bollards springing up, it�셲 all part of the decoration that reminds us terrorism works insofar as it conducts government spending and policy.
�쏷he threat posed is almost certainly minimal, and fear would stop everyday life if we let it.��
A couple have been found guilty of plotting a Christmas bomb or chemical attack in the UK.
Munir Mohammed volunteered for a �쐋one wolf�� mission as he chatted on Facebook with a man he believed was an Islamic State commander. He enlisted the help of Rowaida El-Hassan, a pharmacist he had met through a dating website, drawing on her knowledge of chemicals needed to make a bomb.
At the time of his arrest in December 2016, Mohammed had two of the three components to make a lethal explosive as well as bomb-making manuals, mobile phone detonators and ricin poison.
Mohammed, 36, of Derby, and El-Hassan, 33, of north-west London, denied preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016, but a jury found them guilty following a trial at the Old Bailey.
The judge, Michael Topolski QC, remanded the pair in custody and said they faced jail when they are sentenced on 22 February.
The prosecution claimed Mohammed was drawn to El-Hassan, a University College London graduate, on SingleMuslim.com because she referred in her profile to having a master�셲 in pharmacy.
She wrote that she was �쐋ooking for a simple, very simple, honest and straightforward man who fears Allah�� whom she could �쐖ibe with on a spiritual and intellectual level��.
Jurors were told the pair had a �쐒apidly formed emotional attachment and a shared ideology��. By the spring of 2016 they were in regular contact on WhatsApp and had met more than once in a London park near El-Hassan�셲 home. As well as arguments, jokes and everyday concerns, they also shared extremist views and videos.
Anne Whyte QC, prosecuting, said Mohammed �쐒esolved upon a lone wolf attack�� and El-Hassan was well aware of his plan.
In August 2016 Mohammed was put in touch via Facebook with a man he believed was an Isis commander known as Abubakr Kurdi. He pledged allegiance to Kurdi and offered to participate in �쏿 new job in the UK��, said to mean an act of terrorism, jurors heard.
The following month Mohammed complained he had not received his instructions, saying in coded language: �쏧f possible send how we make dough [explosives] for Syrian bread [a bomb] and other types of food.��
El-Hassan advised fellow divorcee Mohammed on what chemicals to buy for a bomb, jurors were told.
In November Mohammed got hold of a video containing information on how to manufacture ricin, the court heard.
In the days before his arrest, Mohammed was captured on CCTV in an Asda store buying nail polish remover in the mistaken belief it contained a chemical component of the explosive TATP. He also looked at pressure cookers at Ace Discounts, which the prosecution said could be used to contain the explosives.
When police raided his home on 12 December 2016, they found hydrogen peroxide in a wardrobe and hydrochloric acid in the freezer. Mohammed denied the chemicals were for a bomb, claiming the hydrochloric acid was to clean the alloys on his car and the peroxide was to treat a burn.
El-Hassan, who came to Britain from Sudan at the age of three, told jurors she had sulphuric acid for her drains and had face masks to wear while she dealt with a damp problem in her flat.
Asked whether she had feelings for Mohammed, she said: �쏧t was mixed feelings at the time. Yes, there was emotional attachment.��
Mohammed, a Sudanese national, arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry and claimed asylum in February 2014, the court heard.
After waiting for more than two years, he appealed to the Derby MP Margaret Beckett for help with his immigration problems. The Labour MP was informed by authorities that his case was not straightforward and had been referred to a specialist unit for consideration.
Nine terrorist attacks have been prevented in the UK in the past year, the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, has told Theresa May�셲 government.
He revealed the information during a presentation to cabinet on the terrorist threat facing the country.
�쏷here have been five attacks that have got through �� four of which are related to Islamist terrorism,�� May�셲 official spokesman told reporters after the briefing.He said the prime minister responded by thanking MI5 for its �쐔ireless work�� in trying to �쐁ombat the unprecedented terrorist threat��.
May�셲 team was also briefed on the changing form of the terrorist threat facing the UK, he said.
�쏞abinet ministers heard that while Daesh [Islamic State] had suffered major defeats in Iraq and Syria this did not mean the threat is over, rather it is spreading to new areas, including trying to encourage attacks in the UK and elsewhere via propaganda on social media.��
He said the home secretary, Amber Rudd, told her colleagues that the pace of attack planning had increased significantly this year, and insisted that ministers were putting pressure on social media companies to remove terrorist material and progress was being made.Rudd highlighted Facebook�셲 claim that 83% of Isis and al-Qaida content posted on its platform was being identified and removed within an hour.�쏶he stressed, however, that there is much more for social media companies still to do,�� the spokesman said.The presentation to the cabinet came as Rudd prepared to make a statement in the House of Commons in response to a report from David Anderson, the government�셲 reviewer of terrorism.Anderson has reviewed the role of the security services in the four terrorist attacks in the UK this year, including those at the Manchester Arena and London Bridge.
Official reviews will clear MI5 and the police of making serious mistakes that allowed terrorists to strike Britain in four attacks this year, the Guardian has learned.
But the reviews will also make a series of recommendations to minimise the chances of missing future attackers, including a new computer algorithm to detect behaviour that could indicate involvement in terrorism.
The internal inquiries were set up in the wake of the atrocities and have been carried out by MI5 and the police themselves, overseen by a barrister.
The reviews have found information was received by MI5 about the Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi, which could have been given a higher priority. But that conclusion is reached with the benefit of hindsight, sources say, and nothing in the reviews demonstrates that clear chances were missed to stop any of the attacks that killed 36 people.
Some may see the notion of MI5 and the police investigating themselves as unsatisfactory; parliament�셲 intelligence and security committee (ISC) has been unable to investigate because the prime minister failed, until last week, to establish it after the May 2017 election.
The ISC will meet on Tuesday and will consider if it should hold its own inquiry into the attacks in London and Manchester.
The report concerns attacks in Westminster, Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park.
The reviews into the four atrocities between March and June where terrorists beat Britain�셲 defences were overseen by a barrister, to provide assurance to the government that the inquiries were thorough.
No individuals are criticised in the reports, and that includes MI5 director-general Andrew Parker. Some media reports had claimed the inquiries into the attack would be so damning that his job might be in jeopardy.
Among a series of recommendations are improvements in:
�� The collaboration between MI5, which leads on counter-terrorism intelligence, and the police, which carries out enforcement action such as the detention of suspects.
�� How closely the two organisations work together.
�� The handling and potentially increased sharing of data with other parties, to put in place better preventive measures.
This is understood to mean better use of data analytics to go through the digital life of current and former suspects, on their smartphones and other devices, for clues indicating they may be more involved in terrorism than previously thought.
Security officials will develop a new algorithm to scour the list of 20,000 former suspects, who are classed as posing little danger, to spot signs they may be re-engaging in terrorism, and then alert intelligence officers.
Those on the list of former suspects currently have little or no resources spent on them.
It is claimed that Khalid Masood, who attacked Westminster in March, Salman Abedi, who bombed Manchester in the May, and Khuram Butt, who attacked London Bridge in June, had previously come to the attention of counter-terrorism officials. The two terrorists who murdered Lee Rigby in 2013 were also in the pool of former �쐓ubjects of interest��. Britain�셲 counter-terrorism system currently actively investigates 3,000 people.
The new algorithm is hoped to lessen the chance anything will be missed. It will inform decisions made by human case officers and analysts, not replace them.
The independent monitoring of the police and MI5 reviews has been carried out by David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation. One security source said his role was to make sure that MI5 and the police counter-terrorism network �쐗ere not marking their own homework��.
Anderson�셲 �쏿ssurance�� role followed a request by the government�셲 National Security Council. He submitted his report to the home secretary on 2 November, and a public version is expected to be released in the last week of this month or in early December.
MI5 and the police counter-terrorism network carried out two internal inquiries. Each organisation carried out a post-attack review to see if errors were made, whether different decisions could have been taken, and how the available intelligence was handled.
The second part looked at how to improve their operations, especially given the view among counter-terrorism officials that the level of attack plotting and supporting activity is at an all-time high, the result of a shift, not a temporary spike.
The ISC is expected to receive both Anderson�셲 public and private report.
While the part of the reviews assessing if counter-terrorism officials made mistakes may attract more attention, the bigger focus among MI5, police and government is on retooling Britain�셲 efforts to cope with an increased threat from potential violent jihadists and a growing extreme rightwing terrorist threat.
Police are trying to reverse a 7% cut in funding they get from the government to catch terrorists, while money has already been earmarked for MI5 to grow its staff by 25% to reach 5,000 people.
Those decisions were made before this year�셲 attacks and before analysts assessed the terrorist threat had reached a new level of seriousness.
The reviews make no demands for controversial new laws or to shift the balance between human rights and security. There are no findings for a return of the stronger control orders which were scrapped by the Conservative-led coalition government and replaced by the terrorism prevention and investigation measures, seen by some in counter-terrorism as weaker and sucking up resources.
Nor are there any findings supporting an extension to pre-charge detention. Sources say police and MI5 accept that the UK already has a strong set of laws after decades first combating Irish republican and then Islamist terrorism.
Police have said they want longer sentences for those involved in terrorist propaganda, amid predictions that Islamic State will increasingly spread its message virtually, as it loses territory.
It is not known if the MI5 and police reviews into the attacks or their recommendations to boost their efforts will be published in any form, though some of their findings may be guessable from the public version of Anderson�셲 report.
The attack at Parsons Green tube station in September is not part of these reviews.
New figures showed investigators have taken 300,000 items of terrorist propaganda off the internet since 2010, but the rate is slowing down, in part because technology companies have stepped up their efforts after years of pleading by the government, law enforcement and security service.
The horrible terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday has so far left us with little useful information regarding the rampage and its perpetrator. But that hasn�셳 stopped either the media or our politicians from indulging in rank speculation and collective guilt mongering.
Here�셲 what we know so far. We know that eight innocent people �� including five from Argentina and one from Belgium �� were tragically killed. We know that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the attack, is a 29-year-old man who came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, before Isis existed. We know that the attacker mowed down his victims using a rented van. And we know that after leaving the vehicle the suspect is reported to have yelled the words �쏛llahu Akbar�� before being shot by a police officer.
As of this writing, that�셲 essentially all we know for certain, at least regarding the key operating details of this attack. And yet, that hasn�셳 stopped the New York Times from reporting that the suspect had been �쐎n the radar�� of the authorities.
But that phrase is so vague that it�셲 worthless, which is precisely the problem. The New York Times report continues by saying that a recent terrorism investigation �쐒esulted in charges against five men from Uzbekistan and one from Kazakhstan of providing material support to Isis. Several of the men have pleaded guilty,�� but then explains that it was �쐕nclear whether Mr. Saipov was connected with that investigation��.
Would the New York Times have reported that in the weeks before Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock killed 59 people, another American man, Spencer Hight, shot and killed eight people in Plano, Texas, and then inform us that it was �쐕nclear�� if Paddock was �쐁onnected with that investigation��? Of course not. But without describing what �쐎n the radar�� means, the Times story fuels groundless speculation and furthers immigrant fear mongering, this time hitting immigrants from Central Asia.
The White House is also pushing a position of collective guilt that will only bode ill for Muslims and foreigners and is completely unlike its reaction from just weeks ago. The Las Vegas shooting prompted the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, to say that since �쐔here is an ongoing law enforcement investigation�� then �쐇t would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don�셳 know all of the facts.��
And yet, here again, a gross double-standard stares us squarely in the face, as Donald Trump exhibits no such restraint when it comes to this attack. �쏧 have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program,�� the president tweeted last night. He is now also targeting the Diversity Visa Lottery, a system established in 1990 with the laudable goal of expanding the pool of immigrants that are admitted into the country.
In their rush to connect this attack to international terrorism, journalists and politicians are missing a key fact. It takes no special training to run people over with a vehicle. You don�셳 need to be a dangerous foreigner to buy fake weapons like a paint gun or a pellet gun. Anyone can shout �쏛llahu Akbar��. It�셲 easy to say you claim allegiance to Isis.
In fact, claiming allegiance to Isis is one way to take whatever violence you want to perpetrate and amplify its effects enormously. Everyone knows that attacks by Muslims, especially foreign-born Muslims, receive drastically more attention than (the more prevalent) attacks carried out by non-Muslims.
One recent study found that terrorist attacks by Muslim perpetrators receive, on average, 449% more media coverage than those by non-Muslim perpetrators, �쐋eading Americans to have an exaggerated sense of that threat��, according to the study�셲 authors.
In American culture today, terrorist attacks by Muslims are still reflexively seen as the expression of a problem shared by all Muslims worldwide, hence the kneejerk demands that Muslims everywhere denounce all attacks by individual Muslims anywhere. Terrorist attacks by white Americans, by contrast, continue to be seen as individual psychological puzzles that are begging to be solved with sympathy and care.
This logic is as dangerous as it is misguided, since it feeds the notion that Muslims, who are nearly a quarter of the world�셲 population, are a unique threat who require their own special set of security measures. To adopt such measures would be to abandon the very principles of equality that our society is supposed to hold dear.
Let�셲 acknowledge that moments like these are when both politicians and extremists find a situation to exploit for their own purposes. For all we know, yesterday�셲 terrorist attack was the sole action of a mentally unstable individual. We can reasonably adjust our policies to meet the situation, but we must first wait for the facts, before we lose our collective mind.
A 27-year-old man was in custody on Monday after allegedly detonating a pipe bomb in a New York City subway station during the morning commute.
The suspect, Akayed Ullah, was one of four people injured in the explosion, which occurred at about 7.20am in a passageway near 42nd Street and 8th Avenue, in midtown Manhattan near Times Square, New York City police said.
None of the injuries were life-threatening. Daniel Nigro, the fire department commissioner, said Ullah sustained burns to his hands and torso while the three other people suffered �쐒inging ears and headaches��.
At a press conference, New York police commissioner James O�셄eill said the suspect had �쏿n improvised low-tech explosive device attached to his body�� with Velcro and zip ties. Law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told the Associated Press the short pipe was packed with explosive powder and was ignited with a Christmas light, matches and a nine-volt battery. But the blast was not powerful enough to turn the pipe into deadly shrapnel.
The New York Times, citing several law enforcement officials, reported that Ullah said he had been radicalized online and had acted in retaliation for US airstrikes in Syria and elsewhere against the Islamic State, or Isis.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said: �쏷his was an attempted terrorist attack.�� He also said there were �쐍o known additional incidents or activities�� but said there would be an increased police presence in the city. The attack is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, said an attack on the subway was �쐖ery frightening and disturbing�� and �쐇n many ways, one of our worst nightmares��.
�쏷his is New York,�� Cuomo said. �쏷he reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom. We have the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. Anyone can go on the internet and download garbage and vileness, how to put together an amateur level explosive device, and that is the reality we live with.
�쏷he counter-reality is that this is New York and we all pitch together, and we are a savvy people and we keep our eyes open �� and we have the best law enforcement in the globe.��
On Monday night, Ullah�셲 family said in statement that it was heartbroken and deeply saddened by the suffering the attack had caused. The statement was released on behalf of the family by Albert Fox Cahn, legal director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in New York.
The statement also said the family was outraged by some of law enforcement�셲 tactics, including pulling a teenage relative from class and questioning him without a parent, guardian or attorney present.
As he had after the last terrorist attack in New York, Donald Trump used the incident to call for tougher immigration measures.
�쏛s I have been saying since I first announced my candidacy for president, America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,�� Trump said, issuing a formal statement rather than using his favored medium of Twitter.
�쏷oday�셲 terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security. My executive action to restrict the entry of certain nationals from eight countries, which the supreme court recently allowed to take effect, is just one step forward in securing our immigration system. Congress must end chain migration.��
The suspect, of Bangladeshi origin, was being treated at Bellevue hospital. Police said there was video of the attempted attack. Asked if the suspect was connected to the Islamic State terror group, O�셄eill said the suspect �쐂id make statements�� but did not elaborate.
Police were investigating Brooklyn properties connected to Ullah or his relatives shortly after the attempted attack. In the quiet residential neighborhood of Kensington, witnesses said they had seen a Swat team enter a six-story building.
The subway station where the blast happened is below Port Authority bus terminal, the busiest in the world, serving at least 65 million passengers each year. On Monday morning, nearby Times Square and its surroundings were overwhelmed by police. The area would usually be packed with commuters and tourists.
The explosion occurred less than two months after a man drove a truck into a bicycle lane on Manhattan�셲 west side, killing eight people. The suspect pleaded not guilty to 22 counts including providing material support to the Islamic State group.
In September 2016, 30 people were injured when a bomb exploded behind a dumpster on West 23rd Street, in the Chelsea neighbourhood. The suspect was found guilty this October, on eight charges.
On Monday, travellers reacted with bemusement, relief and some humor. Danny Nguyen, 24, heard the explosion while he waited for a bus home to Philadelphia. He said police ran into the station. �쏧 saw a mom trying to take her daughter up the elevator the wrong way, just panicking,�� he said.
Tina Grimes, 38, was supposed to be on a bus to Boston. She said she was going to make the best of her extra time in New York. �쏧t�셲 too cold to walk around,�� she said. �쏮aybe I�셪l go shopping or something.��
Barbara Petro had been due to return to Columbia, Maryland. She said the incident would not put her off visiting New York again, but was disappointed because �쐌y granddaughter is singing in a Christmas performance as an angel tonight, and I don�셳 think I�셪l make it��.
The attack interrupted nearly every subway line and some trains were evacuated, putting even more strain on a subway system that has been heavily criticized for long delays and frequent train breakdowns.
Many New Yorkers were unfazed. Shaun Henderson was on the F train after the explosion and said he was just happy the trains were working, even if he was going to be late for work.
�쏧t�셲 the subway, you know,�� Henderson said. �쏯ew Yorkers are used to this. The F train doesn�셳 need a pipe bomb to be fucked up.��
Hours after the explosion, the subway system had almost completely resumed normal service. Though witnesses described panic immediately after the explosion, shortly after the attack the scene was calm.

Canadian police have arrested a Somalian man suspected of stabbing an officer and deliberately ramming pedestrians during a high-speed chase in a rented truck, injuring four in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced as a �쐔errorist attack��.
Authorities in Edmonton confirmed the 30-year-old had applied for asylum and was known to the security services following a complaint in 2015.
�쏷here was insufficient evidence to pursue terrorism charges,�� Marlin Degrand, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at a press conference, adding: �쏷he suspect was not deemed to pose a threat to Canada.��
Police declined to identify the man because he had not yet been charged, saying the pending charges included terrorism and five counts of attempted murder.
The arrest early on Sunday came after an officer was run over outside a football game and attacked with a knife. Hours later, a U-Haul van injured four other people after swerving into pedestrians in a second attack police believe is related.
The recovery of an Islamic State flag from one of the vehicles used in the attacks had led police to pursue the incidents as an act of terrorism.
Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht said officers took a suspect into custody and they think he acted alone. The attack began outside a Canadian Football League game at Commonwealth Stadium on Saturday night. Police said a white Chevrolet Malibu rammed a traffic control barricade and sent an officer flying into the air 15ft.
Knecht said the driver then got out and assaulted the officer with a knife before fleeing on foot. The officer was taken to a hospital and treated for non-life threatening injuries while a manhunt was launched. �쏧t�셲 not critical,�� Knecht said of the injuries.
A few hours later, a U-Haul van was stopped at an impaired driving check stop north of downtown on Wayne Gretzky Drive. Knecht said the name of the driver was close to the name of the registered owner of the car that hit the officer. He said the U-Haul sped off toward downtown with police in pursuit.
Police say the U-Haul intentionally swerved at pedestrians at crosswalks throughout the chase. Four people were injured �� the extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The van eventually flipped near a downtown hotel and a suspect was arrested.
�쏧t is believed at this time that these two incidents are related,�� Knecht said. �쏧t was determined that these incidents are being investigated as acts of terrorism.��
Knecht said Edmonton police wre working with the Royal Canadian Mounted police�셲 national security enforcement team and other Canadian security agencies. Knecht told the public to remain vigilant and observant of their surroundings.
Knecht said police did not call off the chase of the U-Haul due to the seriousness of the crime. Witness Pat Hannigan told reporters he saw police pull the man from the windshield of the toppled U-Haul. He estimated 30 police cars were chasing the U-Haul.
Austin Elgie, manager of the Pint bar just west of the downtown core, also saw the van zoom by with police giving chase. The van �쐏eeled�� into an alley where people were smoking, he said.
�쏧t was crazy,�� he said. �쏧t just came around the corner, ripping. I thought at first he was pulling over for the cops coming by, but he was clearly the one they were chasing.��
Elgie said the van hit a man who was a bar customer.
�쏧 have a registered nurse on my bar team and I grabbed her and had her look after the guy until the ambulance came,�� he said. �쏦e was breathing and we got him in the ambulance and he was still breathing.��
Rachel Notley, the Alberta premier, said on Twitter her thoughts were with the injured officer and she was hoping for a speedy recovery.
It was military appreciation night at the football game between the Edmonton Eskimos and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Canada�셲 chief of defence staff, Gen Jonathan Vance, conducted the pregame coin flip at Commonwealth Stadium and two CF-18 fighter jets did a fly-past before kickoff. More than 800 Boy Scouts were expected at the game and many were planning to camp out on the field afterward.
Eight people have been killed and more than a dozen injured after a man drove a truck nearly a mile down a bike path in lower Manhattan on Tuesday, striking pedestrians, cyclists and a school bus.
New York City�셲 mayor, Bill de Blasio, said the incident was being treated as �쏿 particularly cowardly act of terror��. He said a police officer assigned to the area stopped the attacker by shooting him in the stomach.
After smashing into the school bus, injuring two adults and two children, the 29-year-old suspect exited the truck displaying �쐇mitation firearms��. Witnesses have said the suspect was shouting �쏛llahu Akbar��, Arabic for �쏥od is great��, before he was shot by police, according to the New York police department (NYPD). The suspect was arrested, and a paintball gun and a pellet gun were recovered at the scene.
The suspect underwent surgery and was in critical condition but was expected to survive. Officials who weren�셳 authorised to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity identified the attacker as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek citizen who came to the US legally in 2010. Saipov has a Florida driving licence but may have been living in New Jersey, reports said.
Uber said Saipov was one of its drivers who had passed a background check and had been actively driving for the ride-hailing app for more than six months.
Police said the truck drove south after entering a pedestrian and bicycle path along the Hudson river on the south-west side of Manhattan, where it struck a number of people, coming to a stop near Stuyvesant High school, not far from the One World Trade Center site and Rockefeller Park.
Six men were pronounced dead at the scene on the cycle lane and two other people were dead on arrival at hospital.
�쏧t is a very painful day in our city,�� De Blasio said.
The victims include a Belgian citizen and five Argentinians. The five men from Argentina �� Hern찼n Diego Mendoza, Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro Dami찼n Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hern찼n Ferruchi �� were part of a group of school friends who travelled to New York to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their graduation. Another member of the group, Martin Ludovico Marro, remained in hospital.
The justice department said in a statement that a joint terrorism task force that included the FBI, the NYPD and others was investigating the attack.
There have been multiple �� and conflicting �� reports of a note and/or flag showing support for Isis had been found in the truck used in the attack. The reports have not been officially confirmed.
The New York Times reported that �쐆andwritten notes in Arabic near the truck �� indicated allegiance to the Islamic State��, while CNN said a note was written in English, also indicating support for Isis, and was found inside the truck. Others including the Daily Mail claimed an Isis flag was found in the truck.
A woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, contacted by the Guardian, who identified herself as Dilfuza Iskhakova, said Saipov had stayed at her home for several months about six years ago, after arriving in the US from Uzbekistan. �쏦e seemed like a nice guy, but he didn�셳 talk much,�� said Iskhakova. �쏦e only went to work and came back. He used to work at a warehouse.��
Iskhakova said Saipov had been applying for a green card during this time. Ohio state records show he registered a business involving vehicles to her home in May 2011. Iskhakova said her family lost contact with Saipov in recent years. She said she thought he had moved from Ohio to Florida, and then to the New York region, and that he had a wife and two young daughters.
She said she did not know if Saipov was religious. �쏦e�셲 from my country,�� Iskhakova said. �쏦is father knows my husband, and sent Sayfullo here because he didn�셳 know anyone.��
Officials in New York said additional resources were deployed around the city, where children would be on the streets late into the evening to celebrate Halloween. The city�셲 landmark Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, about six blocks from where the rampage began, continued as usual.
At a news conference, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said these resources were being deployed out of an �쏿bundance of caution�� and that there was no indication of additional threats.
Donald Trump tweeted about the incident: �쏧n NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!��
He added later: �쏻e must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!��
Uzbekistan�셲 president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, issued a statement on Wednesday saying the country �쐇s ready to use all forces and resources to help in the investigation of this act of terror,�� and offered condolences to Trump.
Tom Gay, a school photographer, told the Associated Press he saw a slender man in a blue track suit running southbound on West Street holding a gun. He said there was a heavyset man pursuing him. Gay said he heard five or six shots and the man in the tracksuit fell to the ground, gun still raised in the air. He said a man came over and kicked the gun out of his hand.
Ezequiel Gonzalez, 18, works at the prestigious Stuyvesant high school, which is next to the bicycle path and was locked down after the incident. He told the Guardian he crossed a footbridge that overlooks the bike path and saw �쏿ll this debris everywhere�� near what looked like a body covered by a sheet.
The home secretary, Amber Rudd, risks radicalising impressionable minds if she pursues her plan to impose 15-year prison sentences on people who view terrorist content online, a former head of counter-terrorism at the Foreign Office has warned.
Britain�셲 overpopulated prisons have proved a �쐀reeding ground for terror��, according to Sir Ivor Roberts, who also suggested that the proposal would be ruinously expensive for the Treasury.
Writing on guardian.com, the former official said it would cost 짙600,000 per inmate given the full sentence, and that the government should be focusing its efforts on forcing online hosts, such as Facebook and Twitter, to remove dangerous content.
�쏰ur prisons are brimful and can be a breeding ground for terror, which few would dispute,�� Roberts wrote. �쏧n fact, jailing impressionable but unconverted viewers of terrorist content could hasten their radicalisation by introducing them in a confined environment to more committed, and potentially persuasive, extremists.��
Following the UK terror attacks, Rudd has proposed expanding the existing counter-terrorism offence of possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist to include material that is viewed repeatedly or streamed online. Currently, the power applies only to online material that has been downloaded and stored on the offender�셲 computer, or is printed.
However, with two-thirds of prisons overcrowded, plus a penal system plagued by �쐀udget cuts and understaffing��, there are grave risks to the home secretary�셲 proposal, Roberts said. A taskforce was created in April this year to address the challenge of radicalisation in prisons.
The former ambassador to Ireland, Italy and Yugoslavia, who now sits on the advisory board of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), a thinktank, said ministers should force tech companies to fulfil their responsibilities.
A YouTube search carried out by CEP in late August delivered more than 70,000 results for the well-known Isis propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, �쐇ncluding his most incendiary lectures urging Muslims to embrace violence��.
A Home Office analysis shows that since 1 September 2016, Isis supporters have published almost 67,000 tweets in English, promoting online links to their propaganda on a range of platforms. English speakers are second only to Arabic speakers as the most important audience for supporters of Isis.
Roberts said: �쏰ptions must be assessed, and the risk of incarceration may well deter some from seeking terrorist content online. But the starting point should be to prevent access to such material in the first place.
�쏧f tech companies and other platforms �� or even the state �� can detect who is viewing this content, then surely, we should first and foremost focus on removing it. A second step혻would be to require Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, as well as smaller online platforms, to employ technology and human monitors in sufficient numbers to quickly remove illegal content.��
He added: �쏝efore jailing individuals, who can all too easily find and view terrorist content online at present, we should compel tech companies to implement strong, targeted and transparent policies for removing extremist and terrorist content so that people such as Awlaki cannot continue to stoke hatred and violence, even in death.��
A woman has been convicted of helping her husband prepare to carry out a terror attack after buying a large combat knife.Ummariyat Mirza and Madidah Taheer practised carrying out a knife attack at their home in Birmingham.Police believe the attack would have most likely taken place in the West Midlands, but say it could have happened anywhere.Taheer, 21, was convicted at Woolwich crown court in London on Thursday of preparing an act of terrorism. Her husband pleaded guilty to the charge at an earlier hearing.In 2015, before they were married, Taheer sent Mirza a message that read: �쏞an we get married already ffs. I want u to kill ppl for me. I have a list.�쒶irza replied: �쏷he day of nikkah [marriage] I�셪l kill em all. Give me the list. The only thing that stops me is we are not married. I will defo I�셫 not joking.�쒿he prosecution said these exchanges showed they were inspired by the Islamic State terror group.After the conviction, Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, the head of West Midlands counter-terrorism unit, said: �쏣arlier this year we received information that they were planning to carry out a terrorist act in the UK.�쏻e were able to establish that they were in advanced stages of preparation. We think that they had radical extreme views for some time �� back to 2015. This year they have accelerated that extremism. They had purchased a training knife to carry out a practice of the attack.
�쏷hey then bought a large hunting knife that you conceal in clothing in order to carry out an attack. We had two guilty pleas and a guilty verdict because they were sharing extremely vile and disturbing extremist material.�쏻e are confident that, had we not intervened when we did, they would have carried out an attack.�쏷he attack probably would have taken place in Birmingham or the West Midlands �� but it could have been anywhere in the UK.�쒿he couple �� along with Mirza�셲 sister, Zainab Mirza, who previously admitted sending him terrorist material �� will be sentenced later.Drive a truck down a New혻York street and knock people down, and you�셱e �쏿 sick and deranged person��. But what if you drive a혻truck혻down a New York street, knock people down and shout, �쏛llahu Akbar��? You are혻a Muslim terrorist, a global news story and a threat to the security of nations. You drive a president to �쐃xtreme vetting�� procedures and bring혻down a plague on all Muslims who혻dare to visit the United States.
When President Trump first rushed to tweet about Tuesday�셲 New York killings, he sensibly assumed the �쐂eranged person�� thesis. His one-man global newsfeed may exaggerate bad news when it involves foreign cities �� as in recent London terror attacks �� but he is reluctant to do so when the news is about his home town. Only when told about the �쏛llahu Akbar�� cry did he change his stance. Then he had to be a man of power, defender of his nation.
It appears that the culprit is yet another �쐋one wolf��. He has the familiar background of rootless immigrant, described by those know him as quiet and hard-working, an Uber driver who passed all security checks, and who had a wife and family. His entry into America in 2010 was from a country, Uzbekistan, that is not on Trump�셲 list of �쐂angerously�� Muslim places. Yet Trump could still demand an enhancement of immigration control as혻part of his �쐗ar on terror��.
Those who know and admire the United States recognise it for two qualities. The first is its robustness towards the slings and arrows of fortune, as exemplified by its attitude to gun ownership, unemployment and healthcare. America�셲 public realm borders on the callous, echoing the tough individualism of the wild west. It is proud to distance itself from the safety nets and sensitivities of Europe�셲혻welfare societies.
This was manifest last month, in Trump�셲 response to the massacre by machine gun of 58 people, and the wounding of 500 others, in Las Vegas. There was no mention of �쐃xtreme vetting�� of gun owners, despite their posing a threat a thousand times greater to Americans than any terrorist. There was no hint that any change in the criminal law, or in the wider regulation of this particular pastime, was due. Las Vegas has passed into history as just one of those things that happen. Guns are a very American form of terror.
Yet amid this toughness lurks a pathological wimpishness towards the혻outside world. The most powerful and secure nation on Earth, its territory last threatened with invasion by the British in 1815, quivers with fear before an imagined army of hostile forces massing across every border and beyond every sea. Its budget혻groans under the burden of �쐆omeland defence��. Its politics is dominated by �쐔ough on terror��. The reality is that by no stretch of geography혻is America�셲 security, let alone its existence, under threat.
This leads to a syndrome displayed by Trump and his predecessor-but-one, George W Bush: the construction of scenarios requiring presidential reaction. Bush�셲 response, desperate not to seem weak in confronting terror, was the disastrous �쐗ars of 9/11��. Trump in opposition ridiculed these wars. Yet from his first day in office, he searched for similar enemies against whom to arm his rhetoric. Hence his imposition of migration controls that have proved discriminatory, unjust and inoperable.
The politics of fear is poison to the body politic. That Britain is no less vulnerable to it was illustrated by last혻month�셲 claim by its head of MI5,혻that the nation is �쐌ore under threat than ever��. I am sure Andrew Parker is right to혻worry about Islamic State fighters returning to the UK and what they may wish to do, but it is most unlikely they will kill even remotely as many people as Britain has혻faced in many decades of homegrown terrorism, without national혻security being undermined.
Lone-wolf suicide killers are the toughest of all criminal nuts to crack. Even if it one day becomes conceivable to match facial recognition to mass surveillance, and to tail all suspect individuals and sniff out all explosives, it will remain impossible to forestall a determined suicide killer. Prevention on the ground soon degenerates into the absurd clutter now on display in London�셲 tourist West End �� a blight of ugly barriers, bollards, cones and gates. They indicate nothing beyond a city in panic-stricken thrall to terror, and no mayor with the guts to call a halt.
The reality is that a modern city-dweller is far more at risk from traffic accidents, gangland knives, air pollution and hospital infection than from terrorism. No reasonably open society can work without a degree of vulnerability. This has long included politically motivated violence. But of all혻the risks to life and limb that a modern citizen runs, such violence is almost trivial in its incidence.
Terrorism is a means to an end: that of coercive publicity. It will happen. It will happen especially where we polarise confrontations of race and religion round the world. It will happen when weak people cannot resort to armies or bombs or drones, to gain leverage in enforcing their ideas of how혻society should be run. There is no혻such thing as a terrorist state. There혻are just people who use terror as혻a혻means to an end.
The only power that can be deployed against this curse is the power of perspective. It is to treat terror as a criminal means of making a point. This has not changed since Joseph Conrad described the terrorist as �쐔errible in the simplicity of calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world �� like a pest in the street full of men��. What cannot be prevented is best accommodated. It is the psychological price we pay to live in an open and liberal society.
These dangers pale against those our혻grandparents and their forebears had to manage. We are incomparably safer than humanity has ever been before. A community that can devote so much attention to suppressing contentious gatherings, offensive remarks and �쐇nvalidations of my identity�� is not a society under existential threat. As for how best to help the traumatised people of New York, the answer is to do the opposite of what Americans did to European cities hit by such killings, which was to boycott them. The answer is to book a New혻York holiday, now.
A 20-year-old man has been charged in Victoria after counter-terrorism raids on Monday, with police alleging he was involved in preparing for planning a terrorist act in Melbourne on New Year�셲 Eve.
Ali Ali is accused of preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist attack. During an appearance at Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday afternoon he did not apply for bail and is to reappear for a committal mention on 13 March.
The Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said on Tuesday morning the suspect �쐗as intending to use a firearm to shoot and kill as many people as he could in Federation Square area on New Year�셲 Eve��.
�쏷he male is one of our high-risk persons of interest. We have been monitoring him for a very lengthy period of time. He�셲 an Australian citizen and he is of Somalian parents.��
In a joint counter-terrorism operation between state and federal police and intelligence agencies, searches were conducted at two residential properties in the south-western suburb of Werribee and the northern suburb of Meadow Heights, as well as a commercial property in Footscray, in Melbourne�셲 inner west.
The man was arrested just before 3pm on Monday. The search at his home would be �쐁omplex��, Patton said. �쏷his male did not access a firearm. I think it is very important that I provide that reassurance to the public,�� said Patton. �쏦e has been subject to our active investigation and at no stage did he access a firearm �� The arrest means that this threat has been removed.
�쏻e are quite confident that there is no risk or no threat to the Victorian community now that we have removed him from society �� there is no ongoing threat posed in respect to New Year�셲 Eve, Christmas or any other area.��
Police do not anticipate further arrests.
You just wouldn�셳 know.
On an unseasonably warm November afternoon, as New Yorkers swoosh by on bicycles, some with young kids on the back, others riding the distinctively sky-blue shareable Citi bikes, you just wouldn�셳 know that 48 hours previously this exact spot was the setting of unthinkable carnage.
You wouldn�셳 know that eight cyclists on this very West Side bike path became the latest victims of Isis�셲 global effort to instill fear in the hearts of ordinary people. You wouldn�셳 know that a path enjoyed by thousands of New Yorkers every day as they ride or jog their way along the lapping waters of the Hudson river had been turned into a mile-long killing run.
Within hours of Tuesday�셲 Home Depot truck attack more than a million New Yorkers poured back on to the streets for the annual Halloween parade, and countless thousands of other kids and their parent-minders were out trick-or-treating in their neighborhoods. By Wednesday morning, nearby schools that had been in lockdown during the attack were open for business, students and staff making long detours to reach the classrooms.
And by Thursday, the bike path, scene of that deadly drive by an Isis-inspired self-radicalized killer named by prosecutors as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, was clear once more. The cyclists were back out with a vengeance.
�쏯othing is going to keep us away from this place, no matter what,�� said Dennis Otten, 61, who had cycled down from his home in Midtown as he often does. �쏷his bike lane is so straight, so beautiful, it�셲 our way of sharing the island with everybody.��
After Tuesday�셲 attack the mood in the city is so restrained, low-key, that visitors have found it almost bewildering. Sabine Lahmann was landing at JFK from Berlin just as the terrorist suspect was turning his rented Home Depot truck into the bike path at West Houston Street.
Now she is preparing to become one of 50,000 people who will be participating �� terrorism be damned �� in the New York Marathon on Sunday. After she picked up her running number from the organisers on Thursday she came down to the bike path to witness the crime scene for herself, and was amazed by what she saw.
The path was full of cycles, the pedestrian walkway beside it thrumming with strollers and joggers and the echoing sounds of children�셲 laughter. There were none of the crowds that she had seen in Berlin after last year�셲 Christmas market attack.
�쏧t�셲 strange,�� she said. �쏧t seems almost normal.��
It takes time and concentration to get beyond that sense of surreal normality in a city that has just been brutally attacked. But the signs are there if you are open to them. Take the color yellow.
The yellow police crime-scene tape that ran the entire length of the terrorist�셲 cruel journey down the bike path has been taken down now. But other yellow objects have sprouted up to replace it.
There are the yellow vests stamped on the back with NYPD that officers are wearing as they patrol the bike path, travelling in pairs on their own police cycles. They look almost normal, like the Marathon runner said, and yet not normal.
Similar yellow vests are being worn by a different set of law enforcers �� law enforcers for God. �쏝illy Graham Rapid Response Team�� theirs are branded.
They are a team of Billy Graham chaplains who have dashed up to New York City from the televangelist�셲 headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, to pray with, provide instant spiritual guidance to (and occasionally convert) those traumatised by the attack. Their leader, Jeff Naber, has taken this �쐋aw enforcement ministry��, as they call it, to many of the recent sites of terrorist attacks.
London, Manchester, Brussels, Paris, Nice, Munich, Berlin. He was at them all.
The chaplains aim to reach each disaster zone within 24 hours, so they can offer God�셲 healing power at the time that it is most needed. �쏷he longer you let the emotional hurt fester, the worse it is,�� Naber said.
There are other signs of New York�셲 abnormal normality. As you approach Chambers Street where the killing spree ended you can see tyre marks rising up off the bike path and on to the earthen central reservation.
Two trees beside the path bear deep gashes in their bark where the Home Depot truck crashed past them. Someone has laid flowers at the base of the trees, like �쏥et better soon�� cards.
On the corner of Chambers Street itself, where the truck rammed into a school bus and screeched to a halt, a makeshift memorial has emerged around a street lamp. It is festooned in flowers and an Argentinian flag in honour of the five friends from Buenos Aires who were on a 30-year school reunion when their New York visit �� and lives �� were cut short.
�쏺iva Argentina�� has been scrawled in chalk on the bike path beside the memorial. Beside it are the words: �쏬ove one another.��
That�셲 the most overt reference to the tragedy that there is. For the most part, the city is back on its feet and not looking back. The West Side bike path is buzzing with the sounds of bicycle wheels turning.
Including the wheels of Dwight Beady, 66, a retired bank worker who lives in the Bronx and rides all over the city. The day of the attack he cycled to Brooklyn to comfort his mother.
His main emotion since Tuesday, he says, is anger for the victims. Is he intimidated?
�쏯ah, not much. With attacks like these, what are you going to do? Stay home, fill your days with avoidance? In a big city like this you can�셳 do that. The way I see it, people don�셳 get to choose what happens to them �� it�셲 the fickle finger of fate.��
By the Hudson, Steven Portes, 26, is taking a break from studies at Borough of Manhattan Community College located just over the road from the bike path. He�셲 sitting on a bench looking out at a white yacht bobbing on the river with the Jersey City skyline beyond.
He says he�셲 more aware of his surroundings since Tuesday�셲 attack, and finds himself stepping away from large crowds. But that�셲 about it. He�셲 surprised by his own composure in the wake of such violence.
He has no explanation for his �� and the city�셲 �� preternatural calm. �쏮aybe it�셲 because these senseless attacks have happened too often now,�� he says, �쐎r maybe it�셲 because New Yorkers are tough people who go about their affairs without fear.��
That�셲 a good way of looking at it. But which is it? Is it New York�셲 particular makeup as one of the world�셲 most diverse metropolises (180 languages are spoken in its public schools), a city above all others founded upon the resilience of its immigrant survivors?
Or are we witnessing a global phenomenon �� the world�셲 new normal �� where random acts of terrorist slaughter have become so frequent we are growing accustomed to them?
A pertinent place to ponder that conundrum is at Ground Zero, just four blocks away from where the killer�셲 truck came to a stop. A day after the attack, a minute�셲 silence was held here at the Survivor Tree, a callery pear that was found charred and shattered among the rubble of 9/11 but nursed back to life.
The tree now stands a lush 30ft tall close to the footprints of the Twin Towers. They say it�셲 always the last at Ground Zero to lose its leaves in the fall, and the first to burst into bloom in the spring.
�쏷hat tree has become a focus for us as the world has experienced more and more of these terrible events,�� said Alice Greenwald, president of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.
So how does she explain the city bouncing back so quickly? New York resilience, or new global resignation? �쏧t�셲 so hard to make sense of the violence,�� she says. �쏧t�셲 so indiscriminate, irrational and random in terms of its victims.��
From where she�셲 sitting, in the crucible of modern terrorism, the answer is hybrid.
�쏻e�셶e seen it time and again �� in Nairobi, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, all around the world �� horrific events to which we are becoming inured. But we�셶e also learned that people can rebound from personal grief and outrage and show defiance to the terrorists by cherishing life.��
Tuesday on a bike path in New York made it plain. Grief, outrage, affirmation for life. In today�셲 new normal we get it all.
The barrister and former terrorism watchdog David Anderson has published findings of his investigation into internal reviews by the security services and police into a wave of terror attacks in Britain this year.
Anderson studied the reviews into MI5 and counter-terror policing�셲 handling of intelligence before four terror attacks in Westminster in March, Manchester in May and London Bridge and Finsbury Park in June.
Here are some of Anderson�셲 key findings:
Egypt�셲 restive northern Sinai province, where at least 235 people were killed and scores more injured in a bomb and gun assault on a mosque on Friday, has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when Islamist militants killed more than 30 soldiers in one operation.
More than three years of fighting has failed to crush an insurgency waged by the local Islamic State affiliate, Wilayat Sinai (the Governorate of Sinai), which is also blamed for bombing attacks on churches in Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians. It had also carried out the previous deadliest attack in Sinai when it downed a Russian passenger jet carrying tourists back from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2015, killing 224 people.
The most obvious suspect for the attack in Bir al-Abed is again Wilayat Sinai, though there has been no claim of responsibility.
One clue is the target: worshippers from the mystic Sufi strand of Islam, which is frowned upon by Muslims who follow the rigorous and puritanical version of the faith associated with many Gulf countries. Isis sees Sufis as apostates, and thus not just legitimate targets, but obligatory ones.
Wilayat Sinai is one of more than a dozen Isis affiliates established by high command around the Middle East in 2014. As elsewhere, Isis leaders in Iraq used an existing local group as a base for expansion in Egypt. While other �쐅overnorates��, such as those in Libya and Algeria, have been almost entirely eliminated, Isis in Egypt has established a potent capability despite the continual efforts of the Egyptian authorities to destroy it.
�쏧t very much fits the Isis modus operandi, even if they are not the only group with the capability locally �� [Isis in Sinai] is a potent organisation,�� said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a US-based terrorism specialist.
Earlier this year Isis in Egypt had focused its assaults on Egypt�셲 Christian minority and killed dozens in at least four attacks.
In July, extremists killed 23 soldiers, including five officers, in an attack on a military checkpoint. This strike was claimed by Isis but is now thought by investigators to have been carried out by local groups affiliated to rivals al-Qaida, which is also active in Egypt.
Ayman al-Zawahiri and Saif al-Adel, the leader of al-Qaida and his most senior lieutenant, are both Egyptian, and have long been keen to expand the organisation�셲 presence in their homeland.
Al-Qaida targets military personnel, police or officials, but not ordinary Muslims, even Sufis, as part of a �쐆earts and minds strategy�� designed by al-Zawahiri. �쏛l-Qaida is not more moderate than Isis �� just more pragmatic,�� said Gartenstein-Ross.
The deeper causes of the violence in Sinai are tragically familiar from elsewhere in the Middle East.
There is the legacy of the 2011 Arab spring uprisings. The fall of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt led to political turmoil, a security vacuum in parts of the country, and the release of thousands of jailed Islamist militants. The end of Muammar Gaddafi�셲 rule in Libya released a flood of weapons.
There is also a background of deep and long-held grievances among the marginalised Bedouin tribes of the Sinai. The clumsy and brutal counter-terrorist efforts of recent years have not helped.
One hope is that the deaths on Friday will not be in vain. An attack in 1997 in Luxor killed more than 60 foreign holidaymakers, crippled the tourist industry and appalled ordinary Egyptians. It swung public opinion squarely against the extremists, limiting recruitment and fundraising, while boosting support for an invigorated counter-terrorist campaign. It was a turning point. The campaign against the extremists in Egypt desperately needs another.
Two men have appeared in court accused of preparing a homemade bomb for a terrorist attack in the UK.
Fish and chip shop owner Andy Star, 31, and Farhad Salah, 22, were arrested when counter-terrorism police officers raided their homes in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire on 19 December.
The men, both Kurdish Iraqis, are jointly charged with one count of engaging in the preparation of an act of terrorism, Westminster magistrates�� court in London heard on Friday.
The pair appeared at the hearing via a video link from Leeds magistrates court.
The court heard they were accused of possessing �쐋ow explosive black powder��. The pair were among four men arrested on 19 December.
South Yorkshire police said a 36-year-old man from Burngreave in Sheffield remained in custody, while a 41-year-old from Meersbrook in Sheffield was released on Saturday.
Star, who owns the Mermaid Fish and Chip Bar in Chesterfield, and Salah, who lives in Sheffield, were remanded in custody by District Judge Tan Ikram before a hearing at the Old Bailey on 19 January.
Star�셲 lawyer, Sajad Chaudhury, told the court: �쏷he offence is denied and at the first opportunity at the crown court he will indicate a not guilty plea.��
The number of people arrested over terrorism-related offences in Britain has risen by 54% to 400 in one of the most intense periods for attacks in recent history.
The Home Office said the increase in the year to September was due partly to the 64 arrests made after the attacks in London and Manchester, bringing the total to the highest number since records began in 2001.
The figures reflect the growing threat from Islamist terrorism in Britain. The director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, spoke in October of �쏿 dramatic upshift in the threat this year�� to �쐔he highest tempo I�셶e seen in my 34-year career��.
The figures show 12 people were arrested for the Westminster Bridge attack, 23 for Manchester Arena, 21 for London Bridge, one for Finsbury Park mosque and seven in connection with Parsons Green.
The figures also show the sharpest increase on record (77%) in the number of white people arrested, rising from 81 to 143 over the period, and the highest number (58) of women arrested for terrorism-related offences. Nearly 70% of those arrested considered themselves to be British or a British dual national.
The quarterly Home Office bulletin on police use of counter-terrorism powers shows that so far, 115 of the 400 people arrested have been charged, 213 were released without charge and 60 released on bail pending further investigation. The remainder faced alternative action.
In the 12 months to September, the terrorism-related trials of 78 people were completed, an increase of 16% on the previous year, with 69 convicted and nine acquitted.
The number of terrorist prisoners in British jails has also risen in the past year to 213, of whom 88% (187) have Islamist extremist views. A further 8% (16) are categorised as holding �쐒ightwing ideologies��.
The statistics show the Metropolitan police are making increasing use of counter-terrorism stop and search powers, with the number of stops up by 27% to 726.
The bulletin reveals that section 47a counter-terrorism stop and search powers were authorised for use after the Parsons Green attack in September for the first time since the threshold for their deployment was raised in 2011. The powers allow police to stop and search people without the need for reasonable suspicion that they are involved in terrorism.
However, the use of controversial schedule 7 powers to stop and examine people entering and leaving the UK fell by 22% to 16,919 examinations, continuing a long-term downward trend.
The reduced use of schedule 7 powers compares with the 61,711 people examined under it in 2011. Over the past six years, there has been an average year-on-year fall of 23% in the use of these powers.
The security minister, Ben Wallace, said: �쏷he police and security services have been clear that we are facing a shift rather than a short-term spike in the terrorist threat.
�쏷he statistics we are publishing today demonstrate the breadth of work that they undertake, alongside the rest of the criminal justice system, day in and day out to keep us safe.
�쏝ut this is not the totality of our work. The whole of society must come together to challenge the terrorist threat. The public must remain alert but not alarmed, and report any suspicions they have about unusual activity or behaviour to the appropriate authorities.
�쏤urthermore, the government is reviewing its counter-terrorism strategy in light of recent attacks to ensure we meet the threat from terrorism now and in the future.��
The death toll in the bombing that hit the centre of Mogadishu on Saturday continues to rise, with more than 300 people now believed to have been killed and hundreds more seriously injured.
The scale of the loss makes the attack, which involved a truck packed with several hundred kilograms of military-grade and homemade explosives, one of the most lethal terrorist acts anywhere in the world for many years.
On Monday morning, Somalia�셲 information minister announced that 276 people had died in the attack with at least 300 people injured. Within hours, however, Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Amin ambulances, said his service had confirmed that 300 people died in the blast.
�쏷he death toll will still be higher because some people are still missing,�� Abdirahman told Reuters.
More victims continue to be dug from the rubble spread over an area hundreds of metres wide in the centre of the city.
Rescue workers said a definitive death toll may never be established because the intense heat generated by the blast meant the remains of many people would not be found.
Others may have been buried quickly by relatives.
The devastating bombing, which provoked international condemnation, will focus attention on the decade-long battle against al-Shabaab, an Islamist group, in Somalia.
Michael Keating, the UN special envoy to Somalia, called the attack �쐒evolting��.
The US mission to Somalia said: �쏶uch cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism.��
Al-Shabab earlier this year vowed to increase its attacks after both the Trump administration and Somalia�셲 recently elected president announced new military efforts against the group.
Officials said more than 110 victims of the bombing had already been buried. �쏰ne hundred and sixty of the bodies could not be recognised and so they were buried by the government [on Sunday],�� Aden Nur, a doctor at the city�셲 Madina hospital, said. �쏷he others were buried by their relatives. Over a hundred injured were also brought here.��
Casualties included senior civil servants, five paramedic volunteers and a journalist, but most were ordinary people on one of the busiest thoroughfares of Mogadishu, which has been hit by multiple bombings in recent years.
The bomb, which is thought to have targeted Somalia�셲 foreign ministry, was concealed in a truck and exploded near a hotel, demolishing the building and several others.
Sources close to the Somali government said the truck had been stopped at a checkpoint and was about to be searched when the driver suddenly accelerated. It crashed through a barrier, then exploded. This ignited a fuel tanker parked nearby, creating a massive fireball.
Witnesses described bewildered families wandering among the rubble and wrecked vehicles, looking for missing relatives. Bodies were carried from the scene on makeshift stretchers made of blankets, as people tried to dig through the debris with their hands.
�쏷here�셲 nothing I can say. We have lost everything,�� said Zainab Sharif, a mother of four who lost her husband in the attack. She sat outside a hospital where he was pronounced dead after doctors tried for hours to save him from an arterial injury.
Muna Haj, 36, said: �쏷oday, I lost my son who was dear to me. The oppressors have taken his life away from him. I hate them. May Allah give patience to all families who lost their loved ones in that tragic blast �� And I pray that one day Allah will bring his justice to the perpetrators of that evil act.��
The president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning and joined thousands of people who responded to a plea by hospitals to donate blood for the wounded. �쏧 am appealing to all Somali people to come forward and donate,�� he said.
Mohamed, who took power in February, had vowed to rid the country of al-Shabaab. He has faced huge challenges, with the insurgency proving resilient to the ramped-up offensive aided by the US, and a famine.
Dr Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Mogadishu�셲 Medina hospital, said his staff had been �쐎verwhelmed by both dead and wounded. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.��
A Turkish air ambulance landed at Mogadishu airport on Monday morning to airlift 50 seriously injured people.
Al-Shabaab, which has been affiliated to al-Qaida since 2011, has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
However the organisation has a history of launching bomb attacks against civilian targets in Mogadishu, and is known to avoid claiming responsibility for operations which it believes may significantly damage its public image among ordinary Somalis.
The bombing was reported on media outlets linked to al-Shabaab.
The information minister, Abdirahman Omar Osman, said: �쏧t�셲 a sad day. This is how merciless and brutal they are, and we have to unite against them.��
One western expert working with the Somali government said the bomb was aimed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it was likely al-Shabaab had not anticipated the destruction it would cause.
�쏷hat it exploded next to a fuel tanker was just very, very bad luck,�� the expert said.
Investigators will seek to establish the source of the military-grade explosives. One source suggested they had been stolen from Amisom, the much-criticised African Union peacekeeping mission, which has about 20,000 troops in the country.
Though largely confined to the countryside since withdrawing from Mogadishu six years ago, al-Shabaab has repeatedly taken over small towns, as well as inflicting significant losses on Amisom and Somali troops.
The US military has increased drone strikes and other efforts this year against al-Shabaab, and a US special forces operative was killed in a skirmish with the group earlier this year, the first American combat casualty in Africa since the Black Hawk episode in Mogadishu in 1993.
In the main hall of the Imperial War Museum, London, the outline of a drone has been marked out in white lines by the artist James Bridle. Yet this ghostly image of 21st-century war immediately exposes the intellectual weakness of the exhibition it announces.
Do we really live in an age of terror? Looking around I am not convinced. Towering above the drone drawing is the museum�셲 most frightening and stupendous �쐔reasure��: a V2 rocket. Next to that is a V1 flying bomb. Compared with the first half of the 20th century, when two world wars ravaged humanity, ours is still �� for all its fears and troubles �� comparatively fortunate.
Perhaps that lack of fit between anxiety and reality accounts for the dubious relevance and patchy, roped-in feel of much art in this exhibition. Age of Terror makes grand claims about contemporary history that it fails to prove. The fact that Grayson Perry went into his studio the day after 11 September 2001 and added cartoon planes to the pot he was working on tells us nothing about terrorism. Just as silly is a work by the Chapman brothers called Nein! Eleven which portrays the Twin Towers as dual mounds of tiny dead Nazis. Yet these glib artworks tell us something after all: that for many people, probably most of us, terrorism is marginal. The idea touted here, that it shapes this century�셲 art, is ludicrously melodramatic and morbid.
No doubt it�셲 the last thing the curators intend, but their vision of our time is oddly similar to Donald Trump�셲. For Trump, every crime is related to Islamist terrorism and that menace justifies the destruction of democracy itself. Coming from a political polar opposite, this exhibition insists that contemporary art is shaped by the shadow of 9/11 and the consequent war on terror.
Age of Terror might be better if it got its recent history right. For instance, there are works here about the war in Syria, including Julie Mehretu�셲 eerie abstract drawing of a dying city entitled Epigraph, Damascus, and a film about children in wartime by Syrian artist Khaled Abdulwahed. Yet why does this exhibition present Syria�셲 tragedy as a chapter in the war on terror, putting these alongside works about Iraq and Afghanistan? Surely Syria�셲 war started when protests against Bashar al-Assad�셲 dictatorship were met with state violence: it grew out of the Arab spring, not western intervention. Or have I not been reading the right conspiracy websites?
A survey of artistic responses to 21st-century conflict is definitely taking on more than it can handle. Yet the powerful introduction to the exhibition reveals why it is so hard to avoid thinking of these strange times of ours in terms of terrorism. The truth is that we just can�셳 get 9/11 out of our minds.
Manhattan resident Tony Oursler saw it from up close. This powerful artist had a terrifyingly intimate view of the catastrophe and used his skills as a video artist to make his own spontaneous documentary. Oursler�셲 film 9/11 is a street-level view of the tragedy that makes you relive the cruelty and chaos of that day with terrible intimacy. He watches a body falling, exclaims on the soundtrack as the first tower falls, meets a woman waiting for news of her workmates in the Windows on the World restaurant.
Hans-Peter Feldmann collected the next day�셲 newspaper front pages from all over the world. His display makes the terrible impact of this act of terror disturbingly immediate. �쏛 declaration of war,�� said the Guardian over a full-page image of the burning towers.
9/11 provoked the best art here, which includes Indr휊 힋erpytyt휊�셲 apparently abstract painting of metallic vertical lines. It is chilling to realise they represent the facade of one of the towers as seen by someone who jumped and plummeted past this classic of modern architecture at an estimated 150 miles per hour.
It is a lot harder to be troubled by Jitish Kallat�셲 sculpture of people being frisked at airport security, in the section of the exhibition called State Control. Poor us, we have to endure tighter checks at airports now. Annoying, but compare it with the real terrors of the last century that fill this museum. A surveillance camera is not a V2, even when Ai Weiwei renders it in marble.
To describe Friday�셲 horrific gun and bomb assault on a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai peninsula as the deadliest attack by armed militants (rather than the state) in Egypt�셲 modern history understates it. It is one of the worst to happen anywhere in recent years. Officials say more than 300 worshippers, including 27 children, were killed. As in Manchester, Paris or Barcelona, families are devastated and a wider community left fearful �� as its perpetrators desired.
It is also unprecedented, despite the area�셲 troubled and bloody recent history. The escalation was not only in its scale and the ruthlessness of its organisation, but also in its target. Militants in the peninsula have killed hundreds of police and soldiers; the last year has seen them strike Coptic churches and pilgrims further afield in mainland Egypt. Sufi shrines and a 100-year-old cleric have been attacked. But this attack is the first time a mosque there has been targeted (though, like the Mogadishu truck bombing which killed more than 300 people last month, it is a powerful reminder that Muslims are the main victims of attacks by radical Islamist groups).
Much is still unclear and is likely to remain that way, not least because North Sinai has been a closed area since it was put under emergency law in 2014. Though no one has yet claimed responsibility, it is widely assumed to be the work of the Islamic State affiliate, Wilayat Sinai (�쐏rovince of Sinai��); officials say gunmen carried Isis flags. It may be that the intensity of the backlash, including condemnation from militant groups in Egypt, has deterred the perpetrators from identifying themselves. The motive is still unknown and may be multi-faceted. Isis considers Sufis heretical and one of its propaganda outlets had published an interview with a local commander in Sinai who said that tackling Sufism was a priority. Other reports have suggested the attack could be retaliation against a community that refused to cooperate with the militants, or that a rogue faction could be responsible.
As the rising toll of violence in northern Sinai shows, this is a crisis that has built over decades and accelerated in recent years. The area has been marginalised, neglected and repressed, breeding anger and resentment. Security forces as well as militants have resorted to brutal tactics in communities which they believe may be aiding their foes. Others suggest contributory factors include competition between Isis and al-Qaida; the collapse of neighbouring Libya, where Isis were pushed back but have reportedly been regrouping; and the destruction of the Isis �쐁aliphate�� in Iraq and Syria �� and the ensuing exodus of fighters and weaponry.
The experience of other countries shows there is rarely an easy explanation for radicalisation. It also highlights the temptation for governments to rush to extraordinary measures, from tightened restrictions to the brute use of force, in staving off terror attacks. Such measures not only contradict the values they seek or purport to uphold, but can also prove counter-productive in fuelling grievances and bolstering militant groups.
Egypt�셲 president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi was quick to vow �쐀rute force�� and vengeance in response to Friday�셲 attack. Within hours, the government said it had launched airstrikes on �쐔errorist�� locations. The speed of the action itself raised questions for some: if they could be targeted so quickly, they must presumably have been identified before, so why had they not been tackled?
Even his dogged allies in the US, who kept their lips sealed when he ousted the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in a coup in 2013, are understood to have stressed the need for a proper counter-insurgency strategy that goes beyond striking bases �� albeit while selling Cairo great quantities of the arms used to target militants (and while Donald Trump appears unstinting in his support for his counterpart). The UK has been more consistent in its message, but for multiple reasons, is unlikely to press too hard. Yet as Alistair Burt, minister of state for the Middle East, pointed out this weekend, confronting such extremism requires tackling it in a variety of ways �� including by addressing the underlying causes drawing people towards militancy.
If there are indications that Cairo�셲 thinking is beginning to take such ideas into account, as some think, the change is not yet obvious on the ground. But relying on brute force is likely to take a further toll on innocent citizens in northern Sinai, and cannot protect them from the kind of attackers who struck al-Rawdah mosque.
�� This article was amended on 30 November 2017. An earlier version misspelled al-Rawdah mosque as al-Radwa.
Introducing new laws to prosecute extremists would be wrong, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has said.
Terrorists who commit modest or middle-ranking offences should not face longer jail terms, Max Hill also suggested.
In a speech in central London, Hill warned against a �쐊neejerk reaction�� to the wave of terrorist attacks on England in recent months as he raised concerns about government plans for new laws.
He questioned proposals announced by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, to impose jail terms of up to 15 years on people who repeatedly viewed terrorist content online.
Hill said �쐖ery careful work�� would be required to stop innocent people being caught up by the offence.
Theresa May declared �쐃nough is enough�� as England was left reeling from a spate of atrocities this year and vowed to crack down on extremism.
Hill said �쐔hought without action�� must not be criminalised. �쏻hile we can all agree that there should be nowhere for real terrorists to hide, we should also agree that legislating in the name of terrorism when the targeted activity is not actually terrorism would be quite wrong.
�쏻e do not, and should not criminalise thought without action or preparation for action. Thought with steps towards action can be terrorism. Thought without action or preparation for action may be extremism, but it is not terrorism.��
The barrister told the human rights group Justice that terrorism sentences had been toughened up significantly over the past 30 years, but suggested political desire rather than need was behind the changes in less serious cases.
�쏧 do not contend that this was an unnecessary shift, in relation to the most serious cases, but it begs the question whether in more modest or middle-ground terrorist offences there is a real need �� as opposed to a political desire �� to mark the offenders with far longer terms in jail,�� he said.
A number of offences were used rarely so trimming some of the legislation would �쐀e a good thing��, Hill added.
�쏧n general, I would suggest that our legislators, parliament, have provided for just about every descriptive action in relation to terrorism, so we should pause before rushing to add yet more offences to the already long list,�� he said.
Hill said he was often told there was �쐎ne law for Muslims and another for the rest��, adding: �쏮any feel that charging the killer of Jo Cox MP with murder, rather than a specific terrorist offence, was evidence of �쁮ne law for some, another for the rest��.��
The government must take a more proactive role to speak to Muslim communities, and not only at a time when things have gone wrong, Hill advised.
France�셲 decision to declare a state of emergency after repeated terrorist attacks was �쐍ot correct�� and the UK must avoid such a move, he said. National security must not be �쐕sed as a stick to beat down the rights we hold dear��.
Hill said: �쏻e, as a nation, must not be terrified, nor must we allow our parliament to enact measures that might make things worse not better.��
A No 10 spokeswoman said: �쏛s we have seen painfully in the UK this year, we face an unpredictable threat from terrorism. We have to tackle the ideologies that drive or inspire these kinds of attacks.
�쏷hat is why we are doing things like establishing a new commission on countering extremism to help expose all forms of extremism and division and to challenge those who preach hate.
�쏻hat we want to do is to send a clear message that we will not tolerate terrorism, those who help radicalise terrorists with their extremist views, or those who turn a blind eye to terrorist activity.��
On Friday, more than 300 Muslim worshippers were murdered in a mosque, and scores more injured, by presumably extremist Islamists in Egypt. There are quite likely a few reasons why this attack took place when it did, including the rejection of radical groups by the residents of this northern Sinai village. But one reason is a deeply ideological one, which relates to the Sufi tendency of many of those massacred. That ideological component goes far beyond this particular attack �� and, indeed, beyond one particular group. It is a problem that Muslim communities the world over must all tackle �� a virulent strain of extremist thought that ironically rejects orthodoxy, while insisting it is the most orthodox.
In much of the international reportage around this brutal massacre, words such as �쏶ufi minority�� were used, as though Sufism was some kind of marginalised sect or cult, somehow dubiously related to Islam. That perception is not the perspective of the mainstream of Islamic thought. Historically, Sufism was regarded by Islamic scholars as being an integral part of the broader religious disciplines, and the practices of Sufis as being part and parcel of religious devotions. Celebrating the birthday of the prophet, for example, which takes place all year round but intensifies during this particular month, might be called a �쏶ufi practice�� �� but Muslims have celebrated that irrespective of whether or not they were affiliated to a particular Sufi order.
To describe Sufism as a sect, in that regard, would be akin to describing the different legal rites of Sunni Islam as �쐓ects�� �� which would be rather peculiar. Of course, this is precisely what the extremists do. Extremists will often declare in their rhetoric that Sufis are guilty of shirk (idolatry) due to their bida (deviance). The irony is that while such extremists insist that they are following the most �쐏ure�� version of Islam, they have rejected a fundamental part of what actually constitutes mainstream Islamic thought.
In that regard, such extremists are themselves a sect �� not those whom they attack. The tremendous majority of Islamic scholarship is deeply and indelibly influenced by Sufism, and Islam�셲 most famous figures upheld it as a core part of the faith. There were critics of certain excesses, to be sure �� but they were also Sufis themselves.
Sitting alongside this is the incorrect narrative that Sufis are somehow the �쐌oderate�� or �쐏eaceful�� part of the global Muslim community. To declare them as such is to fall into the framing that Sufis are somehow wholly distinguishable from the broad and overwhelming majority of Muslims �� they are not. The framing also suggests that the broad majority of Muslims are not peaceful or moderate, and that these �쏶ufi Muslims�� are some kind of exception.
While some may wish to promote that kind of dichotomy, it�셲 a rather baseless one �� the overwhelming majority of Muslims are not extreme, but are peaceful. It�셲 because of that reality that they, as Muslims, are the primary victims of groups such as Islamic State. Moreover, Sufis throughout history, as Muslims, have fought in martial endeavours, such as against crusader armies in Egypt or against Bashar al-Assad�셲 forces in Syria.
Second, it is important to be aware that it is not just extremist Islamists who deny the historical authenticity of Sufism within Islam. It is true that the likes of Isis and others have declared their open rejection of Sufism, and their media outlets have been inciting violence against Sufis for quite some time. But that rhetoric does not come out of a vacuum.
There are scores of preachers who are influenced by purist Salafi notions of what proper Islam ought to look like, who have been speaking against Sufism and Sufis for a very long time indeed. While some leading Sufi figures have often been rather uncompromising in their own views, Sufi traditions recognise the plurality of Islam, which is at the core of their own critique of purist Salafism �� that the latter fails to recognise that pluralism.
It must be stated clearly: purist Salafis by and large do not preach vigilante violence and militancy, and they should not be held accountable en masse for the atrocity of Friday. But the rhetoric many purist Salafis employ against Sufism more generally, and Sufis in particular, provides a certain type of background noise that more radical extremists will quite happily exploit all over the world, for a variety of nefarious purposes.
For decades, there have been figures trained in countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, who have preached that not only is Sufism not integral to Islam, but that it is a rejection of it. Those figures are not simply on a few fiery pulpits on the Arabian peninsula �� they are much further afield, in Muslim majority communities as well as Muslim minority ones. That reality is not simply true of post-1979, despite what Riyadh may now claim �� rather, it goes back much further than that, and any �쐁ounter-extremism�� approach needs to recognise that.
Extremism is not an intrinsically Muslim problem, and it ought not to be considered as such. But there is an extremist ideology that exists, and its manifestations are not simply to be found in the outrageous barbarism that befell Egypt on Friday.
If we are to tackle extremism in general, it isn�셳 a �쐒eformation of Islam�� that anyone ought to be looking for. Indeed, in a sense, that took place already, and one result of that was the extremist rejection of orthodox Sufism by many, who then claimed to be more orthodox than anyone else. Any holistic response to the challenge of extremism will need to address precisely that fallacy.

A married couple from Birmingham who practised carrying out Islamic State-inspired knife attacks on a dummy in their home have been jailed for preparing acts of terrorism.Ummar Mirza, 21, was sentenced at Woolwich crown court to 16 years in prison in London on Wednesday for preparing acts of terrorism in the UK.Madihah Taheer, 22, was jailed for 10 years after purchasing a combat knife for her husband.
The pair had long discussed carrying out an attack, exchanging messages before they were married in September 2015 in which Taheer wrote: �쏞an we get married already ffs. I want you to kill ppl for me. I have a list.��
Mirza replied: �쏷he day of the nikkah [marriage] I�셪l kill em all. Give me the list. The only thing that stops me is we are not married. I will defo ... I�셫 not joking.��
Taheer, who has recently become a mother, was convicted of preparing an act of terror in October this year, while her husband pleaded guilty to the charge at an earlier hearing.When police raided the couple�셲 home in Birmingham, they found a life-like training dummy with slash marks across its forehead, throat and abdomen.
Prior to his arrest, Mirza had carried out a number of internet searches on the best knife to buy, how to commit the �쐏erfect murder��, and how to kill someone with a knife.
After acquiring a combat knife, purchased by his wife, Mirza researched targets including Jewish areas in London and Birmingham, and barracks and Territorial Army bases in Birmingham.
Two days before Mirza was arrested he had also been searching reports about a Birmingham flat being linked to the Westminster terror attack, and on the Westminster attacker Khalid Masood.
Messages between the couple produced in court showed them discussing the purchase of a training dummy, with Mirza preferring a neoprene model over a plastic one.One message from him to Taheer said: �쏧 know the difference in feeling. [The] same way I like hitting you. It is fun. It feels nice to hit, so to feel flesh contort under the force.�쒾entencing Mirza, Judge Christopher Kinch QC said he had shown �쐇nexorable progress�� towards a lone-wolf attack, adding the 21-year-old had �쐌oved from speculative ideas to sourcing equipment, to training and searching for possible targets��.
�쏷he harm which might have been caused is undoubtedly high,�� Kinch said. �쏧 am satisfied having regard to all the material I have read that you pose a significant risk of serious harm being caused to members of the public from the commission of further specified offences.��
Speaking about Taheer�셲 case, Kinch described it as a �쐏ersonal tragedy�� because the October trial came when her first child was just five months old.
During the trial, the Crown Prosecution Service had argued the conversations between the couple showed that Taheer was a �쐗illing accomplice�� who knew what Mirza wanted to use the knife for, illustrating �쏿 shared belief in violent pro-jihad, Islamic State extremism��.
Also sentenced on Wednesday was Zainub Mirza, Mirza�셲 sister, who shared Isis propaganda with the couple on social media.The 24-year-old was sentenced to 30 months in prison, having already pleaded guilty to five counts of disseminating terrorist publications.
The court heard that Mirza�셲 sister sent him videos relating to extremism, including some showing Isis fighters beheading hostages.
In one message, she said to her brother: �쏮ay Allah give us the ability to raise our children to fight for Allah.��
Speaking after the conviction of Taheer in October, Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, the head of West Midlands counter-terrorism unit, said: �쏣arlier this year we received information that they were planning to carry out a terrorist act in the UK.
�쏻e were able to establish that they were in advanced stages of preparation. We think that they had radical extreme views for some time �� back to 2015. This year they have accelerated that extremism. They had purchased a training knife to carry out a practice of the attack.
�쏷hey then bought a large hunting knife that you conceal in clothing in order to carry out an attack. We had two guilty pleas and a guilty verdict because they were sharing extremely vile and disturbing extremist material.�쏻e are confident that, had we not intervened when we did, they would have carried out an attack.��

Britain�셲 security services are to escape further scrutiny by parliament�셲 intelligence and security committee for their failure to prevent four terror attacks this year in which 36 people died.
The decision comes as the home secretary, Amber Rudd, gave her backing to an increased role for MI5 in tackling domestic extremism, including that carried out by rightwing terrorists and groups. MI5 already play an important role in combating Islamist terrorism.
A report on the performance of MI5 and counter-terror police published by David Anderson QC on Tuesday did not purport to provide independent scrutiny but instead �쏿ssessed the quality�� of nine unpublished internal reviews into the services�� handling of intelligence.
Anderson concluded that �쐔heir investigative actions in all cases were for the most part sound�� but did identify failings that meant it was �쐁onceivable that the Manchester [Arena] attack in particular might have been avoided if the cards had fallen differently��.
Among other failings, the internal reviews established that the Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi, had been identified by �쐔argeted data exploitation and other automated techniques�� as one of a small number of individuals who merited further examination. A meeting to discuss them was scheduled for 31 May, but the attack at Manchester Arena happened on 22 May.
Critical headlines about the performance of the security services were overshadowed first by an MI5 statement disclosing that nine UK terror plots had been thwarted since March and later on Tuesday by the news that two suspects had been charged over an alleged plot to kill Theresa May.
The intelligence and security committee (ISC), which is parliament�셲 principle means of holding MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to account, has had no opportunity to examine this year�셲 terrorist attacks as it was only set up on 23 November after months of delay. Its chairman, Dominic Grieve, said after its first meeting since the election that consideration of the attacks would be the committee�셲 �쐔op priority��.
But on Tuesday Grieve told MPs that �쐒ather than just trying to reinvent the wheel in respect of what Mr Anderson has done, we will endeavour to maximise the efficiency of both services��. He said the ISC�셲 main focus in its independent inquiry should be on ensuring recommended changes �쐇n the way in which the work of the counter-terrorism agencies and MI5 is linked in the sharing of intelligence.��
Further public scrutiny of whether the security services could have avoided the attacks will now take place through the formal inquest process, which is expected to be lengthy.
Rudd has however not ruled out a public inquiry if coroners believe they cannot deal with all the issues raised through the inquest process.
An increased role for MI5 in tackling domestic extremism was one of three major recommendations proposed by the security services.
The new approach is aimed at ensuring that equal weight is given in analysing and dealing with all kinds of terrorism, irrespective of the ideology that inspires them. The decision will mean that the joint terror analysis centre, which sets the national threat level, should include in its work an assessment of terrorist threats arising from domestic extremism.
In recent years controversy over the definition of domestic extremism has seen the police redefine it as �쏿ctivity of groups or individuals who commit or plan serious criminal activity motivated by a political or ideological viewpoint��. This has included animal rights, environmental activists as well as far-right racists.
An ISC spokesperson said: �쏯o decisions on the scope of the committee�셲 inquiry have yet been taken and the committee continues to closely scrutinise the Anderson report, as well as the MI5 and police internal reviews.�쒷ational security experts have criticized the departments of justice and homeland security, describing a report that attempts to link terrorism and immigration as misleading, �쏿wfully thin�� and of �쐋ittle value�� to the US.The Trump administration claimed the report demonstrated a need for stricter immigration policies, though it presented little new information on terrorism convictions and omitted key data points and context.
Alistair Millar, chairman of the board of directors at the Global Center on Cooperative Security, a nonpartisan thinktank, said the report distorted terrorism numbers to suggest foreign-born people carry out the majority of terrorist attacks in the US.
�쏷hey are really skewing the data, almost coincidentally, it seems, with this fever-pitch attempt to get people from coming from certain countries into the US,�� Millar told the Guardian.
The report concentrates on the 549 people convicted of terrorism-related charges in US federal courts from 11 September 2001 to 31 December 2016, 254 of whom were not American citizens, while 148 were naturalized citizens and 147 citizens born in the US. In all, 402 of the 549 people were foreign-born; 295 were US citizens.
National security experts were quick to note that the report did not distinguish which people were brought to the US for trial versus those who had immigrated there first. The report also included people who were charged with terrorism-related offenses carried out overseas.
�쏧t�셲 an awfully thin report for an absolutely important topic,�� Karen Greenberg, director of Fordham University�셲 Center on National Security, told the Washington Post. �쏷here�셲 almost no rhyme or reason to the things they choose to include or not include �� they don�셳 explain it.��
Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the report for failing to introduce new information. �쏧t�셲 remarkable that, given almost a year to produce such a report and with the vast resources of the federal government combined with reams of government information unavailable to the public, that they were able to produce a report of so little of value,�� he wrote for the thinktank.
In the Cato Institute�셲 own analysis of terrorism, it found that from 2002 to 2017, native-born Americans were responsible for 78% of murders in terrorist attacks in the US.
Trump provoked further criticism with a tweet about the report that did not include the word �쐇nternational�� �� implying that most people convicted of terrorism in the US are foreign-born, when the report is specific to people convicted on charges of international terrorism. �쏻e need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based,�� Trump said.
The report was also criticized for ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism, which resulted in 225 deaths from 12 September 2001 to the end of 2016, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study. The study said violent extremist groups with far-right beliefs were responsible for 73% of the 85 incidents counted in the report, while radical Islamist extremists were responsible for 27%.
The DHS and DOJ�셲 joint 11-page report was released the same day that the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, testified before Congress for a routine update on the department.
�쏷hey are obviously trying to make news with the report but I�셫 not sure it�셲 going to have a real long-term effect on the overall immigration discussion,�� said James Norton, a deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at the homeland security department under George W Bush.
Norton said the report was another example of the administration�셲 hardline position on new, strict immigration policies, including several versions of a travel ban, capping refugee admissions and ending temporary protected status for people from four different countries.
�쏛 lot of folks are hopeful that we can find some ways to improve parts of the system, at least in the short term, to get to a broader fix,�� Norton said. �쏝ut it doesn�셳 seem like there is a lot of willingness to do that.��
The DHS and DOJ report was published to comply with a March 2017 executive order that first banned entry to the US for people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The order has since expired and been replaced with a new travel ban.
Police officers have been given until Christmas Day to decide whether to charge four men held as part of an operation to foil a suspected Christmas terrorist attack.
Chip shop owner Andy Sami Star, 31, and three other men, aged 22, 36 and 41, are being questioned by police after raids in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire on Tuesday morning.Specialist teams returned on Wednesday to the scene of one arrest in Chesterfield to help with ongoing searches, the north-east counter-terrorism unit said.The force has asked residents to be �쏿lert but not alarmed�� after Tuesday�셲 raid on Mermaid Tradition Fish Bar which involved an army bomb squad.
In Sheffield on Wednesday, counter-terrorism officers flew a drone back and forth over the Fatima community centre in Burngreave which, along with a mosque, had been sealed off. Some officers later climbed on to the flat roof of the centre to take a closer look at targets identified in the drone�셲 video footage, while others donned protective clothing to search through bins outside the building.
Residents had reported being woken early on Tuesday by a series of loud bangs and seeing camouflaged officers with guns. Witnesses said a man was later taken from the property.The four men being questioned by police at a station in West Yorkshire are being held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Police said the arrests were �쐇ntelligence-led and pre-planned�� as part of an ongoing investigation.
Amar Ghaman, the volunteer manager at the Fatima, which is located in a semi-industrial area north of the city centre, said there was nothing �쐓trange going on here and nothing for the Muslim community to worry about��.
One resident of a four-storey block of flats opposite said police had advised him and other residents to evacuate on Tuesday evening.
�쏻e went to our daughter�셲 for a couple of hours but then came back,�� said Terry, aged 67. �쏯othing has happened since the raids. I heard three loud bangs and then saw lots of police in military fatigues.
�쏧 saw them bring one guy out. He was between two policemen so I couldn�셳 see him clearly.��
He described the area as a mix of different cultures. �쏧t�셲 very friendly, everyone gets on,�� he said. �쏻e�셶e got Somali neighbours, it�셲 all good.��
Around three miles south in the Meersbrook area of the city, residents said they were woken on Tuesday by police blowing open the door of a run-down terrace house as armed officers in protective gear swooped in the early hours. A further raid is understood to have happened at a property in Stocksbridge, just north of Sheffield.Counter-terrorism teams are running about 500 live investigations involving 3,000 individuals at any one time, while there is also a wider pool of 20,000 people who were the subjects of previous inquiries.
We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!��
Plots by three alleged Islamic State supporters to carry out terrorist attacks around New York City, including at concert venues, subway stations and Times Square, were foiled in the summer of 2016, a US court has heard.
Terrorism charges against the three men accused of plotting the attacks were unsealed by a federal court in the city on Friday.
The plots were thwarted by an undercover FBI agent who was posing as an Islamist extremist and communicating with the trio via a messenger app.
One of the defendants, Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, was arrested after travelling from Canada to New Jersey in May 2016 to carry out the attacks, authorities said.
According to criminal complaints, Bahnasawy, 19, told the undercover agent that ��[t]hese Americans need an attack��, and he wanted to �쐁reate the next 9/11��. He sent the agent an image of Times Square and said: �쏻e seriously need to car bomb times square. Look at these crowds of people!��
In another message, he said he wanted to �쐓hoot up concerts cuz they kill a lot people �� We just walk in with guns in our hands. That�셲 how Paris guys did it,�� the papers said in an apparent reference to the 2015 attack on the Bataclan concert hall in the French capital that killed 89 people.
Bahnasawy pleaded guilty in October 2016, but the case was sealed while the investigation continued. His attorney, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment on Friday.
The other men are Talha Haroon, who was arrested in Pakistan, and Russell Salic, who was arrested in the Philippines, where he is a citizen. Both are awaiting extradition to the US.
Haroon, who was introduced to the agent by Bahnasawy, was planning to travel to the US to allegedly help him with the attacks.
In messages, he told the agent that the subway was a perfect target; that they should shoot as many passengers on the train as possible, including women and children; and that �쐗hen we run out of bullets we let the vests go off��.
Salic, who is a doctor and is accused of sending money to help fund the planned attacks, was also arrested in the Philippines for his alleged involvement in kidnappings and beheadings blamed on pro-Isis militants, a Philippine official said.
The chief state counsel, Ricardo Paras, told the Associated Press that a Manila court was considering an extradition request from the US government. Even if the court approves the request, the Department of Justice in Manila needs to decide whether Salic will face charges in the Philippines first or be allowed to be flown to the US to answer the terrorism financing allegations there, Paras said.
�쏷he US can also request for a temporary surrender of Salic to its custody, but it�셲 in our options to require him to face criminal complaints here first,�� Paras said.
A US Department of Justice statement said: �쏞ommunicating through internet messaging applications, these three men allegedly plotted to conduct bombings and shootings in heavily populated areas of New York City during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 2016, all in the name of Isis.��
The men face possible terms of life in prison on charges including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists.
A suspicious package that prompted the evacuation of a Christmas market near Berlin on Friday was not terror-related but part of an attempt to blackmail the German logistics firm DHL, police say.
The delivery of the parcel containing nails and an improvised explosive device to a pharmacy in the city of Potsdam triggered the temporary evacuation of the nearby Christmas market.
Germany remains on high alert for potential terrorist attacks nearly a year after a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked articulated lorry into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 11 people.
But officials on Sunday ruled out a terror motive in the latest incident after finding a blackmail letter targeted at DHL, whose services were used to deliver the parcel.
�쏷he good news is that we can say, with all likelihood, that the package was not aimed at the Christmas market,�� said the Brandenburg state interior minister, Karl-Heinz Schr철ter. �쏷he bad news is it was a blackmail attempt targeting the DHL delivery service.��
Brandenburg state�셲 police president, Hans-J체rgen M철rke, said investigators had spent Saturday reassembling a piece of paper with a QR code, which had been torn to shreds during the controlled explosion of the parcel. The QR code contained a message directed at DHL, asking for a sum of several million euros in blackmail money.
Linking Friday�셲 events to the delivery of a similar parcel in Frankfurt on the Oder in early November, Schr철ter said current investigations suggested that the blackmailer was acting mainly in the Berlin and Brandenburg area.
Authorities also confirmed that the device could have exploded and seriously injured people.
DHL has so far declined to comment on the case, according to Bild newspaper.
The German logistics market leader, which is part of Deutsche Post, delivered 1.2bn parcels in the country last year, including 8.4m packages on its Christmas peak day alone.
Qatar�셲 foreign minister has claimed the root cause of Middle East terrorism lay in authoritarian rulers, and lack of human rights, presenting Qatar as a more reliable western ally in the fight against terror than �쐇mpulsive, crisis-making�� Saudi Arabia.
Speaking in front of British ministers at a Qatar-sponsored anti-terror conference in London, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani stressed his country�셲 commitment to use political and economic policies, as well as security measures to attack extremism�셲 �쐀reeding ground of injustice and authoritarianism��.
Qatar is run by a royal family and critics claim the Doha-based broadcaster al-Jazeera is more free to criticise other Gulf states than its hosts, but the emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, announced this month that Qatar would hold elections for a 45-strong consultative shura council in 2019.
Such elections have been delayed three times, but pressure from the publicity of holding the World Cup in 2022, and the country�셲 ongoing dispute with Saudi Arabia, is thought to make a fourth postponement less likely. Qatar is also revising its much-criticised labour laws and plans to grant citizenship rights to some expatriates.
Qatar is due to burnish its anti-terror credentials next month by establishing in cooperation with Britain an International Centre for Excellence in Countering Terrorism. Plans to announce the centre at Thursday�셲 conference were cancelled due to the need to finalise details, including whether it would be based in London, the foreign minister said.
The centre, likely to be seen as a rival to a similar facility launched by Saudi Arabia alongside Donald Trump earlier this year, is expected to highlight not just security measures, but also how to counter the social and political breeding grounds for terrorism.
Thani, the foreign minister, accused the Saudi leadership of fracturing the region, adding �쏿 pattern is emerging when they create a new crisis to cover up previous crises��.
He said Saudi Arabia �쐆ad created a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, divided the Gulf states by attacking Qatar without an exit strategy and tried to pressurise the Lebanese prime minister to resign leaving a vacuum. Which policy of theirs has so far produced a positive result? It has all been counter-productive to stability in the region��.
Qatar has been locked in a bitter dispute for five months after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposed a land, sea and air blockade, accusing the Doha royal family of harbouring and funding terrorist groups such as Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist Syrian groups.
Thani said the accusation was a pretext �� designed to appeal to the west �� to mount an attack on Qatar�셲 sovereignty and political outlook.
US, European and Kuwaiti efforts at mediation have failed, but so far Qatar�셲 economy, founded on the export of liquid gas, has suffered little long-term damage.
Qatar�셲 foreign minister, on a tour of western capitals, clearly regards Saudi Arabia�셲 recent foreign policy adventures as a boon in his efforts to persuade western governments it is the more reliable counter-terror partner.
With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, due in Doha before the end of the year, Thani urged the Saudi crown prince not to provoke a war with Iran, saying �쐗e cannot afford to open up another crisis��.
Calling for an end to the instability in the Middle East, he said: �쏱opulations fall prey to extremist groups if rulers seek power, practise bad governance and strip populations of their human rights and dignity.
�쏳ecent examples of the catastrophes created by evil ideologies can be found across my region: children who have lived through the mass atrocities of the Syrian regime, Isis in Iraq and Syria, or the war in Yemen are now young adults with little hope for a better future.�� He said the risk was that such conflicts will breed a new generation of young extremists.
In an attempt to puncture Qatar�셲 anti-terror credentials, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Egypt declared a further two entities and 11 more individuals as terrorists on Thursday, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood with links to Qatar.
The quartet added the Qatar-based International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) to their list of organisations and individuals who disseminate or support terrorism, saying the groups were working to promote terrorism through the exploitation of Islamic discourse��. The International Islamic Council for Relief was also added to the list.
The IUMS was formed in 2004 and is headed by the influential Egyptian theologian Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi. Most of those who formed the council are said to be members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which led the Arab spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the Middle East and north Africa.
The 11 individuals include Khaled Nazem Diab, the director of relief and international development at the Qatar Red Crescent, Hassan Ali Mohammed Juma Sultan, a Bahraini dissident, and the acting general leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mahmoud Ezzat.
Others on the list include the Muslim Brotherhood leader, Alaa Ali al-Samahi, and Egyptian dissidents such as Qadri Mohamed Fahmy Mahmoud al-Sheikh.
The quartet again accused Qatar of aiding terrorism, saying the individuals had �쐁arried out various terrorist operations in which they have received direct Qatari support at various levels, including providing them with passports and assigning them to Qatari institutions with a charitable appearance to facilitate their movement��.
Turkey�셲 president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an, has accused the US of forming a �쐔error army��, after Washington announced plans for a 30,000-strong force inside Syria to protect territory held by its mainly Kurdish allies.
On Sunday, the US-led coalition said it was working with its Syrian militia allies, the mainly Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to set up the new border force. The force would operate along the borders with Turkey and Iraq, as well as within Syria along the Euphrates river, which separates most SDF territory from that held by the government. The announcement was one of the few insights into the Trump administration�셲 longer-term thinking for Syria.
The SDF is dominated by the Kurdish YPG, and the plan for the force dashes Turkish hopes that the US would abandon the YPG once the war against Islamic State came to an end. Turkey regards the Kurdish YPG militia as indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers�� party (PKK) operating inside Turkey, which it regards as a terror group.
�쏛 country we call an ally is insisting on forming a terror army on our borders,�� Erdo휓an said in a speech in Ankara. �쏻hat can that terror army target but Turkey? Our mission is to strangle it before it�셲 even born.��
Russia also opposed the plan, saying it could lead to the partitioning of Syria. For its part, the Syrian regime vowed to win back control of the entire country, including by removing any form of US-backed Syrian Kurdish force. The US plan was a blatant attack on Syrian sovereignty, Syria said.
Relations between Turkey and the US have unravelled in recent weeks, partly due to rows over the president�셲 planned visa restrictions. Turkey is also angry at the support the US continues to provide to the Syrian Kurdish forces that formed the backbone of the SDS, which led the military assault on Islamic State troops based in Raqqa.
Turkey sent troops into Syria in 2016 to prevent Syrian Kurdish fighters from forming a contiguous entity along its border. It has also supported rival Syrian rebels and independently fought to drive Isis from parts of Syria.
Turkey, a Nato member, said it would shortly mount an assault on the Kurdish-held Syrian town of Afrin, close to the Turkish border.
Erdogan said preparations for the military assault on Afrin �쏿re complete,�� adding that an operation could start any moment. He said Turkish troops are already firing artillery at Afrin from the border.
The Syrian government warned it �쐁onsiders any Syrian who participates in these militias sponsored by the Americans as a traitor to their people and nation, and will deal with them on this basis��.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, giving his annual foreign policy press conference, described the US move as provocative and unilateral.
Russia and Iran, at the invitation of the Syrian government, are planning to keep forces inside Syria once the conflict ends. The planned border force may be seen as a bargaining chip, showing the US also has a stake in Syria�셲 future, including a tool with which to press Russia to negotiate on Assad�셲 future.
The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria and has said they will stay in the country until it is certain Islamic State is defeated, and progress is made in UN-led peace talks in Geneva on ending the conflict. The US is frustrated Russia has not put pressure on the regime of Syria�셲 president, Bashar al-Assad, to negotiate at Geneva, but instead is pressing ahead with its own peace talks, the Syrian national dialogue congress scheduled this month at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
My twin sister, Eleanor, is not a terrorist. It is absurd to have to write this. Three months ago �� after travelling to Scotland to attend our grandfather�셲 funeral �� she was detained at Edinburgh airport under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. She was forced to hand over her passwords for her mobile phone and computer; she was interrogated about the political beliefs of her relatives (myself included); and then was driven from the airport to a police station to have her DNA sample and fingerprints taken. After being detained for four hours, she missed her flight back to Berlin, where she lives: the police refused to even pay the cost of a ticket for a new flight.
Here�셲 the background. My sister took part in July�셲 protests at the G20 summit in Hamburg. She was sprayed by water cannon and tear gas, witnessed police brutality and, in the melee, fell and injured her legs. She was later arrested on suspicion of being in the anarchist black bloc (she wasn�셳), detained for 36 hours and released without charge.
Her first arrest itself represented an attack on the civil liberties of a peaceful protester. The second detention can hardly be construed as anything other than an attempt to intimidate and harass someone exercising their fundamental democratic rights �� using legislation supposedly designed to prevent would-be murderers committing atrocities. The Labour MSP Neil Findlay has written to Scotland�셲 justice minister with a series of questions about my sister�셲 case: including whether the detention was fair, justified or proportionate; about the tactics Police Scotland used against �쏿 wholly innocent UK citizen��; and asking who authorised the action.
No one rational disputes the need for laws to protect people from the threat of terror. It is not unreasonable, after all, to expect anti-terrorism legislation to be used to target terrorists. When such laws were introduced, critics suggested they would threaten civil liberties and infringe on the rights of the innocent. They were smeared as scaremongers, and yet they were vindicated.
Eleanor is herself desperate to emphasise that she has a privileged position. She is a white woman whose brother is a newspaper columnist. �쏧�셫 more worried about people who don�셳 have my privileges or voice who are wrongfully harassed by this law,�� she tells me. �쏧 want my case to be used to bring attention to their injustice.��
Schedule 7, a legacy of New Labour authoritarianism, grants the police sweeping and unchecked powers at the border: at airports, ports and international train stations. �쏧t allows the police to detain and question someone without any suspicion of wrongdoing,�� says Millie Graham Wood, a solicitor at Privacy International. �쏛nd so they are often suffered by people who have done nothing wrong.��
If few of those who are targeted by section 7 go on to challenge it �� perhaps feeling embarrassed or intimidated, or simply not wanting further hassle �� then the police clearly feel that they can get away with it.
As my sister puts it, white people like her are not normally the victims. Schedule 7 reeks of racism. According to Liberty, in 2010/11 45% of those targeted were Asian, 21% black, and a mere 8% white. The police can question those they detain for up to six hours, and keep their possessions for up to a week, while the detained have no right to remain silent and no right to a lawyer. Their basic civil rights are suspended.
The forcible downloading of data from laptops and mobile phones is chilling too. In the modern era, our entire lives are contained on these devices, including the most sensitive and personal details. Allowing strangers to scour through our photos and information on everything from our sexuality to medical conditions is horribly intrusive, humiliating even. And the disproportionate targeting of minority Britons is a form of state-sanctioned harassment that should concern us all.
As David Anderson QC �� the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation �� puts it, there is an �쏿bsence of a suspicion threshold for some of the more intrusive powers under schedule 7��. Yet the government has refused to accept his recommendation for such a threshold �� meaning that innocent people will continue to have their civil liberties infringed. Indeed, David Miranda �� partner of the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald �� was detained under the clause four years ago. As a court of appeal judgment into his detention later found, schedule 7 was incompatible with the European convention on human rights.
Other activists have suffered my sister�셲 fate: in 2009 the climate change campaigner Chris Kitchen was prevented from travelling to Copenhagen for the climate change talks. In 2012 anarchists were prevented from visiting an international gathering in Switzerland; their data was also taken. The same happened to a peace campaigner. It�셲 not just schedule 7 either. A 2009 report detailed the use of other anti-terror laws against protesters.
Britain has suffered deadly terrorist attacks this year that have cost the lives of dozens of people: children at a Manchester concert, revellers in Borough market, tourists on Westminster Bridge, and a worshipper at a mosque. Yes, there is an indisputable need for the police and security services to have the powers they need to prevent such acts. But it suits the government to deflect attention from having slashed 20,000 police jobs, and instead emphasise the need for ever more authoritarian legislation. After all, Theresa May denounced police officers who warned such cuts would put the country at risk as �쐁rying wolf�� and �쐓caremongering��. Yet Max Hill QC �� the current independent reviewer of terrorism legislation �� this week warned against the government�셲 �쐊neejerk reaction�� to recent attacks. Without �쐖ery careful work��, he said, plans to imprison those who repeatedly look up online terrorist content could mean innocent people being locked up. Is that scaremongering? Or does the experience of my sister underline that this is a very obvious risk?
Our rights and freedoms were won with huge sacrifice. Allowing the threat of terrorism to deprive citizens of basic human rights is dangerous. It also hands victories to terrorists who can quite rightly boast of changing our way of life and of widening divisions within our communities.
My sister�셲 case represents an attempt to intimidate a protester. Activists and innocent Britons from minority backgrounds are having their civil rights taken away from them. It is an affront to our democracy, and it must stop.
In time of conflict, people do awful things to each other.
The book Lost Lives set out just how terrible things were on these islands over more than three decades, with the name of each victim, who they were and the awful circumstances of their deaths. There are more than 3,600 deaths chronicled between 1966 and 1999.
Often the mass killings became synonymous with the places where they happened �� Dublin, Birmingham, Darkley, Greysteel, Brighton, Guildford, Deal, Monaghan, Shankill, Loughinisland, Warrington. We had Bloody Sunday and Bloody Friday, and many, many other bloody days throughout that period.
Then the peace process began, the killings subsided �� but didn�셳 stop �� and political leaders in these islands, in Europe and the United States brokered an uneasy peace.
Our joint peace process, sponsored and nurtured by our governments in Ireland and successive British governments, was dealt a severe blow when the people of Britain voted to leave the European Union. As a democrat, I respect the vote.
However the Irish peace process did not feature in the Brexit debate, except in Northern Ireland, where it was, naturally, a major issue. Elsewhere in the UK, it was simply lost in the noise generated by Brexiteers, with no thought among many of them about how leaving Europe would affect us over here on this island.
And so that leaves the question that hasn�셳 been answered yet: what will Brexit look like?
As a member of the Irish parliament (the D찼il) for County Donegal, a border county with a land boundary with the Northern Ireland counties of Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh, I can tell you what we don�셳 want.
There cannot be a return to any sort of physical border, no checkpoints, no technology, no cameras and no personnel. To introduce any of these measures is, in my opinion, a breach of the Good Friday agreement.
An all-Ireland referendum on 22 May 1998 enshrined the peace agreement in the legislation of both the UK and the Republic �� in Northern Ireland 71.1% voted yes; in the Republic 94.4% voted yes. An incredible 81% of people in the North went to the polls. The yearning for peace was overwhelming.
That yearning wasn�셳 just here in Ireland. It was also a deeply held ambition for the people of Britain, and that was recognised in the deal along three strands covering internal relations in Northern Ireland, relations between the Republic and the North and the relationship between the Republic and Britain.
We accept the Brexit vote. However, should the UK decide to also opt out of the single market and the EU�셲 customs union, it will be going against the spirit of the Good Friday agreement and narrows significantly how we can work together in the future.
The peace process has been punctured on numerous occasions, but every time it has bounced back and continued. The current lack of an administration in Northern Ireland is another puncture in what is a very fragile process.
Now Brexit threatens that, and our hard-won peace. Over the past 20 years communities once divided by checkpoints and terror have become whole again. Families, parishes and businesses have been reconnected. Our peace process has saved lives in ways we never imagined �� and includes initiatives such as the Irish government funding world-class cardiac and cancer care centres in Derry so that patients in Donegal can receive treatment there. Critically ill children from Northern Ireland can now be treated in Dublin.
Ireland�셲 peace process is also Britain�셲 peace process; it belongs to the people of the UK as much as to the people of Ireland. We have all benefited from it.
The British Irish Council (BIC) was established by the Good Friday agreement. At our meeting in Jersey recently, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, suggested the BIC forum would become even more important after Brexit.
Relationships within the BIC are good. The Queen�셲 state visit to Ireland in 2011 is still etched positively in the minds of Irish citizens; as is the first ever state visit to Britain by President Michael D Higgins three years later. Our journey to reconciliation is a good one.
Today the men of violence are fewer in number but terror groups on both sides in the North continue to exist, operate and plot murder. A return to the securitisation of the land border on our island will give these evil people the means needed to fund their sickening campaign.
All parties in the Good Friday agreement must continue to honour all elements of it, and its subsequent additions at Stormont House and St Andrew�셲 �� and that includes the free movement of people, without hindrance.
We�셶e come too far to go back.

The international terrorism threat to the UK has been raised to critical, meaning an attack is expected imminently, in the wake of the Parsons Green bomb attack in London. It is the highest of the five levels used to describe the threat.
Alongside the increased terror threat, phase one of Operation Temperer has been activated, meaning that up to 5,000 armed troops can be deployed at sensitive sites and events, transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release armed police for other policing duties.The plan was activated for the first time on 23 May after the Manchester Arena suicide bombing, when the prime minister said the police had asked for military support and the request had been approved by the defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon.It is the fourth time the assessment has been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced on 1 August 2006.
It was last at critical in the wake of the Manchester Arena attack. Before that it was raised for three days from 10 August 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot, and on 30 June 2007 when the security services uncovered the plot to bomb a nightclub on London�셲 Haymarket and an attempted car bombing at Glasgow airport.The threat level is agreed by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre based on available intelligence, terrorist capability, terrorist intention and timescale. It was established in June 2003 and is based at MI5�셲 London headquarters, comprising representatives from 16 government departments and agencies.
On top of the military presence, the Met assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK�셲 most senior counterterrorism officer, warned the measures �쐌ay mean disruption for those who are travelling. The public are asked to be patient and plan ahead, allowing time for delays.��
In total there are five threat levels, with critical the highest.
Police chiefs have warned witnesses to flee the scene of a terrorist attack rather than getting their smartphones out to take photos or record video.
Officers highlighted the recent episode at Parsons Green, where images of a partially exploded bomb on a tube train were posted online within minutes.
The warning forms part of a campaign aimed at ensuring children and teenagers know the key safety steps to follow if they are caught up in a terrorist incident.
In the first initiative of its kind, the UK�셲 counter-terrorism police network is also calling for the �쐒un, hide, tell�� message to be routinely taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.
Britain is facing an unprecedented threat after a wave of atrocities in 2017, including the Manchester bombing, in which a pop concert packed with young fans was targeted.
Met police deputy assistant commissioner Lucy D�셅rsi, the national policing lead for protective security, said: �쏻e appreciate that talking to young people about terrorism can be scary, for parents and children alike.
�쏝ut the atrocities in London and Manchester have sadly resulted in some of the youngest victims of terror this country has ever seen, and if we are able to teach children to act in a way which could potentially save their lives then it is our responsibility to do so.
�쏻e are particularly concerned when we see people �� young and old �� using their mobiles to film scenes when they should be moving away from the danger. The recent incident in Parsons Green is a good example of this.
�쏰ur research showed that many young people think filming would be a good thing to provide evidence for police. We must get them to understand that the priority must be their safety.��
Police have run a number of public information campaigns highlighting the main advice to follow if an attack happens. It states that people should run if they can, or if not hide, and then alert authorities of the danger only when it is safe to do so.
Now security experts have drawn up a version for children and teenagers �� including the instruction not to stop and use their phones until they are safely away from danger.
Police want to see the message taught in schools and colleges to 11 to 16-year-olds as part of the �쐁itizenship�� plank of the national curriculum. A �쐒un, hide, tell�� emoji has been created for the campaign, which is being supported by celebrities including TV adventurer Bear Grylls and England footballer Jamie Vardy.
Grylls said: �쏧�셶e tackled some of the most dangerous environments on earth, but in the event of a terrorist attack there is only one thing I would advise: run, hide, tell.��
The NSPCC said it had received 300 contacts from young people anxious about terrorism since April.
John Cameron, head of helplines at the charity, said: �쏛dults can help a child by listening to their worries, reassuring them these events are rare, and teaching them to run, hide, and tell.
�쏛lthough these conversations might be difficult, the spate of devastating events means that they cannot be brushed under the carpet and we all have a duty to help every child stay safe.��
The Catalan interior ministry has confirmed that it was warned by Belgian authorities in March 2016 about Abdelbaki Es Satty, the imam who radicalised and organised the terror cell that killed 15 people in north-east Spain last week.
Hans Bonte, the mayor of the Flemish town of Vilvoorde, said local security forces had emailed an official in the Catalan police to express disquiet about Es Satty.
The confirmation came as new CCTV images emerged of three of the suspects, which appeared to show them laughing at a petrol station hours before they were shot dead by police.
Almost all of the dead men and suspects in the 12-strong terror cell had been living in Ripoll, where Es Satty had been appointed as an imam two years ago, despite having served a prison sentence in Spain for drug smuggling. He spent the early months of last year in Vilvoorde.
�쏷he imam of Diegem [another Belgian town near Vilvoorde] asked about the man who had moved to Vilvoorde,�� Bonte told El Pa챠s. �쏦e said he acted strangely and told him he�셝 left Spain because he had no future there and had proclaimed himself imam, though he had no accreditation.��
Bonte said the Catalan official replied on the same day that Es Satty was �쐍ot known�� to authorities in Catalonia and had no known links to radical Islam, although a person with the same surname had been investigated.
The Catalan interior ministry confirmed the Belgian communication but emphasised that it was �쏿n informal contact�� between two people who had met at international conferences.
�쏧t wasn�셳 an official communication, which would arrive by other channels,�� said a spokeswoman for the ministry.
Anti-terrorist sources told El Pa챠s that the information had not been shared with either the Spanish interior ministry or with the Belgian federal police.
On Wednesday police said the terror cell had created a suicide vest packed with viable explosives and were in the process of making several more when a blast ripped through their bomb factory.
A search of the rubble at the factory in a disused house in Alcanar in southern Catalonia resulted in the discovery of the vest, which had gone unnoticed on Thursday last week when the blast was initially dismissed as an accidental gas explosion.
Police said on Thursday they had identified the remains of the last suspected member of the cell.
�쏽oussef Aallaa is the last corpse identified in the Alcanar explosion,�� Catalan regional police said. �쏷hat is the last known member of the cell�� whose remains had not been formally identified, they said.
Es Satty is also believed to have died in the explosion.
Questions are being asked about the Catalan police�셲 response to the blast, with sources close to the judicial investigation in Madrid suggesting they may have missed an opportunity to uncover the plot before the terrorists struck later that day in Barcelona.
Quoting two sources close to the investigation in Madrid, Reuters news agency said the missed opportunity may have been a result of procedural errors and a lack of communication.
No immediate decision was made to call explosives experts to the scene of the blast, nor was information about it passed to the national police or civil guard headquarters in Madrid, according to the source.
The group had been planning much larger attacks, but the blast forced the suspects to turn instead to using vehicles as weapons.
A Spanish high court judge ordered another one of the four suspects arrested over the twin attacks in Catalonia last week to be released on certain conditions, court sources told the Associated Press on Thursday.
The suspect, Salah el Karib, ran an internet cafe in Ripoll. Investigating judge Fernando Andreu had originally asked for him to remain in police custody pending further investigation of his possible role in the attacks.
However, the judge decided that there was not enough evidence to keep Karib in custody, the court source said. Karib will have to hand over his passport and check into court every week.
Another man arrested over the attacks, Mohammed Aallaa, was also released on certain conditions earlier this week while two others were remanded on charges of membership of a terrorist group and murder.
According to the Catalan newspaper Ara, which published the CCTV images, the three suspects that appear in the pictures were regulars at the petrol station and visited four times on the day of the attacks on Barcelona and Cambrils.
Omar Hychami, Houssaine Abouyaaquob and Moussa Oukabir bought bread, eggs and lighters, and appeared to joke with each other just hours before they were shot dead by police along with two other suspects, after driving a car into pedestrians in Cambrils.
Detectives are continuing to question two men, aged 18 and 21, arrested in connection with Friday�셲 London Underground attack as the government concluded a follow-up attack was not imminent and downgraded the UK terror threat assessment from critical to severe.
The home secretary, Amber Rudd, claimed �쐅ood progress�� had been made in the investigation following the rush hour incident on Friday morning which involved a crude bomb which failed to detonate properly but still resulted in injuries to 30 people at Parsons Green tube station.
Police searched three addresses in Surrey and west London on Sunday, one the home of a couple who fostered children and who were decorated by the Queen for their public service, the other believed to be the home of a 21-year-old man close to the perimeter road of Heathrow airport in Stanwell who was arrested late on Saturday. It was unclear what connection the third address had with the investigation.
Both men remain in police custody under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 which allows police to detain suspects without charge beyond the four days allowed for suspects connected to other crimes.
Police described the arrest of the 18-year-old in the departure area of the Port of Dover on Saturday morning as significant. Rudd said it appeared the bomber was not a lone wolf but it was �쐔oo early to reach any final conclusions on that��.
The foster home had recently hosted refugees from conflict zones, according to neighbours.
Scotland Yard declined to comment on the nationality of the arrested 18-year-old. The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, the national lead for counter-terrorism policing, said the investigation had proceeded at �쐆igh pace�� and it was becoming clear how the device, which was fitted with a timer, was made. Investigators do not believe the attacker was present when it exploded on a District line train heading for central London.
Rowley said on Sunday afternoon: �쏷here are now two searches continuing at addresses in Hounslow and Surrey and we are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the device. There is still much more to do but this greater clarity and this progress has led the joint terrorism analysis centre �� the independent body that assess threat �� to come to the judgement that an attack is no longer imminent.��
Meanwhile, CCTV images emerged appearing to show a person walking with a Lidl bag on the morning of Friday�셲 rush hour tube attack. The footage, acquired by ITV News, is reported to have been filmed near a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, which is at the centre of one of two police raids.
Images posted on social media after the Parsons Green attack showed wires protruding from a bucket on fire inside a plastic Lidl carrier bag on the floor of a train carriage.
Military personnel who were mobilised when the threat level was raised on Friday evening will return to normal duties, Rudd said, but she urged the public to �쐁ontinue to be vigilant but not be alarmed��.
She said there was no evidence that other explosive devices were in circulation, as had reportedly been claimed by representatives of Islamic State.
Rowley said the travelling public would still see a high level of policing, armed and unarmed, on Monday morning.
�쏮ilitary personnel will remain at readiness to deploy in support of the police should future security situations require,�� he said.
All but one of the 30 people hospitalised on Friday have been discharged. One patient remains at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, according to NHS England. The victimssuffered flash burns and injuries caused in the ensuing panic and stampede.
In Sunbury-on-Thames, where about 60 homes were temporarily evacuated on Saturday �쏿s a precaution�� while police investigated a suspected bomb factory at a foster home, neighbours told how foster carers Ronald and Penelope Jones, 88 and 71, had taken in up to 300 children during their career, including eight refugees, and had an 18-year-old staying with them recently.
Dave Solway, a 44-year-old builder who lives opposite the Jones family, said the couple had two children living with them, one of whom had been there �쏿 couple of years��.
Alison Griffiths, a local councillor, told the Guardian: �쏧 know Penny because she comes down to the shopping centre. She is a really lovely person. I was aware that there were two children in her care.��
The Joneses, who were made MBEs in 2010, are understood to be staying with friends and have been unavailable for comment.
Police scaled back the cordon around the property on Sunday and told residents there were no safety risks caused by the ongoing investigations. An inner cordon of 10 houses remained in place.
In Stanwell, residents said a 21-year old who was arrested in nearby Hounslow late on Saturday, kept late hours and worked in a job with a uniform, possibly security.
�쏦e has always been polite with us.�� said Pat Hodge, 59. �쏧 was up some nights from 11pm and he would be coming home and friends would knock on the door between 2 and 3am. You would see people in there looking like they were playing a games console. They used to sit out in the garden and smoke shisha.��
The attack renewed focus on the government�셲 counter-radicalisation strategy. The Home Office launched a recruitment campaign on Sunday to find the head of a new counter-extremism commission intended to help train staff at schools and colleges to spot signs that youngsters were being radicalised.
Rudd said it would �쐇dentify and challenge tolerance of extremism, tackle extremist ideology and promote British values, learning the lessons from the struggle against racism in the 20th century��.
Meanwhile, Theresa May said the government was talking to internet companies such as Google and Facebook about �쐂oing more�� to tackle extremism online and said she would raise the issue at the UN general assembly this week.
�쏰ne of the issues that we really need to be addressing, and I�셪l be raising this when I�셫 at the UN, is the question of the use of the internet by terrorists for terrorist planning,�� the prime minister said. �쏝ut also this using it for the spread of extremism, of hatred, of propaganda that can incite and can inspire terrorism.��
A man arrested in the Netherlands early on Thursday morning is suspected of preparing a �쐔errorist attack�� on a concert by an American rock band, Dutch police have said.
Police detained the 22-year-old in Brabant province, south of Rotterdam, after an alert from Spanish colleagues. The Spanish warning led to the cancellation of a performance on Wednesday night by Los Angeles band Allah-Las.�쏷he suspicion is that the suspect is involved in the preparation of a terrorist attack,�� the Rotterdam police chief, Frank Paauw, said.
�쏷here is no terror threat now any more,�� he added. �쏷here is no threat because we have arrested a suspect and the information about the threat was so specific on the location of the event that, with that arrest, we can conclude that the threat is gone.��
The venue, a former grain silo called Maassilo that can accommodate 5,000 people, was evacuated at 7pm, just half an hour before the band were due on stage, with organisers citing an �쐕nspecified threat��.
Police searched the man�셲 home after his arrest but released no details of anything they found. His identity was not released, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines.
The 22-year-old man was being questioned to determine exactly what his role was in the threat, police spokeswoman Svetlana Westermeijer said. No charges had been filed yet.
If authorities want to prolong the suspect�셲 detention they will have to arraign him at a closed-doors hearing with an investigative judge before the end of Friday, prosecution spokeswoman Jeichien de Graaff said.
The man lives in the small town of Zevenbergen, which is 30 miles (50km) south of Rotterdam. Neighbours told Dutch TV the suspect was �쏿 quiet man�� who lived with his parents, who are currently on holiday.
Sources told Dutch radio the man had been arrested after �쐌aking threatening statements�� over the messaging app Telegram, which has been used by Islamic State to spread its propaganda.
Meanwhile, a Spanish mechanic who was detained on Wednesday night was largely ruled out of the investigation.
The man, a repairman, had been driving, apparently drunk, close to the Maassilo venue.
A check of his van by explosives experts found nothing suspicious beyond five gas canisters, and officers searching his home �쐕ncovered no link with the terror threat ... at the Maassilo,�� police said.
Spanish authorities had already said it was unlikely there was any connection between the van driver and the attacks in north-eastern Spain.
The Dutch counter-terror coordinator, Dick Schoof, commended the police action on Twitter, saying it was �쏿lert, appropriate for the current threat level��.
Schoof left the country�셲 threat level unchanged at �쐓ubstantial��, the fourth step of a five-level scale.
It was not clear what the exact nature of the threat to the concert was, or if the band�셲 name played any role in the threat.
In an interview with the Guardian last year, band members said they had chosen the word Allah, Arabic for God, because they were seeking a �쐆oly sounding�� name and had not realised it might cause offence.
�쏻e get emails from Muslims, here in the US and around the world, saying they�셱e offended, but that absolutely wasn�셳 our intention,�� said the lead singer, Miles Michaud. �쏻e email back and explain why we chose the name and mainly they understand.��
Police in Warsaw, Poland, said security was being beefed up for the band�셲 performance there on Thursday night.
Robert Szumiata of Warsaw police told Associated Press they had no information of any threat to the concert to be held at the downtown Niebo, or Heaven, club.
Still, he said that uniformed and plainclothes police would be deployed at and around the concert site in order to �쐃nsure security of people taking part in the concert and those who will find themselves in the area��.
Spain, already on high alert following last week�셲 deadly attacks in and near Barcelona, played a key role in the events of Wednesday and Thursday.
A Spanish counter-terrorism official said Spain�셲 civil guard received �쏿n alert indicating the possibility of an attack in a concert that was going to take place in Rotterdam��.
Britain�셲 terror threat level has been raised from severe to critical, indicating a further attack may be imminent following the Parsons Green tube bombing, Theresa May has said.
The hunt is under way for the bomber who attempted to bring carnage to a London rush-hour tube train packed with schoolchildren and commuters.
Twenty-nine people including a young boy were injured when the bomb partially detonated and sent a ball of fire along a carriage of a District line train at Parsons Green, west London.
Police are understood to have found CCTV images that captured the bomber as he boarded the train with the bomb packed in a white plastic bucket inside a Lidl supermarket bag. The train is believed to have had onboard CCTV, and there are a large number of cameras covering the network.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blast, the militant group�셲 Amaq news agency said on Friday evening.
Nobody suffered life-threatening injuries in the incident, the fifth terrorist attack Britain has suffered in less than six months. Parsons Green station has since reopened.
In a televised statement on Friday night, the prime minister said the UK terror threat level was being raised to its highest rating and that armed police and members of the military would be seen on the streets in the coming days.�쏤or this period, military personnel will replace police officers on guard duties at certain protected sites that are not accessible to the public,�� she said.�쏷he public will see more armed police on the transport network and on our streets, providing extra protection. This is a proportionate and sensible step which will provide extra reassurance and protection while the investigation progresses.��
The prime minister condemned Friday�셲 bombing as cowardly and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, denounced it as �쐁allous and indiscriminate��. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, described the attack as hideous and added: �쏻e will never be defeated.��
The security minister Ben Wallace told the BBC on Saturday: �쏻e haven�셳 been able at the moment to catch the bomber. The bomber is still out there �� or bombers �� and we have to get to the bottom of that and follow up the leads.��
The Met assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK�셲 most senior anti-terror police officer, said police were �쐁hasing down suspects��. He said support from the military would free up about 1,000 extra armed police officers, largely from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence police.
A former army bomb disposal officer said it appeared the initiating charge of the device had exploded but had failed to detonate the main charge.
Initially, police considered the possibility that the bomber had been among those taken to hospital, where many were treated for flash burns.
Investigators. however, believe the device was remotely detonated, which suggested it may not have been intended as a suicide attack, and that the bomber may have left the train before the explosion.
Donald Trump�셲 first response to the attack �� a tweet in which he claimed the �쐋oser terrorist�� had been on Scotland Yard�셲 radar, and that more proactive policing was required �� was dismissed by a police spokesman as �쐕nhelpful��. May also criticised the US president, saying: �쏧 never think it is helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.��
The explosion happened at about 8.20am on Friday while the train was stationary and the doors open.
Rory Rigney had just boarded the rear carriage of the train and was standing just feet away when the blast went off. �쏧 thought: �쁃id someone smash something?�� It sounded like a smash, then I heard a scream and thought: �쁈t�셲 someone having a fight.�� Then I saw the fireball coming towards me �� yellow or orange. My face still feels warm.
�쏷he doors were still open, so I jumped out and tried to get as far away as possible, got on the ground and covered myself. I wasn�셳 hanging around to get a better look at it.��
Chris Wildish, who was also on the train, said �쏿 massive flash of flames�� reached up to the ceiling of the train, and then the air was filled with the smell of chemicals. Many of the passengers were schoolchildren, who were knocked around by people trying to get away from the fire, he said.
Emma Stevie said people tumbled over each other as they tried to escape. �쏷here were people on top of people. There was a pregnant lady under me shouting: �쁈�셫 pregnant��. There was a little boy in his red and black uniform, he must have been about eight years old, a tiny thing, with his face smashed into the steps.��
Before long, a number of people returned to the train to retrieve bags and telephones. A few took photographs of the smouldering remains of the device, which had been packed into a bucket that eyewitnesses said appeared to have held mayonnaise. A number of wires, which appeared to be attached to small lights, were also visible.
Tube staff then ordered people to leave the station. Armed police were on the scene within minutes, as were firefighters and paramedics, who began treating people with burns.
Police threw a cordon around the area and asked some residents to leave their homes. Armed police evacuated a nursery and a junior school, and a girls�� secondary school was placed in lockdown.
NHS England said 29 patients had been treated, with 21 still in hospital on Friday evening.
Responsibility for the investigation was quickly handed to Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command.
Rowley said hundreds of detectives had been drafted in to the investigation, and he appealed to the public for information.
So far, 77 images and videos have been sent to investigators via the UK Police Image Appeal website.
On Friday night detectives were examining a mass of CCTV footage from the underground rail network, and from businesses around some District line stations.
The device was being examined by forensics experts, and may offer clues from its construction and from the chemicals used to make the explosive charge.
Counter-terrorism investigators will want to establish where the device was put together, and where the materials to make it were acquired. They will also be attempting to establish whether the bomb-making knowledge was acquired from the plethora of DIY guides on the internet, or from another person.
Rita Katz, the director of the private intelligence company Site, said Isis claimed the bombing was the work of a �쐂etachment�� rather than simply a �쐓oldier��, which she said implied it was a co-ordinated attack.The terror group has frequently declared that it was behind terrorist incidents in recent years but experts have warned that its claims should be treated with caution.
The explosion at Parsons Green is the first terrorist attack in the UK this year to not result in loss of life. Two vehicle and knife attacks in London and a bombing in Manchester were blamed on Islamist-motivated terrorism. A van attack in June was blamed on an extreme rightwing motivation.
Hans Michels, a professor of safety engineering at the chemical engineering department at Imperial College London, said there appeared to be similarities with the failed attempts on 21 July 2005 to bomb the tube network.
�쏧n appearance and arrangement the remnants of the device seem highly similar to those of the hydrogen peroxide-based devices of 2005. The size of the device and its containment in a plastic bucket is also the same.��
The trial of the 21 July bombers heard that their devices had failed because they had made mistakes when mixing the chemicals.
Fourteen people have been confirmed killed in two attacks in Spain on Thursday. Thirteen died when a van was driven in to crowds on Las Ramblas in Barcelona, and one person was killed by a car in Cambrils, a coastal town 75 miles to the the south. The horrific events appear to have begun the night before, in another town 120 miles south of Barcelona. Here is what we know at midday BST on Friday:
The number of people arrested for terrorism-linked offences rose 68% to a record 379 in the 12 months to June, one of the most intense periods for terrorist attacks in recent history.
The Home Office said it was the highest number of terrorist arrests in a year since records began in 2001. They included 12 arrests linked to the Westminster attack in March, 23 connected with the Manchester Arena bombing in May, 21 arrests following the London Bridge attack in June and one in relation to the Finsbury Park van attack soon after.
The Home Office quarterly bulletin on the police�셲 use of their counter-terrorism powers says 123 of those arrested were charged �� 105 with terrorism offences �� and 189 were released without charge. The rest were either bailed pending further investigation or faced alternative action.
So far, 32 of the 105 charged with terrorist offences have been prosecuted and found guilty and 68 are awaiting prosecution.
The number of terrorist prisoners in British jails has also risen in the past year, by 35% to 204. The Home Office said 91% of those in prison on 30 June held extreme Islamist views and a further 5% had far-right ideologies.
Police use of stop and search powers under the counter-terrorism laws rose by 17%, from 552 stops to 646. But the proportion of people arrested as a result of stops fell from 12% in the previous year to 8% this year.
The deputy assistant commissionerand senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, Neil Basu, said six terrorist plots had been prevented since the Westminster attack in March.
�쏷here is no doubt that since March and following the attacks in London and Manchester we have seen a shift-change in momentum. But while the terrorist threat has increased in recent months, so has our activity, reflected by this significant increase in arrests.
�쏻e�셱e taking every possible opportunity to disrupt terrorist activity �� be it making arrests for terrorism offences, intervening where there are signs of radicalisation, or working with communities to prevent terrorists operating in their area,�� he said.
�쏱olice, together with the security services are determined to make the UK as hostile an environment for terrorists as possible.��
The figures show there have been 19 terrorist plots foiled in the UK by police and the UK intelligence community since June 2013. A broad spectrum of people have been arrested in connection with terrorism investigations in terms of age, gender and ethnicity.
�쏷hese figures show that there is no such thing as a �쁳ypical�� terrorist,�� Basu said.
�쏻e�셱e seeing young and old; women and men; all from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds and communities. It�셲 therefore important that members of the public remain vigilant in all situations, and report any suspicious activity to police.��

On a sunny day, on a crowded urban street, a heavy van leaps suddenly onto the sideway. It accelerates. It kills and injures dozens. Or an improvised bomb explodes on public transport, injuring many. A perpetrator, apprehended quickly due to CCTV footage, professes allegiance to Isis but claims to have acted alone.A version of this awful scene was replayed in Barcelona and just days ago in London �� but what if it were to happen in the US? How would its government respond?
One way of making a prediction is by looking at the Trump administration�셲 responses to other dramatic threats.Consider its responses to Syria, North Korea, and Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. All share three common traits: they have been calibrated with an eye for drama, with no attention to ensuring enduring change and with scant regard for harmful collateral damage.If this form is maintained, a response to domestic terrorism is likely to do more harm than good.
Syrian policy is exemplary. In April, Trump abruptly reversed a hands-off policy by launching Tomahawk missiles in response to the Assad regime�셲 use of chemical weapon. Yet today, by the president�셲 own admission, the US has �쐋ittle to do�� with Syria. His dramatic April strike has had little effect beyond its literal impact.
When North Korea accelerated its missile tests, the Trump administration responded with fiery bluster that has singularly failed to elicit a greater alignment of Chinese and Russian behavior. To the contrary, its threats of a trade war seem to be fraying US relations with South Korea �� ironically, creating political space for North Korea to maneuver between enemies.
After Hurricane Harvey, Trump seized the Texas town of Annaville as a stage to brag about his own historical manifest destiny, and, predictably, the crowds he draws. Not a peep from the administration, though, came of the catastrophic failure of urban planning that led to tragedy in Houston, how federal flood insurance elicited dangerous over-construction, or (heaven forbid) the possible role of climate change.
Despite a patina of toughness, the predicable beats of Trump�셲 crisis responses make the US a more, not less, vulnerable terrorism target.An attack on US interests will likely provoke familiar high-octane rhetoric. Terrorists, however, thrive when their enemies treat them as mightier than they are. Eying the prospect of a propaganda coup, they likely take a US attack to have higher returns than normal.
And because the administration evaluates its responses using an ideological rather than an empirical lens, those reactions are unlikely to target accurately the sources of violent risk. The ongoing dissolution of Isis�셲 territorial control robs the administration of the most grandiose targets. Suspects closer to home are more likely to feel the brunt of its dramatic, even theatrical reactions.
The rollout of the first travel ban in late January provides some taste of what this might look like. That measure was installed without warning. It initially applied not only to immigrants but also legal residents of the United States.As I saw as a legal observer at O�섽are Airport, this operated in effect as a subtle kind of ethnic cleansing by excluding certain non-residents. While the travel ban has since been narrowed to apply only to visa holders, its initial application shows how the right of movement can quickly be extinguished, trapping or excluding minority populations.
If responses are selected for their dramatic flair, we can securely expect a reenactment of the 9/11 aftermath, perhaps inflected by a borrowing of extreme measures invented in other nations. The FBI�셲 �쁏ENTTBOM�� entailed aggressive use of immigration law to detain hundreds of suspects, often based on ethnicity or perceived faith. Arab and Muslim communities were swept with �쁵oluntary�� interviews that at times resulted in arrests on insubstantial premises.
But large-scale arrests, while terrifying to the communities involved, may well not be as dramatic as the administration wishes. Expect, therefore, for the White House to take a leaf from the French emergency-powers book by closing dozens of mosques and deporting imams. Talk of registers for Muslims will inevitably seethe into the president�셲 daily ration of Fox News talking heads.
Finally, the Trump administration has pointedly failed to continue Obama�셲 efforts to close the Guantanamo prison, and has yet to follow Obama�셲 example of eschewing the use of military detention in the US.Rather, it seems quite likely that longstanding American traditions of criminal trials before independent judges will be sacrificed for another quick political hit.
And yet, will any of this do much good for security? Like the administration�셲 responses to Syria, North Korea, and Hurricane Harvey, all this is unlikely to impinge on Isis�셲 ability to recruit via social media. To the contrary, it will likely stoke the private animus and hatred that in the European context has made migrant communities more fertile recruiting grounds.
The US will be one step closer to a vicious circle in which its government elicits violent responses upon which that government thrives politics. It will be one step closer to abandoning the best of its democratic and constitutional heritage.
Spanish police investigating the Barcelona terrorist attack are hunting an 18-year-old man who is suspected of driving the van that ploughed through Las Ramblas on Thursday, killing at least 13 people and injuring more than 100.
Police sources told Spanish media they were looking for Moussa Oukabir, the younger brother of Driss Oukabir, who was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of hiring the van used in the attack. Driss Oukabir has denied involvement and is reported to have told police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to obtain the vehicle.
Four suspects �� three Moroccans and one Spaniard �� have been arrested in connection with the Barcelona attack, local police chief Josep Llu챠s Trapero said on Friday. None had any record of terrorist activity, he added.
Catalan police reportedly believe Moussa Oukabir fled the scene of the attack in Las Ramblas and is still on the run. A spokeswoman for the force, the Mossos d�섷squadra, said officers were not officially naming any suspects as they continued their inquiries. She said official updates would continue to appear on the force�셲 Twitter account.
Little is known about Moussa Oukabir, who is thought to have turned 18 very recently. However, attention has already focused on comments he made on the social media site Kiwi.
Asked what he would do on his first day if he became absolute ruler of the world, he replied: �쏫ill the unbelievers and leave only Muslims who follow their religion.�� Asked in which country he would never contemplate living, he answered: �쏷he Vatican.��
Hours after the Barcelona attack, five suspected terrorists were shot dead by Spanish police in the coastal town of Cambrils after they drove into pedestrians early on Friday morning, as part of the country�셲 second terror attack in 24 hours.
One person was killed in the attack, which left five other bystanders and a police officer injured. Some of the suspects wore what appeared to be explosive belts, which were later found to be fake.
Jordi Munell, the mayor of Ripoll, where both brothers lived, said the town was in a state of shock following the events of Thursday and Friday. �쏻e know the police are looking for [Moussa Oukabir] but we don�셳 know if he�셲 among the people who�셶e been arrested,�� he said.
�쏷he police have been checking all the homes connected with the family today. People here are just really surprised. Ripoll is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody else. We don�셳 understand how people we�셶e been living side-by-side with could be involved in terrorism and nor do their families. These are people that people have been to school with and played football with.��
Police believe the attacks in Las Ramblas and Cambrils are linked to an explosion earlier this week at a house in the small town of Alcanar, 120 miles south of Barcelona, that left one person dead and 16 injured.
Police and firefighters who came to the scene were wounded by a second blast. The Alcanar explosions were initially reported to have been caused by gas cylinders but Trapero later said those in the house were attempting to �쐏repare an explosive device��.
Speaking at a press conference on Friday afternoon, Trapero said the driver of the Las Ramblas van was yet to be identified, but could be among the five terrorists shot dead in Cambrils. He also revealed that the terror cell had planned at least two attacks in a house in Alacanar.
�쏻e�셱e working on the hypothesis that the authors [of the attacks] had been planning them both for a while in the building in Alcanar, but we can�셳 join up all the scenarios,�� he said. �쏧t was a group �� we don�셳 have a concrete number �� but we�셱e not discounting the idea that they were planning other attacks.��
The attack in Cambrils concluded a day of violence along the Catalan coast, which the police said was the work of a terrorist cell determined to �쐊ill as many people as possible��.
Video footage from Cambrils showed three bodies on the ground in the town�셲 port. The police urged residents to stay indoors and later carried out controlled blasts on suspected explosive devices.
Fitzroy Davies, from Wolverhampton, was caught up in the second attack in Cambrils and saw one of the attackers being shot by police. He told the BBC that he had seen people running into the bar where he was as the assault unfolded.
�쏷his guy came running up the road and was shouting something. I didn�셳 know what it was, so we said, �쁟all the police,�쇺�� he said. �쏻ithin 30 seconds the police were already there, jumped out of the car, started shouting at the guy; the guy was then saying something else again. And then they �� �쁯op, pop�� �� did a couple of shots and he fell down.
�쏦e stood back up and then he stepped over the fence and he started, he was taunting, smiling and he carried on walking to the police, and then they gave it to him again, a couple more shots and then he fell to the ground.��
Trapero said one officer had managed to kill all but one of the attackers. He said that it was not easy for the officer involved, despite being a professional.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Las Ramblas attack, saying on a website: �쏷error is filling the crusaders�� hearts in the land of Andalusia.�� The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said the whole country stood in solidarity with Barcelona, blaming �쐉ihadi terrorism��.
Javier Zaragoza, the chief prosecutor of the Audiencia Nacional, which deals with terrorism cases, said the attackers did not appear to have previous links to jihadism.
�쏛s far as we know, there was no previous investigation that might have identified them,�� he told the Cadena Ser radio station. �쏾ero risk doesn�셳 exist when it comes to these things. The anti-terror police services have done really good work for years and various attacks have been prevented.��
At midday local time, thousands of people gathered in Barcelona�셲 main square for a minute�셲 silence to remember the dead. Among those in attendance were King Felipe of Spain, Rajoy, Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan regional president, and Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona.
At the end of the minute�셲 silence, the crowd broke into applause and chanted �쏯o tinc por�� (�쏧 am not afraid��).
Meanwhile the mayor of the French city of Nice, where dozens were mown down a year ago by an attacker driving a truck, has said he will meet his European counterparts next month to see how they can improve security in the aftermath of the Barcelona attack.
Eighty-six people were killed in the jihadist attack in the French Riviera city, the first of several similar incidents in Europe.
�쏧 am convinced that life will prevail over death and that we will triumph over barbarism and terror,�� Christian Estrosi told reporters after honouring Barcelona�셲 victims on the Promenade des Anglais where dozens died on Bastille Day last year.
Donald Trump�셲 immediate suggestion that the terrorist who left a bomb on the London Underground on Friday was in Scotland Yard�셲 sights was unhelpful and �쐏ure speculation��, according to Britain�셲 home secretary.
�쏧t is never helpful to have speculation about an ongoing operation and I would include the president of the United States in that comment,�� said Amber Rudd, who said the tweet was not based on intelligence.
�쏧t is pure speculation,�� she told BBC1�셲 The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.
Asked if her message to the US president was �쏡onald, just put your phone down and stop tweeting��, the home secretary said: �쏧 don�셳 think I�셝 be the first person to say that, would I? We don�셳 want any speculation on an ongoing operation.��
Her comments came after Trump caused anger in London with his tweet, sent soon after the incident.
He also used the attack to promote his controversial policy to ban people coming to the US from six Muslim-majority countries.
Rudd�셲 intervention followed a rebuke from the prime minister, Theresa May, who said it was never helpful for anyone to speculate on an ongoing investigation.
Rudd went further by naming the US president as she set out the latest developments following the attack. She said there was no evidence as yet to link it to Islamic State.
She suggested that Trump�셲 intervention was different to the US intelligence leaks to the media after the Manchester bombing, which caused anger within the government.
�쏰ur particular complaint was an outrageous leak of material following the Manchester inquiry. That was shut down, it didn�셳 happen again,�� she said, adding that the relationship with the US security services was very important to the UK.
Rudd said a key focus was to ensure that there was less material available to radicalise young people.
She accepted there had been a cut of 24,000 in police numbers during the previous Conservative government, but said that crime had fallen during that period.
She said she used every meeting of the government�셲 emergency Cobra committee, including one she chaired this weekend, to ask police leaders if they had adequate resources. �쏷hey say they have,�� she said.
Amateur footage appears to capture the moment officers shoot at a terror suspect in the coastal town of Cambrils on Thursday night. The man is knocked to the ground but stands up again. He is wearing what looks like an explosive vest, which later turned out to be fake. A total of five suspects were shot dead by police during the incident
It�셲 10 years since I found myself in the middle of the Glasgow Airport terror attack. It was 30 June 2007. I was at the airport, picking up my brother, sister-in-law and niece from holiday. As I walked through the terminal, I noticed people being ushered out the way I�셝 come in. I wasn�셳 sure what was going on �� there was no panic �� but I thought that if something had happened, I wasn�셳 leaving without my family.
I carried on walking in the opposite direction to everyone else. By the time I got to the doors at the other end, I was on my own. I walked outside, and that�셲 when I saw a burning jeep crashed into the building. There was a guy lying next to it engulfed in flames, a couple of police officers, and parts of the road were on fire, too.
At first, I thought it had been an accident. A police officer used a fire extinguisher on the burning guy, then they turned away. I thought he was dead, and maybe they did, too. It was when he got up that I realised he was an attacker. It was eerie �� he didn�셳 even groan as he stood; it was as if being on fire hadn�셳 affected him. I learned later he was on morphine.
He tried to get to the jeep�셲 boot �� apparently, it was full of petrol bombs. The police were trying to stop him, but he kept kicking at their legs. As they fought, they moved towards me. One of the officers used pepper spray, and my eyes were streaming. The next time I opened them, this lunatic was coming in my direction.
When you�셱e involved in something like that, it�셲 hard to remember afterwards exactly how it went. You just act on instinct. My partner, Gillian, had recently passed away, after battling cancer. I had watched her fight like hell to survive, and these characters were trying to take people�셲 lives as if they meant nothing. It enraged me, as did having pepper spray in my eyes, to be honest. So I went for him.
As soon as I hit him, I knew that he was going down. I don�셳 mean to sound blas챕. He�셝 been doing these commando-style moves to fight off the police, and he seemed well trained, but I grew up in Glasgow: it seemed natural to me that a wee forearm smash would sort it out. I�셫 not a street fighter, but I know how to look after myself.
I threw my full weight into it. My arm and shoulder met his chest and he clattered down. I stood on his legs while the police cuffed him. One officer shouted at me, �쏻ho are you? Get out of here.�� That annoyed me. Who am I? I�셫 the one who�셲 just put him on his backside.
By that time, a second terrorist was out of the car, but the police had the situation under control, so I retreated.
They interviewed me on BBC afterwards, but I didn�셳 want a fuss; it was what any half-decent person would have done. When I heard that the guy had later died in hospital, I didn�셳 really feel anything. It made no difference to me whether he was dead or in jail, like the other man.
I wasn�셳 the only one to help out. A taxi driver, Alex McIlveen, and a baggage handler, John Smeaton, were both on the scene before me, as were a couple of others. They got some kicks in on the terrorists and helped put out the burning jeep. John did a few interviews, and that famous thing he said �� �쏷his is Glasgow, we�셪l set about you�� �� was just right. It showed Scottish resilience and humour.
I�셫 a builder, and went back to work the next day. I�셶e honestly never lost a moment�셲 sleep over what happened.
I got a couple of awards, including the Queen�셲 Gallantry Medal. I met the prime minister, Gordon Brown, too. He said, �쏷hanks for everything.�� I said, �쏯ae problem.��
Probably the biggest buzz came a few months later. I saw a horse called Secret Hero. I was looking at the name, thinking I�셝 seen it before, and I remembered that�셲 what the Daily Record had called me in a headline. I stuck 짙125 on it, it won and I took home 짙500. It felt like a nice ending.

A follower of Islamic State who was fascinated by the group�셲 ideology plotted to launch a terrorist attack on a wide range of possible targets including the Queen�셲 Guard, parliament and media organisations, a court has heard.
Umar Haque, 25, from east London, enlisted the help of others at his mosque, where he also tried to groom children with role-playing and videos of beheadings.
Haque, a religious teacher at an Islamic school, is accused of plotting terrorist attacks, while Abuthaher Mamun, 19, Muhammad Abid, 27, and Nadeem Patel, 26, are accused of helping Haque.
During the opening of the trial of the four men, the prosecutor, Mark Heywood QC, told the jury that Haque had determined in 2016 and early 2017 to carry out one or more violent attacks with others in the UK.
�쏦is motivation was just that same motivation that drives the banned Islamic State group and at its heart had religious, political motivations,�� Heywood told the court.
�쏦aque had developed an extreme mindset, he was then prepared to contemplate and was capable of justifying acts of extreme violence in pursuit of the cause, the cause he had come wholeheartedly to believe in. He had clearly begun to turn his mind to the commission of violent terrorist acts here in the UK.��
Haque was �쐄ascinated�� by the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge on 22 March last year, the court heard. Heywood told the jury that covert recordings between Haque and one of his co-accused four days after that atrocity revealed his intentions to attack targets in London.
In one conversation, Heywood said, Haque was recorded saying: �쏶o what I want to personally is launch different attacks in all the different areas, one in Westminster, one in Stratford, one in Forest Gate, one �� in so many different areas, yeah.
�쏧mmediately there�셲 one focus to all the police. Get off the streets. Civilians get off the streets. London will be, not just Westminster attack, entire London �� We�셱e here to cause terror, my brother. We are a death squad sent by Allah and his messengers to avenge my Arab brothers�� blood.��
Among his targets were the Queen�셲 Guard, courts, Transport for London, parliament, Shia Muslims, Westfield shopping centre, Big Ben, the English Defence League or Britain First, foreign embassies, and radio stations or other media outlets, the court heard.
�쏮r Haque was fascinated by the warped and extreme ideology of Islamic State,�� Heywood told the jury. �쏛s he later told police after his arrest, he was their loyal follower.��
Haque tried to recruit children aged about 11 to 14 to his cause, the court heard. �쏦is methods were to expose them to information and video recordings and even to have them enact scenarios of violent action against police and others,�� Heywood told the jury.
Haque taught children aged between 11 and 16 at the Lantern of Knowledge Islamic School in Leyton, east London, between September 2015 and September 2016. He showed his pupils images of guns, burning passports and beheadings with a knife or sword to �쐃ncourage them into his mindset��, Heywood said.
The images included one of a dead boy, and Haque told pupils they would meet the same fate if they did not join and promise to become a martyr, the court heard.
He allegedly made the children do �쐏ush-ups, races and grappling�� and act out the roles of police and attackers in scenarios with weapons and a car bomb while he shouted �쏛llahu Akhbar��.
Haque and Mamun are both accused of preparing acts of terrorism between 25 March and 18 May 2017. Haque is also accused of researching and planning a terrorist attack, while Mamun allegedly traded in options in order to finance it.
Haque is further charged with preparing terrorist acts by leading exercises in physical training and role play with children at the Ripple Road mosque. He is also accused of dissemination of terrorist publications.
Abid is accused of having information about Haque�셲 plans and Patel is charged with plotting with Haque to possess a firearm or imitation firearm.
The defendants, who all live in east London, have denied these charges.
Haque has admitted charges of collection of terrorist information and dissemination of a terrorist publication, while Patel has admitted possessing a prohibited weapon.
The apparent terrorist attack in Barcelona underlines three harsh lessons learned by security services �� and the general public �� over recent months and years.
The first is that the use of vehicles as weapons is now an established tactic by extremists, one of the dozen or so employed in the last two decades that should be considered a standard part of the terrorist arsenal. In the last 13 months there have been similar attacks in France, Germany, Sweden and the UK.
A woman was killed by a car driven at speed by a rightwing extremist in the US last week in slightly different circumstances.
The precise motivation and the identity of the Barcelona attackers will become clear in the next few hours. Islamic State has claimed responsibility on its Amaq news agency, though in recent months such claims have become highly unreliable.
Individuals close to Isis and active on social media have been celebrating the attack, but this does not necessarily indicate a direct connection between the attacker or attackers and the group.
Tactics spread among militants when they are seen to work. There is no skill needed to drive a vehicle into a crowd, nor any difficulty involved in obtaining one. This makes a car, van or lorry an ideal weapon for today�셲 terrorists, who are often inspired by a group but are not actually part of it, and for the most part, lack the training and means necessary for more complex attacks.
The second lesson is that there is now little discrimination in targeting. This means tourists are very much in the line of fire. A decade or so ago, Islamic militant groups sought to send specific messages through their violence. Random attacks against unarmed civilians were seen as ineffective, and even counter-productive in terms of garnering public support in the Muslim world. The 9/11 attack was launched against targets seen by al-Qaida as symbols of US economic, political and military power.
In 2004, Spain was the target of the bloodiest jihadi attack on European soil when commuter trains were bombed by al-Qaida sympathisers in Madrid. One aim was to undermine Spanish support for military intervention in Iraq, and influence an election. Spain was also a particular target because of the historic resonance for militants of the Islamic kingdom of Andalusia, lost to Christendom 900 years ago.
This has changed. Isis has led a broader shift towards attacking anyone, anywhere, anyhow. Public spaces, always inherently vulnerable, are now more at risk than ever. Music fans in Manchester, summer revellers in Nice, pub-goers in London, and of course tourists, whether taking pictures on Westminster Bridge, on a beach in Tunisia, or on an airplane returning to Russia from Egypt.
Western holidaymakers overseas were targeted long ago. In 1997 there was a bloody attack in Luxor by Egyptian militants. But tourists were never a principal focus of violence. Now, they appear to be. Anyone driving a van on to the central pedestrianised concourse in Las Ramblas, one of the most crowded tourist zones in the world, was trying to kill foreign travellers.Spanish authorities were aware of the threat, and at Christmas sought to reinforce the protection of public spaces. One plot to use a truck against pedestrians was thwarted in November. Bollards, concrete blocks and other defences were considered. Intelligence gathering was increased.
But there is little that can be done in a hugely popular Mediterranean port city to guard against such an attack, and the third lesson is that good policing can keep you safe only for so long.
French intelligence services, in part due to their experience of fighting Islamist militancy in the 1990s, were well ahead of their UK or US counterparts for a decade or so. But by 2012, French spies, under-resourced and undermined by poor national and Europe-wide intelligence sharing, were struggling to contain the threat. They were ill-equipped to face the offensive launched in 2014 by Isis against their country from its newly won enclaves in Syria and Iraq.
The same may be true for Spanish services, which are much admired for their professionalism in the counter-terrorism world. Spain invested heavily in intelligence agencies after the 2004 attacks, building up a formidable capability for gathering information and acting on it. This has kept the country safe from Islamist terrorism for 13 years. Major plots were broken up in 2008. This year two more networks have been uncovered, including at least one with connections to Isis-led attackers elsewhere in Europe.
As Britons discovered this year, just because there are no successful attacks does not mean there�셲 no Islamist militancy. So the final harsh lesson is that something, or someone, will get through eventually.
Eighty-six people were killed and 434 injured after a 19-tonne truck was driven into crowds on Bastille Day. The driver was shot dead.
A truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market, leaving 12 dead. The attacker was killed four days later.
Briton Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing three. He then fatally stabbed a policeman before being shot dead by police. A fifth person died later.
Four people died and 15 were injured after a truck was driven into pedestrians on a busy shopping street.
Three attackers struck pedestrians with a van on London Bridge and went on a stabbing spree in the Borough Market area. Eight people died before the assailants were shot dead.
A van was driven into Muslims gathered near a Finsbury Park mosque, injuring 11 people. A man who had earlier collapsed and was having first aid died. Darren Osborne, 47, was charged with terrorism-related murder.

A car was driven into soldiers outside a barracks, injuring six. The driver was shot and wounded.
Tarik Kafala, the head of BBC Arabic, prefers to avoid the word �쐔errorist��. He�셲 avoided it in coverage of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, saying it is a �쐋oaded�� term. Cue outrage: from Norman Tebbit, a victim of the Brighton bombing, and historian Anthony Glees, who said the executive �쐍eeds to consider his position��.
What did Kafala actually say, again? He told the Independent that �쐗e know what political violence is, we know what murder, bombings and shootings are and we describe them. That�셲 much more revealing, we believe, than using a word like terrorist which people will see as value-laden.��
Hardly the words of an apologist for jihadism, as his critics seem to be suggesting. And, in fact, very much in line with the BBC�셲 editorial guidelines, which say:So �쐔errorist�� is a characterisation. Its meaning depends on context and intention (something crystallised by the line �� often quoted but never reliably attributed �� �쐎ne man�셲 terrorist is another man�셲 freedom fighter��). Those contexts and intentions have been set out by various national international bodies. The EU, for example, defines terrorism as acts such as attempted murder, kidnapping, etc, where the aim is of
The United Nations has struggled for years to come up with a widely accepted definition of terrorist activity. Writing for the Harvard International Review, Jori Duursma tells us that �쐔hough in the General Assembly no majority of member states agreed on a definition of terrorism, all member states agreed that terrorism was contrary to international peace and security��. Which is worryingly close to: we don�셳 know what it is, but we know that it�셲 bad.The security council, made up of a handful of member states, has been a bit more decisive. In 2004, it landed on this formulation:
That last bit is a tad circular: terrorism and terrorists are, at least partly, simply what we define them to be.That�셲 what 21st-century institutions have to say about terrorism. Can we learn anything from the term�셲 origin and use over time?
As ever, we turn to the trusted Oxford English Dictionary (20-volume version), which tells us it�셲 a borrowing from French, and dates from 1794.Back then the definition was: �쏿n adherent or supporter of the Jacobins, who advocated and practised methods of partisan repression and bloodshed in the propagation of the principles of democracy and equality��. Similarly, terrorism:
The meaning seems to have been extended through the 19th century to encompass �쏿 person who uses violent and intimidating methods in the pursuit of political aims��, directed at the likes of Irish dissidents or anti-tsarist revolutionaries. A Google search of instances of �쐔errorist�� and �쐔errorism�� in English-language texts over the last 120 years or so shows an extraordinary spike in the early 1970s, and a high level of use since then.Let�셲 zoom in then on that period �� the early 1970s �� when violent acts carried out in the service of political causes grabbed attention across the world. They did so largely because small, relatively powerless groups had begun to attack civilian targets such as airliners. It got them huge publicity. According to one commentator at the time, David Fromkin, this effectively turned their attacks into messages, broadcast globally.
Writing in July 1975, Fromkin provided a neat definition of what was then still a relatively new phenomenon. He traced the evolution of modern terrorism from anti-imperalist struggles �� in which the success of otherwise weak organisations such as Algeria�셲 FLN or Irgun depended entirely on the colonial power�셲 reaction �� in these cases France and Britain�셲 respectively. ��[Their] ingenuity lay in using an opponent�셲 own strength against him. It was a sort of jujitsu.��
The latest batch of fighters, however, �쐆ave transformed terrorism into a form of mass communication��. They rely on reaction to get their messages across. The more disruption they cause, the more glorious their success.Forty years later, Simon Jenkins was to echo this point in his reaction to the Charlie Hebdo massacre �� �쏷errorism is no ordinary crime. It depends on consequence.�� Foreign correspondent Patrick Cockburn agreed: �쏷o have an effective terrorist attack, you require the complicity of governments��.
Which means we end up with a dilemma. Fromkin describes a phenomenon that is different to ordinary criminal activity or warfare. Modern �쐔errorism�� has the peculiar property that it relies on its enemies to grant it victory �� and why not have a special word for that? Why not use it to describe the Charlie Hebdo attacks, which, in my view, fall into that category?
But the word itself casts a shadow of fear. Politicians deploy it to justify illiberal measures. The panic it evokes ramps up prejudice against minorities. It is even used to win support for wars. Wielded carefully, �쐔errorist�� could still make sense, 횪 la Fromkin. Used to frighten, cajole or slander, it�셲 one of the most toxic words of our times.Catalan authorities have definitively linked the death of a man found stabbed in a car outside Barcelona to last week�셲 terrorist attacks, raising the death toll to 15, as a manhunt for the main suspect was extended across Europe.
The victim was identified as Pau P챕rez, a Spaniard from Vilafranca del Pened챔s, 40 miles (64km) from Barcelona.He was found fatally stabbed in a Ford Focus that had forced its way through a police checkpoint on Thursday, just after a van ploughed into crowds in Barcelona�셲 Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 people.
Police had fired at the car, injuring an officer, and initially thought the man they found in the car had been killed by the gunfire. An investigation revealed he had been stabbed.
Police believe P챕rez was stabbed by Younes Abouyaaqoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan national who is alleged to have driven the van along Las Ramblas.
Abouyaaqoub fled the scene of the attack on foot and is thought to have killed P챕rez to take his car and escape the city.
Police have set up 800 vehicle checkpoints and tripled the number of officers working on anti-terrorism operations after the attack, but Abouyaaqoub continues to evade them.
El Pa챠s newspaper published images on Monday of a man it said was Abouyaaqoub apparently making a getaway on foot after the Barcelona van attack. The three photographs show a slim man in sunglasses walking through what El Pa챠s says is La Boqueria market, just off Las Ramblas.
Describing Abouyaaqoub as about 5ft 11 (1.80 metres), police tweeted four photographs of the man with short black hair, including three pictures in which he was wearing a black and white striped T-shirt. He is �쐂angerous and could be armed,�� police said,
Intelligence agencies had no warning of the 12-man jihadi cell that was originally planning a large-scale bomb attack before an accidental explosion at a house they were using in the town of Alcanar forced a change of plan.
Five were shot by a police officer during a second attack in Cambrils, where a Spanish woman was killed, and four have been detained.
Police said on Monday they had strong evidence that Abdelbaki Es Satty, the imam of the small town that was home to most of the attackers, was among the dead in the Alcanar explosion.
Es Satty, whom the police suspect of radicalising the young jihadis from Ripoll, was jailed in Castell처n in Valencia in 2010 for smuggling cannabis. He was released in 2014.
It is reported that while in prison he met Rachid Aglif, who is serving 18 years for his part in the 2004 Madrid bomb attacks that left 192 people dead and about 2,000 wounded.
His name also appears in a report after five men were arrested south of Barcelona in Vilanova i la Geltr첬 on charges of recruiting men to fight in Iraq.
Spain is in three days of mourning for the victims of the attacks, which were claimed by Islamic State. Las Ramblas is filled with about a dozen ever-widening pavement tributes of candles, flowers and messages of sympathy and defiance.
In Seville, anti-Muslim slogans have appeared on a building belonging to a Muslim foundation. In a mass at Valencia Cathedral, Antonio Ca챰izares, the archbishop of Valencia, warned against �쐒ifts between religions��.
�쏷here is no greater blasphemy than the murder of innocents,�� he said. �쏧slamist jihadism knows nothing but hate �� hate for God and for his most beloved creatures, human beings.��
Each time Youssef Zaghba landed in Bologna, there was someone waiting for him as he got off the plane. It was no secret in Italy that the 22-year-old Moroccan-born Italian, identified as one of three terrorists behind the London Bridge attack, was under close surveillance.
�쏷hey would talk to him at the airport. Then, during his stay, police officers would come a couple of times a day to check on him,�� his mother, Valeria Collina, said in an interview with the Guardian. �쏷hey were friendly to Youssef. They would say: �쁇ey son, tell me what you have been doing. What are you doing? How are you?�쇺��
In the weeks since the attack, Zaghba�셲 role has shone a light on the differences between how terror suspects are handled in Italy and the UK. Upon his arrival in London, Zaghba�셲 mother said, he was never once stopped at the airport or interrogated, even though Italian officials had warned British counterparts that he was a threat.
Franco Gabrielli, Italy�셲 chief of police, has said of Italy�셲 efforts to alert the UK: �쏰ur conscience is clear.�� Scotland Yard, in turn, has said Zaghba �쐗as not a police or MI5 subject of interest��.
Italy has suffered from its share of political violence in recent decades, including the murder of two prominent anti-mafia judges in the 1990s. But unlike almost all of its big European neighbours, it has not witnessed a major terrorist attack since the 1980s.
Is Italy just lucky? Have the country�셲 counter-terrorism policies �� born out of years of anti-mafia policing and intelligence work and a decade of bloody political violence in the 1970s �� given Italian officials an edge in the age of Isis? Or are there other factors at play?
�쏷he main difference is Italy doesn�셳 have a big population of second-generation immigrants that have been radicalised or could potentially be radicalised,�� said Francesca Galli, an assistant professor at Maastricht University and an expert in counter-terrorism policies.
It took about 20 people to watch a terror suspect full-time, Galli said. Naturally, the abundance of resources required to closely monitor anyone becomes more challenging if there are more suspects to watch.
Two recent incidents �� the case of Zaghba, and another, non-fatal terror incident in Milan in which a soldier and police officer were stabbed by an Italian whose father was north African �� point to a potential shift in the threat profile in Italy. But Galli said that generally speaking Italian police and counter-terrorism forces did not have to deal with a huge number of people who were potentially at risk of radicalisation, unlike France, Belgium and the UK.
That is not to say that Italy has escaped terrorist activity. Anis Amri, the Tunisian who attacked a Berlin Christmas market last year and was shot by police in the outskirts of Milan, was believed to have been radicalised in a prison in Sicily. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, the Tunisian behind the deadly attack in Nice last year, was identified by Italian police as having spent time in the border town of Ventimiglia.
Some experts say Italy has been able to combat the threat of Isis domestically by mastering legal and policing tools developed through years of experience in mafia investigations, which in turn were born out of the so-called �쐙ears of lead�� �� the period between the late 1960s and early 1980s marked by acts of political terrorism by left- and rightwing militants.
According to figures released by the Italian interior ministry, counter-terrorism authorities stopped and questioned 160,593 people between March 2016 to March 2017. They stopped and interrogated about 34,000 at airports and arrested about 550 suspected terrorists, and 38 have been sentenced on terrorism charges. More than 500 websites have been shut down and nearly half a million have been monitored.
Giampiero Massolo, who served as the director of Italian intelligence from 2012 to 2016, said there was not a particular �쏧talian way�� to combat terrorism.
�쏻e learned a very harsh lesson during our terrorism years,�� he said. �쏤rom that we drew the experience of how important it is to maintain a constant dialogue at the operating level between intelligence and law enforcement forces. In fact, prevention is key to try to be effective in counter-terrorism.��
He added: �쏛nother feature is to have a good control of the territory. From this point of view, the absence of [French] banlieues-like spots in Italian major cities, and ��[the predominance] of small and medium towns makes it easier to monitor the situation.��
There are also more specific practices. Arturo Varvelli, a senior research fellow and terrorism expert at the thinktank Ispi, said the lack of second- and third-generation Italians who might be susceptible to Isis propaganda meant authorities instead focused on non-citizens, who could be deported at the first signs of concern. Since January, 135 individuals had been expelled, he said.
Italian authorities also rely on intercepted phone calls, which unlike the UK can be used in evidence in court and �� in cases related to mafia and terrorism �� can be obtained on the basis of suspicious activity and not solid evidence.
Much like the fight against Italian organised crime �� the Camorra around Naples, the Cosa Nostra in Sicily, and the �셄dr횪ngheta in the south �� infiltrating and disrupting terror networks requires breaking close social and even family relationships.
People suspected of being jihadis are encouraged to break ranks and cooperate with Italian authorities, who use residency permits and other incentives, Galli said. There has been a recognition, too, of the dangers of keeping terror suspects in jail where, much like mafia bosses before them, prison is seen as a prime territory for recruiting and networking.
�쏧 think we have developed experience in how to deal with a criminal network. We have lots of undercover agents who do a great job of intercepting communication,�� she said.
While Italians authorities are seen as having broad powers, police do not have special powers to detain terror suspects without charge. Terror suspects may be held for up to four days without charge, just like any other suspect. However, Italy has been criticised by the European court of human rights for holding defendants too long once they have been charged and are awaiting trial.
Galli said there was no groundswell of concern about whether Italy�셲 tactics violated civil liberties. The broad use of surveillance �� including intercepted communication �� is seen as sufficiently targeted to terror and mafia suspects, unlike public criticism in Italy of sweeping data collection methods used in the US and UK.
The death toll from the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils on Thursday stands at 15, although scores more were injured, many of them seriously.
Here is what we know about the victims who have been identified so far:
The family of the seven-year-old boy confirmed on Sunday afternoon that he was one of the 13 people killed in the Las Ramblas attack.Julian had been reported missing after becoming separated from his mother, who was badly injured when a van drove into pedestrians in central Barcelona. It is understood that she is in a serious condition in hospital.Family members shared pictures of Julian in an attempt to locate him, while his father and grandmother were understood to have arrived in Spain on Saturday after travelling from Australia.
The boy�셲 father, Andrew Cadman, landed on Saturday afternoon to comfort his seriously injured wife, Jumarie, known as Jom. It is understood she was in the area to attend a family wedding when she and her son were struck by the terrorist�셲 van.
The Spanish missing persons bureau said in a statement: �쏪ulian Cadman�셲 family has told us he is unfortunately one of the victims of the attack and has asked us to thank all the people who have spread the news.
�쏧n these very unjust, hard and painful moments, we accompany Julian�셲 family and friends. Rest in peace. Once again we wish to reiterate our appreciation and involvement in your search.��
Tucker, 42, had left his wife for a moment shortly before the attack started. The couple, from Walnut Creek, California, were on a tour of Europe to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. They had been enjoying drinks on a pavement cafe on Las Ramblas.
�쏯ext thing I know there�셲 screaming, yelling,�� his wife Heidi Nunes, 40, told NBC News after she failed to find her husband after the attack. �쏧 got pushed inside the souvenir kiosk and stayed there hiding while everybody kept running by, screaming.��
On Friday night his family said that Nunes had identified his body. His father, Daniel Tucker, who worked with his son in the family�셲 pool business, told the New York Daily News: �쏧t�셲 something we really just don�셳 understand. I don�셳 know what else to say.��
Gulotta died on the street in front of his son Alessandro and wife Martina, Italian media reported.
Martina, who was carrying their one-year-old daughter, Aria, in a sling-style baby-carrier, told friends that she had pulled Alessandro to safety at the last moment.
The family were on holiday in the Catalan city.
Gulotta worked in sales and marketing for computer company Tom�셲 Hardware. The company said his violent death had left his wife facing �쐔rials no one should have to bear��.
�쏻e put ourselves in the shoes of little Alessandro, who is about to start elementary school knowing his and his family�셲 life will never be the same again. And we think of baby Aria �� who will never know her dad,�� his colleagues said in a statement.
Russo, 25, was on holiday with his girlfriend, Marta Scomazzon, who is among three injured Italians, having suffered fractures in the attack.
Scomazzon, whose parents have travelled to Barcelona to be with her, told the Italian news agency Ansa: �쏻e were walking together and then the van hit us. I fell and realised that Luca wasn�셳 there any more. I didn�셳 see him again. His body was swept away.��
Russo�셲 sister Chiara posted images on Facebook of her smiling brother, alongside those of his body lying on the ground in Barcelona. �쏦elp to bring him home, I beg you,�쇺�� she wrote.
He had graduated last year in engineering and had just started his first job. He was from Marostica, a town in the northern Veneto region.
�쏧taly will remember Bruno Gulotta and Luca Russo and expresses its solidarity with their families,�� the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a tweet. �쏤reedom will triumph over barbarism and terrorism.��
Vanbockrijck, 44, was reported to have been in the city on holiday with her husband and two sons, aged 11 and 14. Patrick Dewael, the mayor of Tongeren in Belgium, told Belgian radio that he had presided over her wedding in 2014.
Vanbockrijck regularly ferried her sons to football practice at KFC Heur Tongeren. A statement from the club said: �쏶he was often at the club, and was committed to our club. We will always remember her as a happy woman, a caring mother and loving wife. Elke will be missed.��
Rodr챠guez, 57, was the first Spanish victim to be named in the Barcelona attack.
He was originally from Granada and had been walking along Las Ramblas with his wife, who was seriously injured, her niece and the niece�셲 two children, one of whom was also killed (see below).
El Pa챠s reported that Rodr챠guez worked as a metal worker in Rubi and had been walking back from Barcelona port area when the van burst onto Las Ramblas.
Javier was the three-year-old grand-nephew of Rodr챠guez, who was also killed (see above).
Codina�셲 death was announced by the mayor of Sant Hip챵lit de Voltreg횪, a small town near Barcelona where she was from. Xavier Vilamala posted messages of condolence to the family of the 75-year-old on Twitter and Instagram.
Sara Sanchez Crosas, who said she was Codina�셲 hairdresser, also posted about the news of her death on Facebook, saying: �쏷he angels await you.��
Wilson was on holiday in Barcelona with his wife of 53 years, Valerie.
Their daughter, Fiona, a staff sergeant in the Vancouver police department, issued a brief statement on Friday hailing the efforts of bystanders and emergency workers who cared for her mother and tried to save her father�셲 life, and thanking those who had offered their sympathy and support.
She said: �쏧n the midst of this tragedy, my dad would want those around him to focus on the extraordinary acts of human kindness that our family has experienced over the past several days, and that is exactly what we intend to do.��
Sgt Wilson described her father as �쐁ompassionate, generous, adventurous, and always game for a lively debate, a good book, exploring new places, and a proper-sized pint��.
Ana Mar챠a Su찼rez was the sole fatality of the attack in the seaside resort of Cambrils.The 61-year-old, from Zaragoza, north-east Spain, was with her husband and sister, who were both injured in the attack.The Spanish royal family�셲 Twitter account confirmed her death, offering their thoughts to her family.
Lopardo, 80, and apparently the oldest person to die in the attack, was among three Italians killed in Barcelona, according to Italy�셲 foreign ministry.
News reports said Lopardo was an Italian who had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.
Pereyra, 40, was killed in Barcelona, Argentina�셲 foreign ministry confirmed. She grew up in Buenos Aires but had lived in Barcelona for over 10 years.
Her death was confirmed by family members living in Bolivia after a cousin identified her body at a morgue in Barcelona.
P챕rez, from Vilafranca del Penedes, 40 miles from Barcelona, was named on 21 August as the person found fatally stabbed in a Ford Focus just hours after the Las Ramblas attack. P챕rez was killed by the Las Ramblas van driver, and his vehicle used as a getaway car.
The names of a grandmother and granddaughter from Portugal have not been released.
A wave of coordinated gun attacks and suicide bombings has killed at least 127 people and seriously wounded almost 100 at a series of venues across Paris. Here is a timeline of the most serious terrorist attacks linked to Islamist groups or individuals in the west over the past 20 years.
25 July 1995, France: A gas and nail bombing at the Saint-Michel subway station in Paris killed eight people and injured more than 150. The attack was financed and coordinated by Rachid Ramda, an Algerian with links to the Armed Islamic Group, a fundamentalist group that targeted France for its support of the regime in Algiers.
11 September 2001, US: On 11 September 2001, al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four passenger jets on the east coast of the US and deliberately flew two of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan and another hit the Pentagon in Virginia. The fourth plane never reached its intended target, crashing in Pennsylvania. These acts killed almost 3,000 people.
11 March 2004, Spain: A series of bombs exploded in a coordinated attack on four commuter trains in the Spanish capital, Madrid, which killed 192 people and wounded more than 1,800. An Islamist group with links to al-Qaida was blamed for the attack. Twenty-one people, mostly Moroccans, were convicted of involvement in the attack, which was the deadliest in Europe since Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
2 November 2004, the Netherlands: Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh, a strong critic of fundamentalist Islam, was shot, stabbed and slashed across the throat while cycling through Amsterdam. Dutch-Moroccan Muslim Mohammed Bouyeri was later sentenced to life imprisonment for the film-maker�셲 murder, which a Dutch court ruled was a terrorist attack.
7 July 2005, UK: Four suicide bombers with explosives in rucksacks attacked tube trains and a bus in central London, killing 52 rush-hour commuters and injuring hundreds more. It was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil. The killers were later identified as British al-Qaida sympathisers Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain, Mohammed Sidique Khan and Jermaine Lindsay.
March 2012, France: Mohamed Merah, who espoused radical Islam and said he had links to al-Qaida, killed three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi and three French paratroopers in a series of point-blank shootings in and around the southern town of Toulouse. Merah was shot dead after a standoff with police.
22 May 2013, UK: British-born Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale murdered British soldier Lee Rigby in an al-Qaida-inspired terrorist attack outside Woolwich army barracks in south London. The pair ran over Rigby before they stabbed him and tried to hack off his head with a meat cleaver. They both claimed that they were �쐓oldiers of Allah�� and motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.
24 May 2014, Belgium: A gunman murdered four people in an attack at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in the centre of Brussels. Mehdi Nemmouche, a French national who had spent a year fighting with Islamists in Syria, was arrested and charged with the killings. The victims were two Israeli tourists, a French female volunteer and a Belgian employee of the museum.
22 October 2014, Canada: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a petty criminal, shot and fatally wounded a soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The gunman, who had recently applied for a passport and apparently claimed he wanted to travel to Libya, then stormed into Canada�셲 parliament where he was shot dead.
15 December 2014, Australia: Police shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born immigrant who claimed to be a supporter of Islamic State, following a 17-hour siege at a Sydney cafe. Two hostages �� a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman �� were also killed in the ensuing police raid.
7 January 2015, France: Masked gunmen shot dead 12 people at the Paris office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Four of the magazine�셲 cartoonists, including its editor, were among those killed, as well as two police officers. Brothers Said and Ch챕rif Kouachi, who had attended militant training camps in Yemen, were shot dead in a standoff with the gendarmerie near Charles de Gaulle airport.
9 January 2015, France: Gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed four people, including a policewoman, in a kosher supermarket in Paris and took others hostage. In a video released after his death, Coulibaly pledged allegiance to Islamic State and said he had coordinated his attack with the Kouachi brothers.
14 February 2015, Denmark: Omar el-Hussein killed two people and wounded five others in two attacks at a cultural centre and synagogue in Copenhagen. The gunman, a radicalised petty criminal, was killed by police in an exchange of fire after the worst attack on Danish soil for decades.
14 November 2015, Paris: A wave of coordinated gun attacks and suicide bombings killed at least 127 people and seriously wounded almost 100 at a series of venues across Paris. Eight assailants have been killed, seven of them in suicide bombings, a French prosecutor has said., but police are still hunting accomplices. The French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, has blamed Islamic State for the massacre and a state of emergency has been declared across France.
Following the posthumous albums Michael and Xscape, it would appear the well of unreleased Michael Jackson material is running dry. There was a flurry of excitement as a �쐍ew album�� was announced earlier this year, entitled Scream, due to go on sale on 29 September. But the only new music on it is a mashed-up version of five relatively deep cuts, tacked on to the end of a compilation �� one that is fascinatingly awkward in its presentation of Jackson.
He is one of the few stars to have become so big that they burn brightly long after they�셶e died. He has earned more than $100m every year since his death, the jukebox musical Thriller Live still plays on the West End, and his iconography �� gloves, light-up pavements, �쐁ha�셫one��, etc �� remains etched in our culture. But perhaps mindful of the way that another seemingly permanent supernova, Elvis, is dimming in our collective consciousness, Jackson�셲 record label Epic is using Scream to repackage him for a new generation.
Timed to mine maximum Halloween coin (�쏶cream reflects the King of Pop�셲 affection for this time of the year and its themes of costumes and disguise, darkness and light, character transformations and surprise,�� reads the press release), Scream�셲 artwork features bats and a full moon, and trades on Thriller�셲 celebration of cinematic horror. By framing Jackson as theatrically phantasmagoric �� a kind of horror movie character �� it attempts to deflect our attention from his real-life freakishness.
But it ends up underlining it all the more. The title track is not about a scream of delighted Halloween fear, but of pure frustration. One of the most interesting things about Jackson is how everything seems to tighten as his career progresses, from his dance moves to his chest and throat as he sings; initially lithe and in control on Rock With You, by the time of 1995�셲 Scream he is audibly contorted in his pent-up rage. Leave Me Alone is similarly wretched, a psychological study rather than a funhouse ride. Dirty Diana and Dangerous, both also included on the compilation, are howls of a different kind �� those of a man repelled by his own lust. On the latter he says, �쐓he came at me in sections�� �� he seems so terrified by women that he has to disassemble them.
Jackson�셲 use of horror movie tropes, meanwhile, is catnip for armchair psychologists. His joy in Thriller�셲 chorus, singing of the thrill of cinematic fear, is perhaps the joy of escapism; the scares are safely hemmed in by the four sides of a screen. But elsewhere he uses the vocabulary of horror films to directly express his personal fears. On Ghosts, he characterises jealousy as a phantom who stalks his house; Jackson himself becomes a ghost on Threatened, a fantasy of control where he moves omnipotently around a love rival. Is this man, so famously denied a childhood, having to grasp at film imagery to make sense of how he feels, in lieu of a proper grounding in emotion?
By framing these songs together, Epic have further underlined how complicated Jackson was, and further defined him as the strange, sexually fraught person that the compilation is perhaps trying to make listeners forget. The unavoidable fact is that his music was a scream, in every sense.
Five suspected terrorists have been shot dead by Spanish police in the coastal town of Cambrils, south-west of Barcelona, after they drove into pedestrians as part of what appeared to be the country�셲 second terror attack in a day.
Some of the suspects, who were travelling in an Audi A3, wore what appeared to be explosive belts, later found to be fake. The attack came hours after a van mowed down shoppers and tourists in Barcelona�셲 famous Las Ramblas district, killing 13 and wounding about 100.
The attack in Cambrils, where six bystanders and a policeman were also wounded, ended a day of bloody violence along the Catalan coast, which the police said was the work of a terrorist cell determined to �쐊ill as many people as possible��.
Video footage from Cambrils, 75 miles (120km) from Barcelona, showed three bodies on the ground in the town�셲 port. The police urged residents to stay indoors and later carried out controlled blasts on suspected explosive devices, amid reports the suspects had been wearing suicide vests or belts.
Part of the cell is thought to have blown itself up in the early hours of Thursday morning while trying to assemble a bomb in a house in another coastal town, Alcanar Platja, 120 miles south along the coast from Barcelona. One person was killed and another wounded in an initial explosion that destroyed the house. Police and firefighters who came to the scene were wounded by a second blast.
The Alcanar explosions were initially reported to have been caused by gas cylinders. The alleged link with a terrorist cell was revealed by the police only after the Barcelona attack.
At 5pm on Thursday a white Fiat van veered off the road and into a crowd on to the pedestrian section of Las Ramblas, the popular and celebrated Barcelona thoroughfare. The van drove through groups of people, sending pedestrians and cyclists flying, and stopped over a mosaic by the artist Joan Mir처. Of the 100 victims injured in the Barcelona attack, 15 were said to be in serious condition.
The driver fled on foot and was pursued by police. Streets and parking garages were combed for other vans thought to have been rented by the suspected terror group.
A second van �� presumed to be a getaway vehicle �� which had been hired at the same time as the Fiat from the Telefurgo rental company in Sabadell, near Barcelona, was found 50 miles away in Vic an hour and a half later.
By Friday morning, police said they had made three arrests �� one in Alcanar and two in the town of Ripoll �� but it was not clear whether any of those detained was the driver of the van. Catalan authorities have declared three days of mourning, and a minute�셲 silence is to be held in Barcelona�셲 Pla챌a de Catalunya at midday on Friday.
According to Spain�셲 El Mundo newspaper, postmortem examinations have already been carried out on the bodies of the 13 people who died in Barcelona. DNA samples have been taken and dental examinations will follow.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, boasting on a website: �쏷error is filling the crusaders�� hearts in the Land of Andalusia.�� The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said the whole country stood in solidarity with Barcelona, blaming �쐉ihadi terrorism��.
Javier Zaragoza, the chief prosecutor of the Audiencia Nacional, which deals with terrorism cases, said the attackers did not appear to have previous links to jihadism.
�쏛s far as we know, there was no previous investigation that might have identified them,�� he told the Cadena Ser radio station. �쏾ero-risk doesn�셳 exist when it come to these things. The anti-terror police services have done really good work for years and various attacks have been prevented.��
One of the arrested men was Driss Oukabir, a 28-year-old Moroccan initially named as a suspect. On Thursday evening, reports emerged suggesting Oukabir had handed himself in to police after seeing his photograph being circulated online and in the media. He apparently told officers that his identification documents had been stolen before the attack and that he had played no part in it. He was arrested in the town of Ripoll, where he lives, about 60 miles north of Barcelona.
The other detained suspect was a Spaniard born in the north African enclave of Melilla. He was held in Alcanar.
The use of vehicles as weapons is now a well-established terror tactic and has been seen in attacks in France, Germany, Sweden and the UK in the past 13 months.
Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, cancelled his holiday in Galicia, north-west Spain, to return to Madrid. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, and the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, also cut short their holidays to return to the city, as the regional government announced an emergency meeting.
Las Ramblas is the boulevard known to all visitors to Barcelona. Leading down from the large, open Pla챌a de Catalunya, the tree-lined boulevard is a shady release from the beating heat of the square.
At almost any time of the day, the area is full of people buying newspapers, postcards and souvenirs in the kiosks or looking at the flower stalls. Early on Thursday afternoon, with locals mostly away on holiday, a large number of those people were tourists.
Albert Tort, an off-duty nurse who was one of the first on the scene, said he tried to give an Italian tourist life-saving treatment, but there was nothing he could do. �쏷he pavement was full of bodies,�� he told TV3.
Other witnesses spoke of panic as people fled the scene. Jordi Lino, who was on a bus, said: �쏤irst I saw people running and then the van. There were injured people in the middle of Las Ramblas.��
Lourdes Porcar told Spanish TV she had seen the van running people over. �쏧t was going very fast, without caring about who was in its way,�� she said.
Patrick Tuenter, 20, a law student from Nijmegen, the Netherlands, was on the first day of his holiday. He reported �쏿 scene of total chaos�� as he returned from the beach. �쏱eople were screaming, there were a lot of wounded people,�� he told the Guardian.
At least 600 people were stuck inside restaurants in the area waiting for permission to leave, as police locked down the area and warned people to stay away.
In the panicked moments after the attack, rumours flew around the city, including reports of gunfire in El Corte Ingl챕s department store �� later confirmed as untrue by local police, who advised people to follow official sources for updates.
Catalan emergency services advised people to stay away from the area around Pla챌a de Catalunya. Police asked people to communicate via social media and messaging instead of phone calls, as mobile telephone coverage was saturated.
More than 1,000 people on Facebook volunteered to help the victims, with offers ranging from water to shelter and translation.
Isis used the Amaq news agency to claim that some of its members had carried out the attack. �쏷he perpetrators of the Barcelona attack are soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting coalition states,�� the agency said, referring to a US-led coalition against the militant group.
Spain suffered what is still Europe�셲 deadliest jihadi attack in March 2004, when bombs exploded on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people in an attack claimed by al-Qaida-inspired extremists. But until Thursday, Spain had escaped the more recent wave of extremist violence that has struck France, Belgium, Germany and the UK.Terrorists have turned vehicles into weapons in France, Germany, Sweden and the UK in the past year. Last week a car was driven into a crowd protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in what was described by Republican senator Marco Rubio as �쐔error attack by white supremacists��.
Last July, 86 people were killed in Nice when a 19-tonne truck mowed down people on the beach promenade. A Christmas market in Berlin was the scene of a similar atrocity in December, when 12 people were killed by a truck packed with steel.
In April, five people died after a lorry attack in a busy shopping area in central Stockholm. In June, a speeding van hit pedestrians on London Bridge before attackers launched a knife attack in cafes and restaurants at Borough market. Eight people died in the attack, and at least 48 were wounded.
Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks in Nice, Berlin and London Bridge. The Uzbek national suspected of the Swedish lorry attack had expressed sympathy for the group.
According to western intelligence officials, Islamist propaganda has switched its tactics, from calling on people to travel to Syria to join a self-declared caliphate, to urging them to carry out attacks in the countries where they live.
Such vehicle attacks generally require very little planning and no wider network, leaving little or no opportunity for the authorities to detect and stop them.
As details of the attack emerged, condolences poured in from around the world, with a typically controversial response from Donald Trump. The US president revived an already debunked anecdote about a US general dipping bullets in pig�셲 blood to fight Islamic militants more than 100 years ago.
The British prime minister, Theresa May, said the UK stood with Spain against terror. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said: �쏧 hold a special thought for the heroic people who responded by running towards danger to help others and to the security forces who are working to keep the population safe.��
Maximum sentences for certain terror offences should be longer, according to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.
Max Hill QC, who took up the role three weeks before the Westminster Bridge attack, suggested the crime of failing to alert authorities to possible attacks ought to be punishable, in serious cases, by jail terms of more than five years.
There is no need for fresh anti-terror laws in the aftermath of jihadist attacks in Manchester and London this year, he said, but aspects of existing laws could be amended and improved.
�쏻ith the benefit of experience and hindsight it may be the case that some offences have insufficient discretionary maximum sentences, which should be reviewed,�� Hill said.
Section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000, under which an individual commits an offence if they do not inform police when they believe someone is preparing acts of terrorism, is one that may need attention, he noted.
Several defendants who assisted the plotters behind the failed 21 July bombings in 2005 were convicted under this section. The offence currently carries a maximum sentence of five years. �쏧t seems to me that that should be reviewed for a decision on whether that is actually sufficient,�� Hill said.
During the election campaign in June, Theresa May pledged to introduce �쐋onger prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences�� as well as doing more to �쐒estrict the freedom and movements of terrorist suspects��.
In his interview with the Press Association, Hill also proposed reviewing general crime offences which were perfectly appropriate for use in terrorism cases.
He said: �쏻e have robust and appropriate laws dealing with firearms, knives, assaults and violence against the person. There is already a mechanism for judges to regard a terrorist mindset as an aggravating factor in non-terrorist offences but that is something that needs to be provided by way of a list or a schedule to indicate to judges which offences may be aggravated by a terrorist mindset.��
Hill repeated his call for greater reliance on terrorism prevention and investigation measures, which place restrictions on suspects who cannot be deported or prosecuted. Six Tpims were in place at the end of May.The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said there had been a sparing but appropriate use of the measures and an increase was conceivable. He gave the potential example of someone returning to the country who cannot be placed on trial but may be an appropriate candidate for a Tpim.
�쏧 don�셳 see the prospect of very large numbers of returning UK citizens but we are told that there may be some,�� he said. �쏛nd that�셲 where, alongside the power to prosecute, the power to place individuals on Tpims should be considered.�쓀K citizens who return from Syria after committing criminal acts should generally face prosecution, Hill said. �쏧n cases which may come to light of individuals who travel to Syria out of naivety or brainwashing and are desperate to return to their friends and families in this country in a state of great disillusionment after their time in Syria, it doesn�셳 follow that in every case those individuals must be prosecuted or that there must be any mandatory process against them.�쒬ounter-terror agencies are understood to be running 500 live investigations involving about 3,000 individuals at any time, while there are also 20,000 former �쐓ubjects of interest�� who have to be kept under review.Hill said it would be quite wrong to argue that thousands of people should be either arrested, deported or otherwise have their lives interfered with because their name appeared in an individual piece of intelligence.
The terror cell that brought carnage to north-eastern Spain, killing 15 people and injuring more than 130, was planning attacks on a much larger scale, including the bombing of Barcelona�셲 Sagrada Fam챠lia church, a suspect has told a court.
Mohamed Houli Chemlal made the admission after being brought before a judge in Madrid, Spanish media reported, quoting court officials.
Houli, 21, confirmed what police said they had concluded last week: that the group had been planning large-scale bomb attacks before an explosion ripped through a house in Alcanar where a number of them had been staying, killing two of the plotters.
One of the proposed targets was the Sagrada Fam챠lia, the half-finished church designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud챠 that is one of Barcelona�셲 best loved buildings.
Houli arrived at the audiencia nacional in hospital-issue pyjamas, his right arm bandaged and his face bearing some of the injuries he is said to have sustained in the explosion last week.
He was the first of four suspects to be questioned by Judge Fernando Andreu..
A Spanish national from Melilla, one of the country�셲 north African enclaves, Houli was arrested in hospital after police realised that the house in Alcanar, in southern Catalonia, had been turned into a bomb factory.
The other three men who appeared in court were arrested in Ripoll, 145 miles north of Alcanar. They were Mohammed Aallaa, 27, whose blue Audi car was driven by five members of the group into a number of pedestrians in Cambrils, a coastal town south of Barcelona; Sahal el Karib, a Moroccan-born businessman in his 30s; and Driss Oukabir, 27, whose brother Moussa, 17, was one of five men shot dead after the Cambrils attack.
Last week Driss Oukabir told police that his brother had stolen his documents to hire vans used in the attacks. However, according to reports of his court appearance on Tuesday, he admitted to the judge that he had hired the vans but claimed he had believed they were needed for a house move.
All four suspects were represented by court-appointed lawyers. The judge later remanded Oukabir and Houli in custody charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder, ordered that Karib be held for a further 72 hours pending further questioning, and freed Aallaa.
As the hearing progressed, police were attempting to reconstruct the final 96 hours in the life of the member of the cell who killed 13 people and injured more than 130 others when he drove a hired Fiat van along the crowded Las Ramblas last Thursday.
CCTV images show Younes Abouyaaqoub clambering out of the white van after it crashed into a newspaper kiosk and walking slowly away through La Boqueria, the famous covered food market beside Las Ramblas.
He is now known to have escaped from the city in a car that he took from a vineyard worker, Pau Per챕z. Abouyaaqoub approached Per챕z in the Universitaria district in the north of the city, killed him by stabbing him in the chest, bundled his body into the back of the Ford Focus car and drove away.
Nothing more was seen of Abouyaaqoub until he was cornered on a road in the Subirats district, 30 miles west of Barcelona, on Monday afternoon. When police approached him he is said to have shouted �쏥od is great�� in Arabic and opened his shirt to show what appeared to be a suicide vest.
The officers immediately shot and killed him. He was the sixth member of the cell to be shot dead.
Police kept their distance and used a robot to examine the device Abouyaaqoub was wearing. Like the devices worn by the five men who were shot dead in Cambrils early on Friday, it was fake.
Abouyaaqoub appeared not to have washed between Thursday and Monday. Police believe he walked to Subirats by night and hid by day. He was carrying a knife wrapped in plastic when he died, but had no bag, no phone and no money. He had changed his clothes, however: police do not know where he did this.
In Morocco, a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being connected to the cell. He is understood to be a cousin of the Oukabir brothers, and previously lived in Ripoll.
Court officials told Spanish media that Houli also confirmed investigators�� suspicions that the cell had been radicalised and was organised by Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam in Ripoll.
Es Satty, who was in his 40s, was one of two people who died in the bomb factory explosion in which Houli was injured. Houli told the court that Es Satty had intended to mount a suicide bomb attack.
A number of relatives of the dead terrorists have told how Es Satty attempted, without success, to make them become religiously more conservative. �쏦e wanted to give me some talk and one day he started telling me that listening to music was bad,�� one relative told El Pa챠s newspaper. �쏧 told him not to brainwash me. He never spoke to me again.��
In Ripoll, friends of Abouyaaqoub recalled him as a �쐁alm, rather quiet, somewhat shy�� young man, who had been a good student and who had studied, almost effortlessly, for a degree in electromechanics. He was said to have had two passions: cars and football.
Meanwhile, the French interior minister has confirmed reports that the Audi used by the terrorists in the attack in Cambrils had been caught on camera speeding in Paris.
G챕rard Collomb said of the terrorists that �쐔his group came to Paris but it was a quick arrival and departure��.
French media reported that the car went through the Paris region about a week before last week�셲 attacks and that it had also been spotted in the Essonne region south of the capital.
A second man has been arrested as Dutch police investigate a terrorism threat that led to the cancellation of a concert in Rotterdam on Wednesday.
The concert by the US rock band Allah-Las was called off after Spanish authorities warned of a possible plot targeting the venue.
Dutch police confirmed they had arrested a 22-year-old man in the early hours of Thursday.
�쏦e is in custody and will be questioned about the threat in Rotterdam,�� police said, adding that a thorough search of his home had been conducted. The man was detained in Brabant, a province to the south of Rotterdam, but it was not known where he was being held.
But the driver of a Spanish-registered white van carrying gas canisters who was arrested on Wednesday night was released.
The van driver, a repairman, had been driving close to the Maassilo concert venue where the band had been due to perform. Police said he was possibly drunk.
Explosives experts checked his van and found nothing suspicious beyond the gas canisters. A search of the man�셲 home �쐕ncovered no link with the terror threat �� at the Maassilo��, police said. �쏷he man, a repair man, had an explanation for the gas canisters.��
Spanish authorities had already said it was unlikely there was any connection between the van and the attacks that killed 15 people in Barcelona and Cambrils last week.
The terrorist cell in Spain had been plotting attacks on a much larger scale, one suspect told a court, as more details emerged of the bomb factory in Catalonia where the group had been making explosives and suicide vests, before an explosion caused them to change plans.
Spanish counter-terrorism police received �쏿n alert indicating the possibility of an attack [on Wednesday] in a concert that was going to take place in Rotterdam��.
The venue, a former grain silo, was evacuated before the event began, with organisers citing an �쐕nspecified threat��.
Dutch television showed officers in body armour outside Maassilo and what appeared to be members of the band leaving the venue in a white van with a police escort. By midnight, the area was calm and police had lifted the cordon, Dutch television station NOS reported.
Mexican Summer, the Allah-Las�� label, said: �쏷he band is unharmed and are very grateful to the Rotterdam police and other responsible agencies for detecting the potential threat before anyone was hurt.��
In an interview with the Guardian last year, band members said they had chosen the word Allah, Arabic for God, because they were seeking a �쐆oly sounding�� name and had not realised it might cause offence.
�쏻e get emails from Muslims, here in the US and around the world, saying they�셱e offended, but that absolutely wasn�셳 our intention,�� said the lead singer, Miles Michaud. �쏻e email back and explain why we chose the name and mainly they understand.��
The terrorist cell which killed 14 people in Catalonia on Thursday was planning to mount a bombing attack in Barcelona that was only abandoned when they accidentally blew up the house where they were stockpiling explosives.
Thirteen people were killed and more than 130 injured after a white Fiat van ploughed along Las Ramblas in the Catalan capital on Thursday. Eight hours later, a Spanish woman was killed and six people were hurt after a car thought to be carrying five members of the same cell ran down pedestrians in the coastal town of Cambrils. All five terrorists were shot dead by police.
Reports on Friday afternoon suggested that the driver of the van used in the Las Ramblas attack, who had been hunted by police, was among those killed in Cambrils, but police later suggested he may still be on the run.
Despite the carnage and chaos wrought, Catalan police said the cell had apparently been preparing a far bigger attack in Barcelona.
Josep Llu챠s Trapero, a major with the Mossos d�섷squadra, the Catalan police, said that the gang had been gathering butane gas canisters at a house in the small town of Alcanar, 120 miles south of Barcelona. However something went wrong and the building exploded on Wednesday night, killing two people and wounding 16.
�쏷he explosion in Alcanar meant they no longer had the necessary material to plan larger-scale attacks in Barcelona,�� said Trapero. �쏷hey were probably trying to carry out a different kind of attack.
The lack of bombing capacity is thought to have led the cell to use two vans they had hired �� possibly with the idea of loading them with the gas canisters �� in the kind of pedestrian ramming attacks seen in Nice, Berlin and London.One was abandoned on Las Ramblas. A second van, which was found later in the town of Vic, 50 miles north of Barcelona, is believed to have been intended as a getaway vehicle. Reports suggested the gang might have initially attempted to hire a much bigger truck, but did not possess the correct documentation.
Police have arrested four men �� three Moroccan citizens and one Spanish citizen, aged 21, 27, 28 and 34.
On Friday night they named the five shot dead in Cambrils, who included Moussa Oukabir, 17, who had been reported to be the driver in the Ramblas attack. The others killed were El Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, 19, Said Aallaa, 19, Omar Hychami, 21, and Mohamed Hychami, 24. All were listed as born in Morocco.
Police are still hunting Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they now suspect may have been the van driver in Barcelona, along with two other unnamed suspects. They are also seeking a white Renault Kangoo vehicle believed to have been rented by the suspects and which could have crossed the border into France, according to French media reports.Oukabir, Hychami and Abouyaaqoub are though to be from the small town of Ripoll in Catalonia, while Aallaa is from the nearby village of Ribes de Freser.
Javier Zaragoza, the chief prosecutor of the Audiencia Nacional, which deals with terrorism cases, said the attackers did not appear to have previous links to jihadism.
�쏛s far as we know, there was no previous investigation that might have identified them,�� he told the Cadena Ser radio station. �쏾ero risk doesn�셳 exist when it comes to these things. The anti-terror police services have done really good work for years and various attacks have been prevented.��
Moussa Oukabir�셲 older brother Driss was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of hiring the van used in the attack. He has denied any involvement and is thought to have told the police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to rent the vehicle.
Jordi Munell, the mayor of Ripoll, said the town was in a state of shock following the events of Thursday and Friday.
�쏳ipoll is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody else,�� he said. �쏻e don�셳 understand how people we�셶e been living side by side with could be involved in terrorism, and nor do their families. These are people that people have been to school with and played football with.��
Little is known about Moussa Oukabir. However, attention has already focused on comments he made on the social media site Kiwi. Asked what he would do on his first day if he became absolute ruler of the world, he replied: �쏫ill the unbelievers and leave only Muslims who follow their religion.�� Asked in which country he would never contemplate living, he answered: �쏷he Vatican.��
The Cambrils attack came at the end of a day of violence along the Catalan coast, which the police described as the work of a terrorist cell determined to �쐊ill as many people as possible��.
The attackers�� plans to use a car, knives, machetes and axes to kill as many people as possible were thwarted after they crashed into a police car. A single officer is reported to have shot dead four of the attackers while another killed the remaining terrorist a few minutes later.
Fitzroy Davies, from Wolverhampton, was in Cambrils and saw one of the attackers being shot by police. He told the BBC that he had seen people running into the bar where he was as the assault unfolded.
�쏷his guy came running up the road and was shouting something. I didn�셳 know what it was, so we said, �쁟all the police,�쇺�� he said. �쏻ithin 30 seconds the police were already there, jumped out of the car, started shouting at the guy; the guy was then saying something else again. And then they �� �쁯op, pop�� �� did a couple of shots and he fell down.
�쏦e stood back up and then he stepped over the fence and he started, he was taunting, smiling and he carried on walking to the police, and then they gave it to him again, a couple more shots and then he fell to the ground.��
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Las Ramblas attack, saying on a website: �쏷error is filling the crusaders�� hearts in the land of Andalusia.�� The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said the whole country stood in solidarity with Barcelona, blaming �쐉ihadi terrorism��.
At midday local time on Friday thousands of people gathered in Barcelona�셲 main square for a minute�셲 silence to remember the dead. Among those in attendance were King Felipe of Spain, Rajoy, Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan regional president, and Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona.
At the end of the minute�셲 silence, the crowd broke into applause and chanted �쏯o tinc por�� (�쏧 am not afraid��).
Authorities said on Friday night that 59 people injured in the attacks were still in hospital, with 15 in a critical condition and 25 in a serious condition.The mayor of the French city of Nice �� where dozens of people were murdered just over a year ago by an attacker driving a truck �� said that he would meet his European counterparts next month to determine what can be done to improve security after the Barcelona attack.
Eighty-six people were killed in the jihadist attack in the French Riviera city, the first of several similar incidents in Europe.
�쏧 am convinced that life will prevail over death and that we will triumph over barbarism and terror,�� Christian Estrosi told reporters after an event to honour those killed in Catalonia.
He said the mayors of several cities would meet in Nice at the end of September and discuss the issue with Julian King, the European commissioner in charge of security issues.
Estosi said they would talk about the best ways to improve the situation and review national and European legislation and proposals that were at times too restrictive.
�쏻e won�셳 win the war with the rules of peace,�� Estrosi added.
As is so often the case in terrorist cells, the group that brought carnage to north-east Spain last week �� killing 15 people and injuring more than 130 �� included several sets of brothers.
Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, has been identified by police as the driver of the van that sped down Las Ramblas on Thursday. He was shot dead by police in Subirats, a town 30 miles west of Barcelona, on Monday. His brother Housainne, 19, was among the five men shot dead by police in the coastal town of Cambrils hours later after the car in which they were travelling ploughed into a group of pedestrians.
Mohamed Hychami, 24, and his brother Omar, 21, were shot by police in the same incident.
Mohammed Aallaa, 27, is being questioned by police after his car was used in that attack. Mohammed�셲 brother Said, 18, was also shot dead in Cambrils. The whereabouts of a third brother, Youssef, remains unknown, leading to speculation that he may have died in a premature detonation that ripped through the cell�셲 bomb factory in Alcanar on Wednesday night.
Moussa Oubakir, 17, was the fifth terrorist shot dead by police in Cambrils. His brother Driss, 27, is being questioned by police after turning himself in, though there is no confirmation of his involvement in the cell.
While the number of familial connections may appear extraordinary, a number of studies of jihadist radicalisation suggest it is not. Terrorism is a highly social form of activism, and peer influence is a key factor: individuals become interested in ideas, and then committed to a course of action, because others have had the same ideas and developed the same commitment.
Research conducted by a US thinktank, New America, two years ago suggested more than a quarter of individuals who had travelled to Syria or Iraq to fight with Islamic State had a family or marriage connection to another jihadist.
Examples include Abdullah Deghayes, 18, and his brother Jaffar, 17, from Brighton, who both travelled to Syria in 2014 and died in fighting a few months apart.
A study by Pennsylvania State University of 120 supposed �쐋one wolf�� attackers found that in 64% of cases, some family members or friends had been aware of their intentions.
Terrorist brothers include Sa챦d Kouachi, 34, and his brother Ch챕rif, who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015, opening fire with Kalashnikovs, killing 12, including a Muslim policeman on the street outside.
Brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev bombed the Boston marathon in April 2013, killing three people and injuring several hundred others.
Salah and Ibrahim Abdeslam, who were both involved in the Paris attacks of November 2015, seem to have become radicalised together while growing up in the Molenbeek area of Brussels.
Waleed and Wail al-Shehri sat side by side on the American Airlines aircraft that was flown into the World Trade Centre�셲 North Tower on 9/11, and are believed to have stabbed two unarmed flight attendants during the hijacking. Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi were among the hijackers who flew another American Airlines aircraft into the Pentagon on the same day.
Most Europeans have rarely lived amid such peace and plenty, and take prosperity and security for granted. It is that assumption of established wellbeing that makes a terror attack the more shocking, and the fear it inspires the more contagious. This is most true on the streets of a place like Barcelona, whose ancient buildings belie its reputation as혻one of the youngest, liveliest and loveliest of혻European cities.
It is partly this international, cosmopolitan character that makes it a terrorist target: what happened here on Thursday afternoon has not only left a city in mourning. The waves of terror and grief for children, mothers, fathers, lovers and pensioners ripple out to the 34 different countries from which they came, and far beyond. After a related attack along the coast in Cambrils, holidaymakers of every nationality, faith and ethnicity will be more anxious, more fearful and less trusting.
But events in Barcelona have also provoked spontaneous demonstrations of courage and resilience. On Friday morning, only hours after the attack on Las Ramblas, people were gathering there again not just to pause for reflection and remembrance but to sing and shout their defiance.
It is too early to know the precise motivation behind this attack and quite how, or how far, its perpetrators were recruited and organised. Police say the cell planned a bombing, but accidentally detonated its stockpile of explosives. But whether it was part of their original plan or an improvisation, this has all the appearance of being another in the lengthening sequence of devastating vehicle attacks �� Nice, Berlin, Stockholm and London �� inspired, if not orchestrated, by Islamic State or similar groups. This is terrorism in the age of the internet, sometimes dependent on sophisticated tools like encrypted messaging, or grooming that might be carried out from afar, or the ability to build an explosive device; sometimes only on holding a driving licence and a recognised ID document.
Spain, like Britain and to a lesser extent France and Germany, has long experience of living with and ultimately defeating other kinds of terror �� ETA, the IRA and the Red Army Faction. The new generation share some attributes with the earlier groups: they believe in the propaganda value of the deed and the catharsis and symbolism of violence familiar from their forerunners. The last ETA attack was in 2006, two years after jihadis first struck, bombing four commuter trains in Madrid.
But technology enables more elusive ways of organising; it facilitates the lone actor as well as the cell. And when terrorists draw their inspiration from Islamist extremism �� as when, like Jo Cox�셲 murderer Thomas Mair, they are inspired by racist rightwing ideology �� it poses more profound challenges to community cohesion than, say, separatist revolt. They intend to divide.
As Londoners know from recent attacks, it is impossible to defend all public space from a driver in a rental van intent on murder. The large well-placed planter or the movable barricade can only do so much against the low-tech attack. But it is even more difficult, and even more important, to defend the mutual respect for rights and freedoms by which heterogenous western societies prosper.
That means the internet giants patrolling the margins of what they host in a more coherent and consistent way. It also means that politicians who have a duty to express their country�셲 anger and hurt do not reach automatically for further powers for security agencies when often the bigger challenge is making sense of what they already know.
Each of the waves of terror that have disrupted European countries in the past 50 years have taken a generation or more to play out; the former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, said in a rare interview recently that he thought the fight against Isis too would take another three decades. It is widely recognised that it will never be possible to prevent every terror attack in a free society. But terror will have won if, in the fight against it, we fail to protect the sense of shared purpose and trust that bind society together.
At least 13 people are dead and dozens injured after a van crashed into a crowd of people in Barcelona�셲 Las Ramblas area. Hours later, in the seaside town of Cambrils, a second vehicle hit pedestrians leaving one dead and six wounded.
We spoke to witnesses of the attacks.
I live close to the centre and was walking to see a friend on the other side of the city when I heard screaming, lots of it. Half a second later people started coming down a really narrow ally off Las Rambas. Everyone was yelling at me and telling me to run. Then the police turned up and they were also telling people to run down the street.
I was very lucky I didn�셳 see anyone initially hit but as I walking away I went past one of the smaller local health centres. I saw someone surrounded by people. The person was completely indistinguishable, covered in a blue sheet with tubes poking out, they were surrounded by medics and police officers escorting them into the ambulance, trying to avoid attention.
When it happened you just join the crowd, the fear hits you and you just immediately need to get away. It feels surreal. You run for about 30 seconds and then stop and check to see if it�셲 real. Police were pushing people back. By the end of last night you could not get anywhere near the centre, everything was shut down.The first thing I did was call my girlfriend and my family to let them know I was safe. At first I didn�셳 realise the gravity of the situation and hoped it was a false alarm. You just can�셳 imagine that something like this could be real until you�셱e face to face with the situation.
Lots of people were stranded. I have a friend who was at the top of Las Ramblas in a cafe and they were locked in for two and a half hours. Hotels were keeping people in and helping people in whatever way they could. Some time in the night the police pushed the tape back and allowed people to access Las Ramblas again.The atmosphere on Friday was very strange �� people were going about their businesses as if nothing had happened. It was very quiet. Barcelona is notoriously loud and never sleeps but lots of people are very quiet right now.Last night we went to a coaches�� meal and we were sitting at the table outside when four girls came up to us running and screaming. Two of them were crying, one was hysterical and the other was so scared she could not say anything.
They were running from a man wearing what appeared to be a suicide jacket but it looked fake. One of our colleagues, Winston, got up and saw people running past him and shouted: �쏳un, run.��
That�셲 when I started filming what was happening. I didn�셳 run away because I was thinking �� �쐇f this guy gets away and they need evidence then I want to help��. I watch CSI and all those programmes that was one of the reasons why I did that.
It looked like he was wearing Coca Cola cans on him. I was about 15ft away and it didn�셳 look real. Within what felt like about 30 seconds the police came and shots were fired. The guy went down to the floor and then he came back up again. He was smiling. It looked like he was high on drugs. Then he was shot again and this time he didn�셳 get back up.
I wasn�셳 scared during the whole event. But afterwards I spoke to my wife and she was mad at me ... she said anything could have happened.
I am in Cambrils because I came out here to do a judo training camp. Luckily none of the judo team were there. The older girls have gone to judo today but the younger ones may go this afternoon if they are feeling better.
I am OK today, I feel alright about it. There�셲 nothing much can do about it. I just look at it like we are here in Spain and may as well just carry on. This is going to be the best place to be now as there will be more security.
I was on my way home when I walked straight into a pack, hundreds, of running, screaming people with panic on their faces. I turned and ran with them. Some were ducking into shops and hiding. The atmosphere was pure fear. I�셫 staying on the other side of Las Ramblas, so I tried to cross another way and was turned back. I entered the Pla챌a de Catalunya and another pack of terrified people ran towards me, and flooded down the steps of the department store El Cortes Ingl챕s.
I didn�셳 wait to see what they were fleeing, I ran with them and crouched behind a bin in a pizza or panini-making stand in the food hall. A kind Catalan woman put her arm around me. I was really shaky and there was a lot of people down there. I think they locked us in. For ages, we were all too scared to leave. I started getting messages from people. Such a weird thing to say I�셫 hiding in a department store. It was really scary, I was imagining gunmen, as we�셱e trained to think, and I had a racing heart. I plucked up the courage to dash back to the language school. We were locked in until it closed at 9pm. Helicopters circled and sirens wailed as we sat stunned on the terrace answering messages from home and drinking beer. I know how lucky we were. I walked home a long way round to find my street cordoned off, swarming with police.
When I did walk home, it was weird and empty and surreal. The street where I�셫 staying was cordoned off. There were rumours of gunmen in restaurants close to where I live. It was terrifying. I feel shaken and weird and sad. Just really sad for the city. It�셲 a new reality, in a few hours it changes, and it�셲 a new thing that�셲 happened. Everyone adjusts. Everyone�셲 been so sad. Everyone is traumatised. It�셲 such a wonderful place, it�셲 just so shocking.
A British family who were metres away from the Las Ramblas van attack praised the quick reaction of the police and the kindness of strangers in making them feel secure.
Jackie Rado, 51, and her daughter Kristin RadoBarr, 14, who were on a family holiday with Tony Barr, 46, and Alexander RadoBarr, 12, were shopping at make-up store Sephora 100 yards from La Rambla. Their husband/father and son/brother were on their way back to their hotel when the van ploughed into pedestrians. The family were separated for three hours as the area was put on lockdown.
We were just about to leave Sephora, on the corner of La Rambla, and get ice cream at La Bocqueria on La Rambla, but we were distracted by something on sale. We were on the ground floor and suddenly people started to race downstairs, hysterical. We were scared and no one knew what was going on. We were downstairs but we could hear sirens. We heard there was a van going down La Rambla, and people coming in must have seen what had happened.
We were locked in the store for three and a half hours. I just kept trying not to think about it and stay calm. We were right there where it was happening. Sephora had docking stations for our mobile phones so we could follow the news. The staff were reassuring, giving us water and trying to keep everyone calm.
I keep pushing away the thought of what might have happened if we hadn�셳 done an about-turn in the store. We were right on the corner of where the van went down the street. I couldn�셳 believe how quickly the atmosphere changed from normal to static. I couldn�셳 believe we were in that situation.
My husband and son had a scarier time as they were more aware of what was happening. We knew we were safe. We were going to be safe. We were worried for them as they saw more panic. My son got such a big shock because for them they were waiting for us and that was hard.
We�셱e off to the Sagrada Familia sightseeing today, continuing our holiday. What else can we do?
We were going upstairs, on our way out, but went back down when someone offered to show us make up. While I was being told about make up there were loud noises outside. We were the first store in Sephora, close to the entrance. The person I was with ran to the entrance and soon after people came flooding down screaming and crying. Me and my mum ran to the back of the shop where we could be safe.
I felt more scared than I ever have. The whole way through people were very nice, they had drinks and food. Although it was very scary, we felt safe. We had chargers and were checking the news and looking at the make up. I spoke to French people who spoke English. A lot of people who came into the shop from outside were crying or speaking quickly or in shock. I was just staying with my mum as much as I could. It was very quiet when we were evacuated but we felt safe. The police told us to leave in small groups of fifteen people.
I�셫 OK, but not really believing that it all happened.
I was in the south-west of the area with my son, visiting football stores.
As we were coming out of the metro on our way back to the hotel, people were telling us not to come to the area. There were a lot of street vendors at the top of the subway standing in a group and waving us away telling us not to come up. A group of Spanish families came rushing down the stairs. I spoke to an older Spanish lady and a French couple. It seemed like the news had spread and we stayed in the underground behind the ticket barrier.
When we came out my son was worried about his mum and sister. We headed to the hotel, as we did that the police were cordoning off the areas. We went towards Pla챌a de Catalunya, but at one point the police began shouting at us to get back. People were panicking and rushing and screaming. We eventually got back to our hotel. They checked everyone�셲 ID before entering and kept everyone updated. We were in lock down.
My wife and I can�셳 speak highly enough of the police. They were calm and very happy to take questions. The hotel staff were wonderful. Everyone is looking after each other. People are going out of their way to interact and smile to Muslim guests. At the toaster this morning, I discussed with a Muslim woman how hot we should put the toaster. It wasn�셳 forced, but I�셫 aware that we should all be thoughtful.
I feel different about it to some other attacks. We were living in Bangkok during Red Shirt violence, and we were in our apartment watching Bangkok burn down. We knew we weren�셳 part of it. This time I wasn�셳 worried for our safety, but I was very upset and angry knowing how close they were to my family. They�셝 been closer to it than many people. I was upset about the intent of it. I was very relieved when they came home, at that point we felt the danger had passed.
The FBI accused Apple of prioritizing its public relations strategy over a terrorism investigation on Friday in a significant escalation of this week�셲 war between the tech company and the law enforcement agency.
The accusation, made in a court filing demanding Apple comply with an order to unlock an iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino terrorists, represents a nadir in the relationship between two opponents that previously extended each other public respect.
�쏛pple�셲 current refusal to comply with the Court�셲 Order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy,�� Justice Department attorneys wrote in the Friday filing.
Tim Cook, Apple�셲 CEO, called the court order �쐁hilling�� in a letter published on the company�셲 website. Cook called for public debate and has been backed in his fight by some of tech�셲 biggest names, including Google�셲 chief executive Sundar Pichai, WhatsApp and whistleblower Edward Snowden.
�쏷he United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand,�� he wrote.
The government and the US�셲 most valuable company have been shadowboxing over digital privacy since fall 2014, when Apple expanded the use of encryption on its phones. In a shift, Apple said it would no longer be able to unlock devices for authorities, even if faced with a warrant.
But the disagreement has been mostly cordial. Even in January 2016, FBI director James Comey and other national security officials met Tim Cook in San Jose in an effort to mend fences and look for other areas of cooperation.
The government on Friday took off its gloves.
It accused Apple of �쐍umerous mischaracterizations�� of the government�셲 request and �쏿n incorrect understanding�� of the law underlying the Justice Department argument.
The government has asked Apple to write and digitally sign software that would make it easier for investigators to guess the passcode for an iPhone 5C used by Syed Farook, one of the shooters in the December attack in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead.
Apple said that forcing it to do so would undermine trust in the security of its company�셲 products. The government, in effect, would be forcing it to hack one of its phones through the automatic update process consumers use monthly.
�쏷he same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe,�� Cook wrote.
If Apple complies with this order, the company argues, it will set a legal precedent that will allow the government to order �쐕pdates�� on suspect�셲 Apple products again and again.
The problem, the government counters, is that Apple has complied with similar requests in the past, before it tightened the security of its products. In the past the government, says, it hasn�셳 made the same public protests.
A key government claim is that it is seeking access to one particular device, thereby limiting the danger to Apple�셲 security features, and would permit the company to retain possession of the specific code it would have to write to unlock the phone. The company maintains that once it does that, it sets a precedent that law enforcement officials would use at every opportunity when it cannot immediately unlock a suspect�셲 phone.
The Justice Department said Apple had cooperated under the law in previous cases and was falsely attempting to make a legal exemption for the iPhone Farook used. It also rejected Cook�셲 contention that it was being asked to introduce a security flaw onto its devices that would stretch beyond the current case.
Department lawyers made particular note of pre-2014 compliance the company gave, before it introduced a version of its mobile operating system that removed the company from possessing decryption keys for its users. They contend that Apple, as a provider of the secured communications, is inherently responsible for fulfilling warrant requests for third-party data.
�쏪ust because Apple has sold the phone to a customer and that customer has created a passcode does not mean that the close software connection ceases to exist; Apple has designed the phone and software updates so that Apple�셲 continued involvement and connection is required,�� the government lawyers contend.
The filing comes as the government is waging its own public relations battle over the increasing use of encryption by tech companies. For more than a year Comey has been pushing the Obama administration and Congress to regulate how companies like Apple use encryption that can stymie his agents. Both sides have declined, realizing that the FBI fought and lost a similar battle �� the so called Crypto Wars �� during the Clinton administration.
�쏛t no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the Order, or that the Order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging development task,�� the government�셲 filing says. �쏰n this point, Apple�셲 silence speaks volumes.��
But the government in its filing seems to acknowledge its legal push is about much more than gaining access to a single phone. Rather, it wants to ensure it can maintain access to any phone.
�쏻here Apple designed its software and that design interferes with the execution of search warrants�� where it owns and licensed the software used to further the criminal enterprise, where it retains exclusive control over the source code necessary to modify and install the software, and where the very software must now be used to enable the search ordered by the warrant, compulsion of Apple is permissible,�� the government says.Apple has yet to file any formal response with the court. A hearing is scheduled in California for 22 March.
I woke up this morning early. I normally don�셳 wake early. We set our alarm for 6:30 to get to the airport, as we�셱e flying home from Spain today. Today I don�셳 need an alarm because I have my own internal alarm: it went off sometime before 5pm yesterday and it�셲 still ringing. I check my husband and son are beside me: they are safe.
I get up to go the bathroom and the bruise on my thigh makes it slightly sore to walk. This is my war wound. A physical reminder of what happened yesterday in Barcelona. It�셲 about 4in long and 2in wide, bright purple and hard to touch. It�셲 quite unremarkable and a small price to pay. In some ways it�셲 a comfort. It reminds me that I am not crazy, that what happened yesterday was real. It is a temporary tattoo and will be gone very soon. I would imagine the emotional bruise will last a little longer.
My son thinks that a moving bench may have hit me. He is six years old and he said he saw it. My husband wonders if it was a postcard stand, or the man who was hit beside me. I�셫 pretty sure it was not the van or I wouldn�셳 be writing this. I most likely ran into a bench and find it strange that I don�셳 remember. I remember everything else.
We had just left the El Corte Ingl챕s supermarket and agreed to a quick stroll on Las Ramblas before returning to our hotel. My husband doesn�셳 really like Las Ramblas, and we had not been on this trip, but what is a trip to Barcelona without a visit to Las Ramblas? So, laden with our shopping, we agreed to grab an ice cream, soak up the ambience and go back to our hotel.
We were wandering slowly with the crowds when we heard the shots. Two loud claps, and then chaos. My husband shouted �쐒un!�� and we started to move.
It was over in seconds. Surprisingly for me, I learned that there is enough time in such moments to register that something is very serious. I knew they were terrorists. The crowds split, with people running to the sides at lightning speeds. But what were they running from?
I thought I would throw myself on my son in an effort to protect him. I am weirdly proud of this moment as I have always thought of myself as rather selfish, and can honestly now say that my priority was him.
I turned to my right, saw my husband�셲 expression of horror first, and then the van. It was at most 10ft away and coming right at us. The screen was cracked with a bullet hole. My son says that his ankle is twisted and that it is my fault. I�셫 sure he is right. I am not ashamed of this. I�셫 just surprised his arm is still attached to his shoulder given how hard I yanked it.
I close my eyes. We are not hit. My husband said it mounted the pavement on two wheels and just missed us. The driver evidently did not want to hit the newsstand behind us.
We crouched for a few seconds behind the stand, realised we were unharmed and checked on a nearby injured man. We did not hang around. We had no idea what else might happen. Before we knew it we were in a nearby restaurant where the manager boarded up the premises. It is amazing how fast news travels when you are removed from the situation, but how slow it is when you are there. I must have spent 20 minutes Googling �쏝arcelona attacks��, �쏬as Ramblas terror�� etc while my search yielded stories from two years ago. Was this Islamic State? I thought so. Were there many injured and dead? Probably. But it would be a while before we knew for sure.
We texted home, our batteries died and we waited. Four hours later, armed forces released us one by one with our arms over our heads. The rational part of my brain told me that they were there to protect us but the instinctive part was not so sure. They were dressed for raids, with heavy machine guns and shouting in a language I do not speak.
We were escorted in groups of 20 to the Pla챌a de Catalunya and briefly questioned. The officer wrote �쐍ada�� beside our names. This referred to how helpful we would be in relation to capturing the suspect, but it did not feel like �쐍ada�� to us.
It is strange watching the news. I keep looking for us or the man right beside us who got hit. The footage does not capture what we saw and many of those interviewed were much further away.
I am a psychiatrist and am wondering about post-traumatic stress disorder. The incident certainly qualifies. Five years ago I battled stage four cancer, so I�셶e some experience with trauma and I get in touch with my mortality more often than most people my age. I sometimes think it makes me a better psychiatrist. This might just be my way of coming to terms with a very difficult time in my life. I�셫 wondering what I will tell myself about yesterday. I was less scared going through it but may be more after it. I think that I am fine today, and then jump out of my skin when I hear an announcement or see someone running to catch a flight. My son seemed OK but asked me why there were still sirens when we were in the hotel restaurant. Out of the blue, he said to both of us that he wished he had waited until he was 10 to come to Barcelona because then he would have been braver when the crazy man drove at us with the van. We both nearly cried.
I am in the airport now and in a long queue to get home. I cannot wait. When we get home our lives will return to normal. Our son will go back to school and we will go back to work. Most importantly, we will be safe. We will no doubt carry some effects but will mostly hold onto how lucky we are and how precious life is. My bruise will be gone long before the injuries of others who were there. While we will have difficult memories to process, we will thankfully not have to process loss.
I vow to hug my family tightly and tell them how much I love them. When I pray or meditate, which I need to do more often, I will now be thankful for my safety, in addition to my health and happiness.
We know we are lucky. We can move on. But what about the families in states riven by terrorism? This must be their daily struggle. I need to do more to help. We all do.
Hours after a van killed 13 people and injured 100 in Las Ramblas, the seaside town of Cambrils was hit by second vehicle attack, leaving one dead and six wounded
Shocked Spaniards and tourists have described how they ran for their lives to escape the van that into a crowded street in central in Barcelona on Thursday in the first of two terror attacks to hit Spain in the space of 24 hours.
On Friday, the country began three days of national mourning after the double terrorist atrocity that left 14 people dead and more than 100 injured.�쏧 walked straight into a pack, hundreds of running, screaming people with panic on their faces,�� said Madeline Feeny, a 31-year-old Briton studying at a TEFL language school five minutes from the Pla챌a de Catalunya.
�쏧 turned and ran with them. Some were ducking into shops and hiding. The atmosphere was pure fear.��
Feeny said another crowd of people ran towards her as she tried to cross Pla챌a de Catalunya.
�쏧 didn�셳 wait to see what they were fleeing. I ran with them and crouched behind a bin in a department store. A kind Catalan woman put her arm around me. I was really shaky.��
Feeny eventually plucked up the courage to return to the language school. �쏧 know how lucky we were,�� she said. �쏣veryone�셲 been so sad. Everyone is traumatised. It�셲 such a wonderful place, it�셲 just so shocking.��
Richard Gregg, from Kent, who is on holiday in Barcelona, said it was only good fortune that prevented him being among the victims.
The drama teacher and his partner were on a side road trying to return to their apartment off the main thoroughfare when they first became aware of a commotion.
�쏱eople were running, shouting �쁏eople have been hit, there�셲 blood everywhere��. We had nowhere to go apart from into Las Ramblas.��
He said police were flooding the side roads looking for someone, he now knows to be the van driver, while other officers attended to victims on the ground.
�쏻e have been out [today] on La Rambla to see where the van ended up and where everyone was hurt and we�셱e really grateful because if we�셝 been there two minutes earlier or the van had been two minutes later we would have been in the path of it without a shadow of a doubt.��
Scott Strudwick, from the UK, was in a department store with his family, when he was caught up in the attack on the busy shopping street.
�쏷he panic was quite infectious,�� he told the BBC. �쏻e were all driven back into the back of the shop and then we went into a hairdressing salon and we hid in a small storage cupboard at the end [of the salon].
�쏻e were crammed in, it was very frightening, lots of people crying, lots of people very upset.��
Another British family was separated for three and a half hours, as police locked down Las Ramblas. Jackie Rado, 51, and her daughter Kristin, 14, took refuge in makeup store La Sephora, 100 yards from La Rambla, where they had been shopping.
�쏱eople came flooding [in] screaming and crying,�� Kristin told the Guardian. I felt more scared I ever have felt.�� She added: �쏷he whole way through people were very nice. They had drinks and food. Although it was very scary we felt safe.��
Her mum said she kept �쐏ushing away the thought of what might have happened�� if the pair had not been distracted by something in the sale, delaying their exit from the shop by crucial minutes.
�쏧 couldn�셳 believe we were in that situation. My husband and son had a scarier time as they were more aware of what was happening.��
Max Gayler, 23, from Birmingham, witnessed the aftermath of the attack, as he walked to meet a friend. �쏣veryone was yelling at me and telling me to run. Then the police turned up and they were also telling people to run down the street.��
�쏻hen it happened you just join the crowd, the fear hits you and you just immediately need to get away. It feels surreal. You run for about 30 seconds and then stop and check to see if it�셲 real.��
Shops were re-opening on Las Ramblas on Friday, with kiosks selling newspapers recounting the horror that had unfolded on the street the day before.
�쏬ife seems to be going back very quickly to normality,�� University of Glasgow rector Aamer Anwar told the Press Association, although the police presence on the streets remained �쐆uge��, he added.
�쏶hop owners are opening up, stalls are back out on the street, but I�셫 conscious that there are two types of people here. There are those that saw what happened, there were those who were right in the heart of it, like myself, and then there were others who were tourists who had no clue.��
�쏧 was conscious of that yesterday when I was in Las Ramblas, when there were people like myself who were in shock, people upset, people crying, but then there was people who had no idea what had gone on, laughing and getting on with life and whatever.��
Hours after the devastating attack on Barcelona�셲 most famous street, similar scenes were playing out in the coastal town of Cambrils. Five suspected attackers were shot dead by police after a van ploughed in pedestrians, copying the brutal attack in Barcelona hours earlier.
According to one witness, a terrorist suspect shot dead by Spanish police last night appeared to be wearing Coke cans to mimic a suicide belt.
Fitzroy Davies, from Wolverhampton, was visiting the resort town for a judo camp, and saw police shoot the suspects. �쏧t looked like he was wearing Coke cans on him. I was about 15ft away and it didn�셳 look real.��
He said the police arrived quickly and shots were fired. �쏷he guy went down to the floor and then he came back up again. He was smiling. It looked like he was high on drugs. Then he was shot again and this time he didn�셳 get back up.��
Davies said he filmed the events because he thought the police could use his evidence: �쏧 wasn�셳 scared during the whole event. But afterwards I spoke to my wife and she was mad at me �� she said anything could have happened.��
UK counter-terrorism police have released a four-minute video detailing their �쁱un, hide, tell�� advice in the event of a firearms attack. It shows holidaymakers under attack at a hotel. The video narrative begins by saying that such attacks are rare but advises people to be prepared. Police first used the �쁱un, hide, tell�� advice following the London Bridge attack.
The murderous acts this week bring into sharp relief the threat in Europe and its neighbours from within and without. Within a few hours, three attacks splattered blood on the pavements of the region�셲 historic streets. Three men were shot and injured in an Islamic centre in Zurich. For the first time in almost 90 years, a Russian ambassador was shot dead; Moscow�셲 man in Turkey was assassinated at an Ankara art gallery by a local police officer who cried �쐂on�셳 forget Syria!��. Then a large truck in central Berlin ploughed through one of Germany�셲 most hallowed holiday institutions, the Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring dozens. The roots of such violence can be traced to many things: religious extremism; fanatical ideology; poverty; disaffection. None can be used to excuse homicidal atrocities. When terrorists, rather than criminals, perpetuate violence, governments often respond in extraordinary ways.
This is the worry in Germany, which thanks to its emphasis on personal privacy and its open attitude to refugees has been seen as a liberal beacon in western Europe. Its politicians however have responded with calm and restraint. There has been nothing like the decision of the French government to declare a state of emergency and launch air strikes in Syria in late 2015 after terror attacks. Nor was Berlin closed down, like Brussels, which was in lockdown for three days during a terrorist manhunt last year. There will be, however, fallout. The Berlin truck attack is the worst the country has seen in recent years. A suicide bombing at a summer music festival this year in southern Germany killed only the terrorist. A few days earlier five people were injured in a knife attack on a train in Bavaria. Only the attacker died �� shot by police. Like the suspect in the Christmas market, both the earlier militants were refugees who had recently arrived in the country. After the Berlin terrorist strike, the MEP husband of the far-right Alternative for Germany party leader tweeted an absurdly macabre taunt: �쏷hese are Merkel�셲 dead!�� With a national election and a key regional poll looming in the country�셲 most populous state �� one in which the truck bomber suspect stayed �� the door is likely to be slammed shut on Berlin�셲 liberal asylum policy. The far-right across Europe are seeking to profit by stirring fears and insecurity. The Dutch rightwing populist Geert Wilders tweeted an image of Mrs Merkel covered in blood. Terror has impacted a continent�셲 capacity for altruism. The authoritarian populists want to unleash the state on their citizens, in the name of protecting their virtue. This is embodied by increasing snooping and social control. President-elect Donald Trump�셲 call for a Muslim database is disquieting for these reasons. Edward Snowden revealed America�셲 National Security Agency could collect 42bn internet records a month and 5bn mobile-phone location records a day in 2011. Yet terrorist outrages in the US continued.
In Germany, the worry is that the culture of privacy will be rolled back. The country�셲 strict data protection laws and restrictions on electronic surveillance are a historical legacy meant to deny the re-emergence of a powerful entity such as the Nazi Gestapo, or the East German Stasi. Yet two days after the Christmas market attack, Angela Merkel�셲 cabinet approved a bill which could herald a vast expansion of video surveillance cameras in public places. Thanks to its decentralised constitution, no one would be legally required to install them. The real issue, long acknowledged in Germany, is that policing �� a function of local government �� is often not a public spending priority. As Berlin�셲 Green party told the Guardian: �쏧ncreasing the number of police officers (is) much more important to help track down suspects.��
It helps to consider the sum of the facts rather than the sum of our fears. The University of Maryland calculates that 10,537 people were killed in 18,803 reported terror attacks between 1970 and the end of 2015. In western Europe, terrorist incidents were more common 40 years ago. But in a world of social media, panic and fright spreads faster, its velocity accelerated by the unhinged brutality of Islamic State. Protecting the public may mean greater intelligence sharing across Europe. It may mean some temporary restrictions on movement and public spaces. But expanding counterterrorism efforts should avoid casting Muslims, who are also often victims of terrorism and the target of hate crimes, as the enemy within. To shield us from an atomised, self-radicalised terrorist threat, we should not implement a strategy that will destroy a society it aims to protect.
That�셲 the central (and sometimes almost the only) question asked now in the immediate aftermath of violence �� and for good reason. All of us know that what happens next �� the social and political meaning of the crime �� hinges almost entirely upon the answer. Speculation about the London stabbing has followed a similar pattern, since everyone knows that a connection to Islamic State (Isis) will entirely change the significance of otherwise uncontested facts.
When, on 20 July, a man rammed a Sydney police station in a car loaded with flammable material, early reports described the episode as a �쐔errorist attack��. Conservative MP George Christensen provided a taste of what might have followed had those accounts checked out: immediately, he took to Facebook, calling for a national response to �쐒adical Islamism��.
But Christensen had jumped the gun. Subsequent reporting identified the assailant as a 61-year-old white man with mental health problems, and the story almost immediately dropped from the headlines. The act itself hadn�셳 changed �� someone has still sought to set a police station alight �� but now the crime meant something altogether different. No one called for an urgent summit about mental health. There were no cries for increased funding to crisis intervention teams or new legislation to regulate treatment. There was no panic. There was almost no reaction at all.
The peculiar contrast between the terrorist crimes that reshape public debate and the non-terrorist crimes that don�셳, becomes even starker in the aftermath of mass shootings, even as the incidents themselves seem harder and harder to tell apart.
Take the following description:
Today, most people would assume the passage describes a terrorist atrocity �� the latest outrage by adherents of Isis, perhaps. In reality, it comes from forensic psychiatrist Paul E. Mullen�셲 study of what he calls �쏿utogenic massacres��, a term he coins specifically to distinguish mass murders like the Port Arthur rampage in Australia or the Sandy Hook massacre in the US from killings with an external motivation (such as terrorism).
Subsequent research has amended that claim somewhat. In his study, The patterns and prevalence of mass murder in twentieth-century America, Grant Duwe does find instances of crimes fitting the same pattern, particularly during the 1930s. Nonetheless, Duwe accepts Mullen�셲 main point: in the past 50 years, spectacular murder sprees have become more and more common.
Duwe wrote those words in 2004. Last year, the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight explained how the trend had developed: ��[t]here have been more total mass shooting incidents and deaths [in the US] in the 11 years starting with 2005 than there were in the previous 23 years combined.��
But our new familiarity with autogenic mass killings also obscures something else: the changing nature of terrorist violence. Specifically, the spectacular atrocities conducted by men self-identifying with Isis have redefined our understanding of terrorism, so that the act now seems almost synonymous with random public murder.
Again, in the past, matters were different.
Contrary to what might be imagined, if we graph terror incidents in the United States over the last few decades, we see a constant and dramatic downturn from a peak in about 1970 (with only a very slight recent upturn in the last year or so). That�셲 because most of the recent terrorism in America emerged from the tumultuous 60s, as groups on the right and the left fought over the meaning of the social change underway.
The crimes committed by terrorists historically involved an array of acts: political assassinations (generally of public figures), bombings (often of symbolically important locations), kidnappings, skyjackings and so on. Some organisations and individuals did, of course, target civilians. But very few terrorist groups embraced public and indiscriminate slaughter as an end in itself, for the simple reason that mass murder doesn�셳 win political support.
Or, to put it another way, murders committed by terrorists tended to look very different from murders conducted by non-political rampage killers.
Now, however, they often don�셳.
Think of the attack on the gay club in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people died and 53 others were wounded. On 12 June 2016, Omar Mateen walked into the Pulse nightclub armed with a Sig Sauer MCX semi-automatic rifle and a Glock handgun , and began killing everyone he saw. From a description of the crime alone, there�셲 no way of knowing whether the perpetrator was (to use Mullen�셲 terminology) an autogenic killer.
In fact, during the rampage Mateen declared his allegiance to Isis and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi �� and, for that reason, was widely described as a terrorist. But he doesn�셳 seem to have been particularly religious. We know, for instance, that he drank and had affairs; it�셲 also been suggested that he was sexually attracted to other men. Indeed, in many respects, Mateen�셲 profile seems much closer to that of a rampage murderer than a terrorist operative. He was unsuccessful in his career. He had a history of physical violence in his relationships and consistently abused steroids. His ex-wife describes him as �쐌entally unstable and mentally ill��.
In his fascinating article Lone Wolf Terrorist or Deranged Shooter?, Joel A Capellan examines the perpetrators of what he calls �쐇deologically active shooter events�� in the US: that is, gun massacres in which the killers saw themselves as motivated by a political or social cause.
He concludes that the ideological and non-ideological perpetrators of mass shootings are actually remarkably similar:
Now, we need to be careful not to collapse politics into psychology. Whatever else was happening in Mateen�셲 life, his repetition of Isis slogans during the murders indicate that Islamist ideology provided, at the very least, a trigger for his violence. It�셲 perfectly possible that, without Isis doctrine to legitimate his violence, Mateen might have remained merely another ordinarily unhappy individual.
For that reason, one cannot discuss terrorism in the west without reference to the ongoing US military interventions in the years after 2001. Osama bin Laden mounted the 9/11 attacks knowing that the inevitable response would polarise public opinion along �쐁lash of civilisations�� lines, with Islamism becoming the most obvious alternative for those outraged by injustices in the Muslim world.
Bush�셲 disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq exceeded all of bin Laden�셲 expectations, even if Isis has now largely supplanted al-Qaida. Think, for instance, of the catastrophe that�셲 befallen the people of Iraq and Syria, where continuous conflict has rendered democratic and secular politics impossibly difficult, and made possible the murderous nihilism of Abu al-Baghdadi.
The Washington Post recently described Barack Obama as bequeathing to his successor �쏿 state of quasi-war that could extend for years to come��. It�셲 not difficult to understand how that semi-permanent conflict drives both Islamic extremism and Islamophobia, both of which will sporadically manifest in the form of terrorism.
But can we also identify a connection between war and the marked increase of ostensibly autogenic massacres?
In my book, Killing: Misadventures in Violence, I investigated the strange psychological appeal that combat exerts, even �� and perhaps particularly �� over those who recognise its horror. Think of the first world war: greeted with a giddy exhilaration by many young men, who hailed violent conflict as an antidote to the banality of modernity.
Again and again in the literature of the time, you see the same argument. Industrial civilisation might have brought material comfort but it had also dissolved the older social ties in which men and women found meaning. The factory and the office were soulless and emasculating, while technology and bureaucracy stripped adventure and romance from ordinary life. That�셲 the context for Rupert Brooke�셲 famous call to his generation to turn away from a world grown �쐎ld and cold and weary��, to leave behind the �쐆alf-men�� who would not fight, and to plunge into purifying war �쏿s swimmers into cleanness leaping��.
In his recent Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging, the veteran war correspondent Sebastian Junger makes a similar argument about modern conflicts. Modern society has, he argues, �쐏erfected the art of making people not feel necessary��. By contrast, combat radically simplifies life; it promises honour and purpose and camaraderie to men who might otherwise never experience such things.
That�셲 why, as he says, �쐄or many people �� war feels better than peace.��
In researching Killing, I interviewed a young man called Jeremiah Workman who�셝 earned a Navy Cross by killing more than 20 insurgents with grenades and small arms fire in Fallujah in 2004. He was ferociously patriotic, a spokesperson for the pro-war group Veterans for Freedom. But he was also unabashedly nostalgic for what he�셝 left behind in Iraq.
�쏪ust about anyone you talk to,�� he said, ��[who has been] over there, they want to go back. It�셲 very dangerous but life is so simple �╈��
Then he spoke about combat itself.
Junger quotes Dr Rachel Yehuda, the director of traumatic stress studies at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. ��[Combat is] the most important thing someone has ever done �� especially since these people are so young when they go in �� and it�셲 probably the first time they�셶e ever been free, completely, of societal constraints.��
As that passage implies, if combat appeals, it�셲 partly because it offers an escape from peace.
�쏥iven the profound alienation of modern society,�� Junger writes, �쐗hen combat vets say that they miss the war, they might be having an entirely healthy response to life.��
Now consider another famous poem from the Great War. In Into Battle, Julian Grenfell presents combat as a kind of resurrection, since �쐆e is dead who will not fight/And who dies fighting has increase��. Strikingly, as I�셶e argued elsewhere, the conclusion of the poem reads like an invocation of the berserker state of the rage murderer.
Grenfell found his own �쐀urning moment�� by dying in combat in France. But, of course, the first and the second world wars were mass conflicts, struggles that touched, to some extent at least, most of the population.
Today�셲 wars (at least for westerners) are not. That�셲 one of Junger�셲 key points: the experiential gulf between those who fight and those who don�셳 has probably never been greater. At the same time, since 2001, public life has been dominated by Iraq and Afghanistan and their ramifications. Is it so surprising, then, that lost and dysfunctional individuals of the kind Capellan describes instigate murderous violence as a way of giving themselves, even if only for an instant, a clarity and purpose they�셶e never felt before?
�쏧t may be worth considering,�� says Junger, �쐗hether middle-class American life �� for all its material good fortune �� has lost some essential sense of unity that might otherwise discourage alienated men from turning apocalyptically violent.��
The reference to �쐌en�� here is significant. The values combat promises to restore are those of a patriarchal order, as per Brooke�셲 dismissal of the �쐆alf-men�� who won�셳 fight. The academics Marissa A. Harrison and Thomas G. Bowers studied 91 cases of autogenic massacre �� and in 90 of the cases they reviewed, the perpetrators were male.
Again, the argument�셲 not that the stated reason a murderer gives for his crimes should be ignored. No doubt the rhetoric of Isis did influence Omar Mateen, just as the Islamophobic calls for counter-jihad helped trigger Anders Breivik�셲 murders in Norway.
Yet the current insistence on entirely separating ideological and non-ideological rampages seems rather perverse given how closely autogenic and non-autogenic massacres now resemble each other. The accelerating rate of non-political mass murders suggests that, at very least, those calling for more killings are sowing seeds in fertile ground.
If that�셲 the case, ending the carnage may require more than simply ending the wars (as necessary as that remains). We need also a more profound discussion about constructing a different kind of peace.
A dark, narrow staircase leads up to the seventh-floor flat in the small Catalan town of Ripoll from where Abdelbaki Es Satty allegedly masterminded the terrorist cell that struck in Barcelona last Thursday.
A bottle of the Moroccan imam�셲 scent sits on a sideboard, the miswak root he used to clean his teeth lies on a bedroom shelf, and his green Qur�셙n nestles behind the TV where he watched the daily news.
�쏦e didn�셳 talk much,�� said Es Satty�셲 flatmate, Nordin. �쏦e seemed normal. His face and words were normal. I didn�셳 know what problems he had in his head.��
The last Nordin saw of Es Satty was on Tuesday morning, when the imam left home with a suitcase, saying he was going to visit his family in T챕touan in northern Morocco.
�쏦e said goodbye and told me he would be back in time for the Lantern festival [on 1 September],�� recalled Nordin, who said the imam drove off in a large white car. �쏧 didn�셳 notice anything out of the ordinary.��
On Monday, however, Catalan police confirmed that Es Satty never went to Morocco. Instead, DNA of his remains have been found amid the debris of a bomb-making factory in Alcanar that exploded the day after he left home.
Spanish anti-terrorism investigators are now working on the assumption that the imam was the �쐁atalyst�� in the radicalisation a cell of a dozen mostly young Moroccan men in Ripoll, where he had been leading prayers and teaching Arabic for the past two years.
There were three sets of brothers among the alleged terrorists, many of whom went to the local Abat Oliba school and played football on the pitches next to the Ter river.Ripoll is no Muslim ghetto, but a quiet, moderately prosperous town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees. It is famous for its monastery, Santa Maria de Ripoll, which was founded in the 9th century by Count Wilfred the Hairy, an important figure among Catalan nationalists.
About 5% of the town�셲 11,000 population are Muslim. Most are Moroccans who started arriving in the early 1990s to work at local factories.
Interviewed on Monday, Ripoll�셲 officials and residents expressed their shock that boys who were considered good students could have had their heads turned to the point that they were responsible for last week�셲 atrocities.
Unemployment has risen in recent years but local officials discounted it as a major factor in the radicalisation of the town�셲 terror cell, because most had jobs or were students. �쏻e�셱e in shock. These boys were raised among us. There�셲 no ghetto here. They were our neighbours,�� said Dolors Vilalta, the secretary of security in the municipal government.
�쏻e had no inkling. If we had a hint we would have acted, but there was nothing,�� she said. �쏷rust is broken. The feeling of security is gone. But we can�셳 give in to anger. That would be dangerous. We must move on.��
Relatives, friends and neighbours blame Es Satty. After he arrived in town, young Muslim men spent more time at the mosque.
One local Catalan man, who declined to give his name, said he used to play football with Younes Abouyaaqoub, confirmed by CCTV images released on Monday as the man who drove a van into crowds on Las Ramblas.
�쏦e was a quiet guy who never seemed violent,�� he said of the Moroccan, who grew up in the community.
Younes�셲 brother Houssaine, who was shot by police in Cambrils early on Friday morning, worked at a local kebab shop and was said to be friendly to all his customers. �쏷hey must have been brainwashed,�� said a schoolfriend. �쏰therwise I can�셳 see how they would have done this.��
A 21-year-old Catalan woman �� who like many others declined to give her name because everyone knows everyone in this small town �� said she had known one of the terrorists, Mohamed Houli, since childhood.
�쏦e was a good friend,�� she said. �쏛t school he never had any problems with anyone. He loved football and cycling. Everyone thought he was Catalan.��
Houli was found alive in the ruins of the bomb factory blast. He has been arrested and his testimony is thought to have been the key to the progress of the investigation.
Es Satty had been identified as a person of interest even before his DNA was confirmed at the bomb factory.
He was the only one of the 12 suspects with a criminal record. According to Spanish media reports he was convicted of marijuana smuggling and had spent time in Castell처n prison in Valencia, where he is said to have met at least one of the perpetrators of Spain�셲 last major terrorist attack, the Madrid bombing of 11 March 2004. Local media say his name was also mentioned in reports about the recruitment of Spanish youths who went to Syria to fight for Islamic State.
Nordin says police came to search the home on Friday night. They climbed into the attic, looked inside the cistern and ripped off ceiling panels. The imam�셲 room is still as they left it �� clothes pulled from drawers and dumped on the floor between a skewed mattress.
They also questioned Nordin, who moved into the flat�셲 other small room four months ago. The 45-year-old Moroccan market stall worker �� who did not want to give his full identity because he fears repercussions for his family �� told them the imam had never received a single visitor at the apartment. In June he had left for more than a month, saying he was visiting family in Morocco. He returned less than a week before the attack.
Nordin said Es Satty rarely read his Qur�셙n and would only pray in his own room or the mosque. �쏧slam had nothing to do with the killings here or in France,�� he said, then tapped his head again. �쏷he problem is here.��
At the town hall, the mayor, Jordi Munell, looked as if he had not slept for days. He said he was not just grappling with the security operation and the media attention, but the bigger question of how this happened. �쏻e don�셳 understand. These boys weren�셳 marginalised. They were neighbours, teammates, supermarket workers, schoolfriends.��
The trigger, he guessed, was the arrival of the imam in 2015. Although he gave no indication of being a radical, Es Satty was withdrawn from wider society. The mayor believes he was quietly grooming local youths to become jihadists, not openly at the Islamic centre or the mosque but through personal connections among a group of friends and brothers.
�쏦e was like the guru of a sect who captivated some weak-minded young men and the seduced them into horrific acts of indiscriminate barbarity,�� Munell said.
The mayor is now trying to heal the wounds in his community.
�쏧 hope people here can be emotionally intelligent enough to distinguish between the Daesh [Islamic State] jihadists and the Muslim community. The Islamic groups here want good relations and to play a part in society. Daesh wants to divide us and disrupt our lives. They don�셳 want us at the beach, at football stadiums, at Las Ramblas. We must fight them by continuing to go to those places and by continuing to play football with our Muslim friends. If we don�셳 Daesh is the winner.��
The US government�셲 web of surveillance is vast and interconnected. Now we know just how opaque, inefficient and discriminatory it can be.
As we were reminded again just this week, you can be pulled into the National Security Agency�셲 database quietly and quickly, and the consequences can be long and enduring. Through ICREACH, a Google-style search engine created for the intelligence community, the NSA provides data on private communications to 23 government agencies. More than 1,000 analysts had access to that information.
This kind of data sharing, however, isn�셳 limited to the latest from Edward Snowden�셲 NSA files. It was confirmed earlier this month that the FBI shares its master watchlist, the Terrorist Screening Database, with at least 22 foreign governments, countless federal agencies, state and local law enforcement, plus private contractors.
The watchlist tracks �쐊nown�� and �쐓uspected�� terrorists and includes both foreigners and Americans. It�셲 also based on loose standards and secret evidence, which ensnares innocent people. Indeed, the standards are so low that the US government�셲 guidelines specifically allow for a single, uncorroborated source of information �� including a Facebook or Twitter post �� to serve as the basis for placing you on its master watchlist.
Of the 680,000 individuals on that FBI master list, roughly 40% have �쐍o recognized terrorist group affiliation��, according to the Intercept. These individuals don�셳 even have a connection �� as the government loosely defines it �� to a designated terrorist group, but they are still branded as suspected terrorists.
The absurdities don�셳 end there. Take Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a population under 100,000 that is known for its large Arab American community �� and has more watchlisted residents than any other city in America except New York.
These eye-popping numbers are largely the result of the US government�셲 use of a loose standard �� so-called �쐒easonable suspicion�� �� in determining who, exactly, can be watchlisted.
Reasonable suspicion is such a low standard because it requires neither �쐁oncrete evidence�� nor �쐇rrefutable evidence��. Instead, an official is permitted to consider �쐒easonable inferences�� and �쐔o draw from the facts in light of his/her experience��.
Consider a real world context �� actual criminal justice �� where an officer needs reasonable suspicion to stop a person in the street and ask him or her a few questions. Courts have controversially held that avoiding eye contact with an officer, traveling alone, and traveling late at night, for example, all amount to reasonable suspicion.
This vague criteria is now being used to label innocent people as terrorism suspects.
Moreover, because the watchlist isn�셳 limited to known, actual terrorists, an official can watchlist a person if he has reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is a suspected terrorist. It�셲 a circular logic �� individuals can be watchlisted if they are suspected of being suspected terrorists �� that is ultimately backwards, and must be changed.
The government�셲 self-mandated surveillance guidance also includes loopholes that permit watchlisting without even showing reasonable suspicion. For example, non-citizens can be watchlisted for being associated with a watchlisted person �� even if their relationship with that person is entirely innocuous. Another catch-all exception allows non-citizens to be watchlisted, so long as a source or tipster describes the person as an �쐃xtremist��, a �쐌ilitant��, or in similar terms, and the �쐁ontext suggests a nexus to terrorism��. The FBI�셲 definition of �쐍exus��, in turn, is far more nebulous than they�셱e letting on.
Because the watchlist designation process is secret, there�셲 no way of knowing just how many innocent people are added to the list due to these absurdities and loopholes. And yet, history shows that innocent people are inevitably added to the list and suffer life-altering consequences. Life on the master watchlist can trigger enhanced screening at borders and airports; being on the No Fly List, which is a subset of the larger terrorist watchlist, can prevent airline travel altogether. The watchlist can separate family members for months or years, isolate individuals from friends and associates, and ruin employment prospects.
Being branded a terrorism suspect also has far-reaching privacy implications. The watchlist is widely accessible, and government officials routinely collect the biometric data of watchlisted individuals, including their fingerprints and DNA strands. Law enforcement has likewise been directed to gather any and all available evidence when encountering watchlisted individuals, including receipts, business cards, health information and bank statements.
Watchlisting is an awesome power, and if used, must be exercised prudently and transparently.
The standards for inclusion should be appropriately narrow, the evidence relied upon credible and genuine, and the redress and review procedures consistent with basic constitutional requirements of fairness and due process. Instead, watchlisting is being used arbitrarily under a cloud of secrecy.
A watchlist saturated with innocent people diverts attention from real, genuine threats. A watchlist that disproportionately targets Arab and Muslim Americans or other minorities stigmatizes innocent people and alienates them from law enforcement. A watchlist based on poor standards and secret processes raises major constitutional concerns, including the right to travel freely and not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law.
Indeed, you can�셳 help but wonder: are you already on the watchlist?
It�셲 rare for someone who makes TV documentaries to become the subject of one. But earlier this year, Tom Hanks hosted a tribute show called Ken Burns: America�셲 Storyteller. Colleagues, historians and even presidents praised the work of a film-maker who has consistently encouraged Americans to look to their past.
Burns made his name with The Civil War in 1990, analysing historical divisions in the US from 1861-65. Now, he burnishes his supremacy among factual film-makers by tackling the second great nation-splitting conflict that occurred exactly a century later.
The Vietnam War �� co-directed by Burns and his regular collaborator, Lynn Novick �� has the advantage over The Civil War of being able to feature personal testimony and TV news footage but otherwise repeats the virtues of his earlier series: authoritative commentary, exhaustive research and scrupulous negotiation of disputed facts.
Even so, the US�셲 intervention on behalf of south Vietnam against the communist regime in the north created rifts in US society �� between left and right, young and old �� that still affect politics and culture today, making this the most contentious project Burns has ever attempted.
Such is the breadth of analysis here that Burns suggests the roots of the conflict began even before the story he told in The Civil War: the opening episode (of 10) is date-stamped ��1858-1961��. Viewers�� double-take at that number 18 is soothed by a typically erudite explanation of the way French colonial ambitions in south-east Asia established faultlines that shaped the US�셲 later intervention.
A key insight in the opening episode comes from a retired CIA operative who argues that, when the US initially intervened on behalf of the French, it fatally assumed an overlap between De Gaulle�셲 imperialist ambition and the US�셲 anti-communist paranoia. Vietnamese resistance to French interests, the old spook says, should in retrospect have been seen �쏿s the end of the colonial era, not the start of a cold war��.
The early programmes could have done more (especially for an international audience) to explain the toxin of anti-communism in the US at the time: there is no mention of the red-hunts of Senator McCarthy, which surely did as much to create the context for the US�셲 misjudgment as a mistaken solidarity with French aims.
Burns and Novick are noted for the even-handedness of their histories and here, the impartiality crucially extends to Vietnamese testimony. During a sequence on a surprise US military setback early in the conflict, a former north Vietnamese guerrilla fighter remembers: �쏤rom that moment, we were no longer scared of the enemy.��
As always in Burns�셲 work, there�셲 a sense of days of conversations edited down to killer lines. A diplomat recalls US commander General Westmoreland boasting that he was killing 10 Vietnamese for every one American casualty, and being told: �쏝ut Westy, Americans don�셳 care about the 10, they care about the one.��
The speakers are captioned with their roles at the time: �쏯eil Sheehan, journalist��; �쏫arl Marlantes, marine.�� Those intros omit to say that these witnesses went on to write definitive accounts of the war �� Sheehan�셲 A Bright Shining Lie, Marlantes�� Matterhorn �� but this literary hinterland explains the high quality of their contributions. �쏻e thought we were an exception to history: the Americans,�� says Sheehan. �쏻e thought we would never fight a wrong war.��
In any history of conflict, the dead must also speak, and this happens extraordinarily in the third and fourth parts. An elderly US woman recalls how she once read to her young son, who was obsessed with war stories, the pre-Agincourt speech from Shakespeare�셲 Henry V. Her boy, Denton Crocker Jr, went into the breach in Vietnam. We know at once from the wet glint in her eyes that he didn�셳 come safe home, but the story of the 19-year-old�셲 sacrifice in a war that Americans soon disowned is wrenchingly told through his family�셲 memories, intercut with battle footage from the first war fought on television.
Among the illustrations is a Christmas message the Crockers recorded for a local TV station that was giving troops�� families the chance to say a festive hello to the boys over there. The inclusion of this astonishing clip is a testimony to the archive research that is the meat of any Burns piece. Treasures here include Vietnamese propaganda paintings of plummeting US helicopters and, in another impressive section, colour footage from Kennedy home movies, showing JFK preparing for a TV interview on Vietnam. A fragment of news film catches a wounded US soldier flashing at the camera a look of pleading despair that seems to implore the folks at home to resist this war. As often in the series, seconds of screen-time hint at months of work.
Even the musical score is lovingly done: subtle new compositions by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, avoiding the obvious emotional manipulation of Hollywood soundtracks, are interspersed with period songs from politically committed songwriters such as Bob Dylan and Paul Simon.
Occasionally, Burns�� and Novick�셲 approach may be too pure. Aiming for neutrality, Peter Coyote�셲 narration (of a script by historian Geoffrey C Ward) sometimes succumbs to stentorian monotony. And a preference for specially recorded interviews means the directors deny themselves the use, except in voiceover precis, of the revelations in The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S McNamara, the 2003 documentary by Errol Morris in which the US defence secretary responsible for escalating US involvement in Vietnam gave an extraordinary self-flagellating account of his errors.
Vietnam is a rare war for which Britain (thanks to Harold Wilson) didn�셳 sign up, so UK viewers watch with a historical disinterest that could never be the case for any American. But The Vietnam War means that students of US history are �� for the second time �� indebted to Burns for the far better essays they will now be able to write �� and so too are viewers everywhere: these are TV histories that will stand for ever in the history of TV.
The Vietnam War starts on BBC4 tonight at 9pm.
In a series of coordinated strikes, explosive devices were detonated on three underground trains and a bus travelling through central London during the morning rush hour.
Last night it was feared the death toll could rise, with the explosions leaving many people seriously injured.
Police denied that they had recovered any unexploded devices. But a source told The Guardian that three controlled explosions had been carried out on "suspect devices".
Furthermore Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of the CIA's counter-terrorism centre, told The Guardian that "two unexploded bombs" were recovered as well as "mechanical timing devices".
Emergency services rushed to east, west and central London as the bombs went off in sequence and without warning over a 50-minute period.
The first device exploded at 8.51am on a Circle line train between Aldgate East and Liverpool Street stations. Seven people were killed.
At 8.56am a second device exploded on a train between King's Cross and Russell Square, killing 21 people.
At 9.17am there was another blast on a train at Edgware Road station which blew a hole through a wall into another train on an adjoining platform. Two other trains were affected and seven people were killed.
At 9.47am a fourth blast blew the top off a doubledecker bus in Tavistock Square, central London, possibly killing more than a dozen people.
As the emergency operation swung into operation, the tube and bus network was shut down and ordinary Londoners began a desperate effort to help the terrified and the injured. Passengers, their faces bloodied, blackened and cut, were comforted by underground staff and passersby. Many rushed from offices and shops to help paramedics.
Witnesses described scenes of devastation. Geraldine Formon, who was in Russell Square, said: "I saw at least five people jump from the top deck of the bus. Half of it was blown away. They were jumping on to the street to escape. It was such a big explosion and the bus was packed as the tube was closed. People were covered with dust and debris."
Jackie Head, who was travelling on the King's Cross train, said the effect had been instantaneous. "Suddenly there was a massive bang, the train jolted. There was immediately smoke everywhere and it was hot and everybody panicked. People thought they were just going to suffocate."
Intelligence and anti-terrorist officials said last night there was little doubt that a group affiliated to or inspired by al-Qaida had carried out the attacks.
Tony Blair last night praised the "stoicism and resilience" of Londoners in the face of yesterday's onslaught on the capital's transport system by bombers he implied were Islamist terrorists.
"We know these people act in the name of Islam but we also know the vast and overwhelming majority of Muslims here and abroad are decent and law-abiding people who abhor this act of terrorism," he said in a televised statement from Downing Street.
Last night Jack Straw, the foreign secretary underlined this when he told a TV interview: "There's an assumption that this is an al-Qaida-based organisation. It has the hallmarks of an al-Qaida-based organisation and also its ruthlessness. News of the bombings was relayed to Mr Blair at the G8 summit in Gleneagles. After reading a joint statement from the G8 leaders, he rushed to London for meetings with security chiefs.
In the afternoon, as Mr Blair chaired a meeting of Cobra - the top-level emergency group - an Islamist website posted a statement claiming the attacks had been carried out by a European cell of al-Qaida. A body calling itself the Secret Organisation of the al-Qaida Jihad in Europe said the attacks were in retaliation for Britain's involvement in US-led operations. The statement, which could not be immediately confirmed, said: "Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern and western quarters."
Scotland Yard said the four devices had been "conventional explosives", not containing chemical or biological material, but could not initially say what size the devices were, whether they had been carried by suicide bombers or whether they had been left in packages on the trains and the bus.
The deputy assistant Met commissioner, Brian Paddick, said: "This clearly was a callous attack ... deliberately designed to kill and injure innocent members of the public."
Mr Paddick said the security level in London had been high: "We are content that the security level was appropriate, notwithstanding the G8 summit."
He said there were 1,500 Met officers in Scotland, guarding the G8 summit and 31,000 officers in London.
Mr Paddick said the emergency services had rehearsed for such a scenario and that the plans had worked as they should have done. He said there was no intelligence about other devices but he warned people to be vigilant.
While concentrating on the emergency response and the effort to catch the bombers, Scotland Yard also activated long-established plans to reassure the public, especially ethnic minority groups who fear they may become targets.
Senior community figures were alerted immediately and members of Muslim groups were called to an urgent meeting. The Guardian has learned that within hours of the attacks, 30,000 abusive and threatening emails were sent to the Muslim Council of Britain's website.
Ken Livingstone, London's mayor, was in Singapore celebrating London's successful Olympic bid but last night returned to London. In a statement he said: "This was not a terrorist attack against the mighty and the powerful. It was not aimed at presidents or prime ministers. It was aimed at ordinary, working-class Londoners, black and white, Muslim and Christian, Hindu and Jew, young and old.
"It was an indiscriminate attempt to slaughter, irrespective of any considerations for age, for class, for religion, or whatever."
He added: "That isn't an ideology, it isn't even a perverted faith - it is just an indiscriminate attempt at mass murder and we know what the objective is. They seek to divide Londoners. They seek to turn Londoners against each other."
It is known that Scotland Yard had previously intercepted up to eight attempts to cause a terrorist atrocity in the UK. A police source told the Guardian that the attacks were "not on the intelligence radar".
The source said there were believed to have been up to 40 people on board the bus that exploded at Tavistock Square, but it is still not known how many people died in that blast, or whether a suicide bomber was among them.
One theory is that a bomber may have been on his way to a tube station, or the bus bomb may have been planned to cause maximum panic when people flocked to buses after the tube was evacuated.
The heinous terror attack in the heart of Istanbul, targeting more than 500 guests celebrating New Year�셲 Eve in a popular nightclub on the Bosphorus, marked the peak of a series of massacres that has shaken Turkey to its core over the past year. These have partly been attacks against security forces claimed by offshoots of the Kurdistan Workers�� party (PKK); and partly attacks by jihadi groups, imported from Syria.
The bloodbath has now been claimed by Islamic State. But �� and it is a big but �� there was a particular significance to the target. Jihadi terror has previously targeted Kurds, Alevis and leftists in Turkey, leaving hundreds dead. But, for the first time, a venue representing the secular lifestyle of the urban upper-middle classes was chosen. And the attack came at a critical time when Turkey�셲 ruling AKP party had made the basic secular tenet of republican Turkey vulnerable.
Weeks before New Year�셲 Eve, banners were hung by pro-government Islamist organisations in Turkey�셲 cities, telling people that �쏮uslims don�셳 celebrate Christmas��, followed by photos depicting groups of young men in local dress, chasing Santa Claus with guns and knives.
The icing on the cake was the sermon by Turkey�셲 powerful directorate of religious affairs (Diyanet) �� which represents the pious Sunni majority (roughly 70% of Turkey�셲 population), though it is financed by all taxpayers.
The statement told Turks not to waste money on new year celebrations. Secular Turks saw it as an undue intrusion on their lifestyles. But the sermon had already encouraged widespread hate speech on social media in the final days of 2016, including death threats towards those planning to celebrate New Year�셲 Eve. (For this reason, Mehmet S철nmez, the head of Diyanet, is now being asked to resign by the pro-Kurdish HDP party for �쐇ncitement to hatred��, probably to no avail.)
Remarkably, no minister or bureaucrat has resigned; nor were any removed from their posts, despite the fact that the death toll of the seemingly endless series of terror attacks since July 2015 �� when the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an terminated peace talks with the PKK Kurdish militant group in reaction to PKK-linked violence �� has risen to nearly 1,800, out of which more than 600 are civilians. The government�셲 arrogant disregard of calls for resignations raises suspicions that the AKP will never leave power peacefully, adding to the tension felt by many Turkish people.
While Turkey has seen several mass killings over the past 18 months, it was during the second half of 2016 that the acts of terror somehow became routine: while the PKK targeted security forces en masse, jihadi terror crept into major urban areas. The pattern clearly shows that the state�셲 intelligence network is now at its weakest.
Observers claim there is a correlation with a massive purge of the security apparatus that Erdo휓an launched before the failed coup of July 2015. The ruling AKP blamed that exclusively on military officers affiliated with Fethullah G체len, a reclusive cleric based in Pennsylvania, although outside experts largely question this official narrative. This �쐇nstitutional cleansing�� of otherwise highly qualified officers who were indiscriminately labelled as G체lenists led to hasty replacements. The suspicions are that their posts were filled by recruits sympathetic to jihadi movements, or, at best, people unqualified for the job. The Turkish state�셲 security deficit leaves the country vulnerable to further acts of destruction.
The terror in Istanbul left few in doubt over the connection with Syria. Less than 24 hours after the massacre, it was Numan Kurtulmu힊, the deputy prime minister and spokesman of the AKP government, who said: �쏧t is a message against Turkish cross-border operations. The operations in Syria obviously stirred unease among terror organisations. We will take measures at home and across the border.��
The deadly equation is apparent. Once seen as a �쐒egime changer�� in Syria, Turkey has long been far too supportive of murky elements of radical Islamism, partly in an attempt to realise a neo-Ottoman dream of turning Syria into a Sunni-dominated hinterland and partly to use them in a combat to prevent Syrian Kurds to establish autonomy on the Turkey-Syrian border. And now, Turkey has fully reversed its Syria policy, ceasing its logistical support for the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad, as a result of shrewd Russian moves and the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara.
Turkey will inevitably come into greater conflict with Isis and al-Qaida elements from now on. Murder in Ankara and the bloodbath in Istanbul may only be overtures that tear apart Turkey�셲 already explosive social faultlines. The battle of al-Bab, and the imminent siege of Idlib, both very close to the Turkish border, promise more trouble ahead.
As the literal meaning of the word indicates, terror is a military strategy that hopes to change the political situation by spreading fear rather than by causing material damage. This strategy is almost always adopted by very weak parties, who are unable to inflict much material damage on their enemies. Of course, every military action spreads fear. But in conventional warfare, fear is a byproduct of material losses, and is usually proportional to the force inflicting the losses. In terrorism, fear is the whole story, and there is an astounding disproportion between the actual strength of the terrorists and the fear they manage to inspire.
It is not easy to change the political situation through violence. On the first day of the battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916, 19,000 members of the British army were killed and another 40,000 wounded. By the time the battle ended in November, both sides together had suffered more than a million casualties, which included 300,000 dead. Yet this unimaginable carnage hardly changed the political balance of power in Europe. It took another two years and millions of additional casualties for something finally to snap.
Compared to the Somme offensive, terrorism is a puny matter. Most terrorist attacks kill only a handful of people. In 2002, at the height of the Palestinian terror campaign against Israel, when buses and restaurants were hit every few days, the yearly toll reached 451 dead Israelis. In the same year, 542 Israelis were killed in car accidents. A few terrorist attacks, such as the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, kill hundreds. The 9/11 attacks set a new record, killing nearly 3,000 people. Yet even this is dwarfed by conventional warfare: if you add all the people killed and wounded in Europe by terrorist attacks since 1945 �� including victims of nationalist, religious, leftist and rightist groups �� it will still represent many fewer casualties than in any number of obscure first world war battles, such as the third battle of the Aisne (250,000 casualties) or the 10th battle of the Isonzo (225,000 casualties).
How then can terrorists hope to achieve much? Following an act of terrorism, the enemy continues to have the same number of soldiers, tanks and ships as before. The enemy�셲 communication network, roads and railways are largely intact. Its factories, ports and bases are hardly touched. However, the terrorists hope that even though they can barely dent the enemy�셲 material, power, fear and confusion will cause the enemy to misuse its strength. Terrorists fight like tai-chi masters: they aim to beat the rival with the rival�셲 own power. Thus the French in Algeria in the 1950s were not defeated by the FLN, the National Liberation Front, but by their misguided reaction to FLN terrorism. The American debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan were the result of the Americans misusing their immense power, rather than of al�멡aida flexing its miniature muscles.
Terrorists calculate that when the enraged enemy uses its massive power against them, it will raise a much more violent military and political storm than the terrorists themselves could ever create. During every storm, many unforeseen things happen. Mistakes are made, atrocities are committed, public opinion wavers, questions are asked, neutrals change their stance and the balance of power shifts. The terrorists cannot foretell what the result will be, but they have a much better chance fishing in such troubled waters than when the political sea is calm.
Terrorism is a very unattractive military strategy, because it leaves all the important decisions in the hands of the enemy. Since terrorists cannot inflict serious material damage, all the options the enemy had prior to a terrorist attack are at its disposal afterwards as well, and it is free to choose among them. Armies normally try to avoid such a situation at all costs. When they attack, they seek not to provoke the enemy to action, but rather to reduce the enemy�셲 power to retaliate, and in particular, to eliminate its most dangerous weapons and options. For example, when the Japanese attacked the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, they could be certain about one thing: no matter what the Americans decided to do, they would not be able to send a fleet to south-east Asia in 1942.
Provoking the enemy to action without eliminating any of its weapons or options is an act of desperation, taken only when there is no other way. Whenever it is possible to inflict serious material damage, nobody gives that up in favour of mere terrorism. It would have been madness if, in December 1941, the Japanese had torpedoed a civilian passenger ship in order to provoke the US but left the Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor intact.
People turn to terrorism because they know they cannot wage war, so they opt instead to produce a theatrical spectacle. Terrorists don�셳 think like army generals; they think like theatre producers. The public memory of the 9/11 attacks is evidence of that: if you ask people what happened on 11 September 2001, they are likely to say that al-Qaida destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Yet the attack involved not merely the towers, but two other actions, in particular a successful attack on the Pentagon. Why is it that only a few people take proper notice of that? If the 9/11 operation had been a conventional military campaign, the Pentagon attack would have received most of the attention. In this attack, al�멡aida managed to destroy part of the enemy�셲 central headquarters, killing and wounding senior commanders and analysts. Why is it that public memory gives far more importance to the destruction of two civilian buildings, and the killing of brokers and accountants?
It is because the Pentagon is a relatively flat and unassuming building, whereas the World Trade Center was a tall, phallic totem whose collapse created an immense audiovisual effect. Nobody who saw the images of its collapse will ever forget them. We intuitively understand that terrorism is theatre, and hence we judge it by its emotional rather than material impact. With hindsight, Osama bin Laden would probably have preferred to launch the plane that hit the Pentagon against a more picturesque target, such as the Statue of Liberty. True, few people would have been killed and no military assets would have been destroyed, but just think what a powerful theatrical gesture it would have been.
Like terrorists, those combating terrorism should also think more like theatre producers and less like army generals. Above all, if we want to fight terrorism effectively we must realise that nothing the terrorists do can defeat us. We are the only ones who can defeat ourselves, if we overreact in a misguided way to terrorist provocations.
Terrorists undertake an impossible mission: to change the political balance of power when they have almost no military abilities. To achieve their aim, they present the state with an impossible challenge of its own: to prove that it can protect all its citizens from political violence, anywhere, anytime. The terrorists hope that when the state tries to fulfil this impossible mission, it will reshuffle the political cards, and hand them some unforeseen ace.
True, when the state rises to the challenge of protecting its citizens from political violence, it often succeeds in crushing the terrorists. Hundreds of terrorist organisations have been wiped out over the last few decades by various states. In 2002-04, Israel proved that a terror campaign can be suppressed by brute force. Terrorists know full well that the chances in such a confrontation are against them. But since they are very weak, and have no other military option, they have nothing to lose and much to gain. Once in a while the political storm created by counterterrorist campaigns does benefit the terrorists, which is why the gamble makes sense. A terrorist is akin to a gambler holding a particularly bad hand, who tries to convince his rivals to reshuffle the cards. He cannot lose anything, but he may win everything.
Why should the state agree to reshuffle the cards? Since the material damage caused by terrorism is negligible, states could theoretically do nothing about it, or take strong but discreet measures far from the cameras and microphones. Indeed, they often do exactly that. But every now and then states lose their tempers, and react far too forcefully and publicly, thus playing into the hands of the terrorists.
Why are they so sensitive to terrorist provocations? Because the legitimacy of the modern state is based on its promise to keep the public sphere free of political violence. A regime can withstand terrible catastrophes, and even ignore them, provided its legitimacy is not based on preventing them. On the other hand, a regime may collapse due to a minor problem if it is seen as undermining its legitimacy. In the 14th century the Black Death killed between a quarter and a half of European populations, yet no king lost his throne as a result, even though no king made much of an effort to overcome the plague. Nobody back then thought that preventing plagues was part of a king�셲 job. On the other hand, rulers that allowed religious heresy to spread in their dominions risked losing their crown, and even their head.
Today, a government may turn a blind eye to high levels of domestic and sexual violence, because they do not undermine its legitimacy. In France, for example, more than 1,000 rape cases are reported to the authorities each year, with thousands more unreported cases. Rapists and abusive husbands, however, are not perceived as an existential threat to the state, because, historically, the state did not build itself on the promise to eliminate sexual violence. In contrast, the much rarer cases of terrorism are viewed as a deadly threat, because over the last few centuries modern western states have gradually built their legitimacy on the explicit promise to maintain zero political violence within their borders.
Back in the middle ages, the public sphere was full of political violence. Indeed, the ability to use violence was the entry ticket to the political game, and whoever lacked this ability had no political voice. Not only did numerous noble families retain armed forces, but so did towns, guilds, churches and monasteries. When an abbot died and a dispute arose about the succession, the rival factions �� comprising monks, local strongmen and concerned neighbours �� often used armed force to decide the issue.
Terrorism had no place in such a world. Anybody who was not strong enough to cause substantial material damage was of no consequence. If in 1150 a few Muslim extremists had murdered a handful of civilians in Jerusalem, demanding that the Crusaders leave the Holy Land, the reaction would have been ridicule rather than terror. If you wanted to be taken seriously, you should have at least gained control of a fortified castle or two. Terrorism did not bother our medieval ancestors because they had bigger problems to deal with.
During the modern era, centralised states have gradually reduced the level of political violence within their territories, and in the last few decades western countries have managed to achieve almost zero political violence. Their citizens can struggle for control of towns, corporations, organisations and even of the government itself without any need of brute force. Command of hundreds of billions of euros, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and hundreds of ships, aeroplanes and nuclear missiles passes from one group of politicians to another without a single shot being fired. People have quickly got used to this, and consider it their natural right. Consequently, even sporadic acts of political violence that kill a few dozen people are seen as a deadly threat to the legitimacy and even survival of the state. A small coin in a big empty jar can make a lot of noise.
This is what makes the theatre of terrorism so successful. The state has created a huge space empty of political violence. This huge space acts as a sounding board, amplifying the impact of any armed attack, however small. The less political violence in a particular state, the greater the public shock at an act of terrorism. Killing 17 people in Paris draws far more attention than killing hundreds in Nigeria or Iraq. Paradoxically, then, the very success of modern states in preventing political violence make them particularly vulnerable to terrorism. An act of terror that would have gone unnoticed in a medieval kingdom can rattle much stronger modern states to their very core.
The state has stressed so many times that it will not tolerate political violence within its borders that it has no alternative but to see any act of terrorism as intolerable. The citizens, for their part, have become used to zero political violence, so the theatre of terror incites in them visceral fears of anarchy, making them feel as if the social order is about to collapse. After centuries of bloody struggles, we have crawled out of the black hole of violence, but we feel that the black hole is still there, patiently waiting to swallow us again. A few gruesome atrocities and we imagine that we are falling back in.
In order to assuage these fears, the state is driven to respond with its own theatre of security. The most efficient answer to terrorism might be good intelligence and clandestine action against the networks of money that feed terrorism. But this is not something citizens can see on television. Once its citizens have seen the terrorist drama of the World Trade Center collapsing, the state feels compelled to stage an equally spectacular counterdrama, with even more fire and smoke. So instead of acting quietly and efficiently, it unleashes a mighty storm, which fulfils the terrorists�� most cherished dreams.
Yet what about nuclear terrorism or bioterrorism? What if the doomsday prophets are correct, and terrorist organisations will acquire weapons of mass destruction, which could cause widespread material damage on a par with conventional warfare? If and when this comes to pass, the state as we know it will become outdated. However, terrorism as we know it will also cease to exist, like a parasite that dies along with its host.
If tiny organisations representing a handful of fanatics could destroy entire cities and kill millions, there will no longer be a public sphere free of political violence. Politics and society will undergo radical transformations. It is hard to know how political struggles will be conducted then, but they will certainly be very different from the terror and counterterror campaigns of the early 21st century. If in 2050 the world is full of nuclear and bio-terrorists, their victims will look back at the western world of today with longing tinged with disbelief: how could people who lived such secure lives nevertheless have felt so threatened?

I know what it�셲 like to feel the fear of battle. To be constantly looking over my shoulder and thinking every sound might be a bomb or a bullet. When I served in Afghanistan in 2009 I felt that fear, but I made a choice to serve in the army and I knew I could come home to safety at the end of my tour. For people living in the border regions of Pakistan their homes may not be a place of safety for much longer. A familiar fear could be about to return to the skies overhead.
Donald Trump is threatening to bring back the drone strikes that brought terror to the country for more than a decade. In doing this he is gambling with the lives of innocent people as diplomatic bargaining chips to punish the Pakistan government. Our prime minister should refuse to play any part.
I am deeply concerned by our country�셲 tangled, and largely secret, involvement in the US drone programme. As an MP, it is my job to hold the government to account. Yet parliament has been given no role in scrutinising the UK�셲 role, and to date the government has refused to disclose the drone guidance that contains the UK�셲 policy. This must change. The use of lethal force is the most powerful action a state can take against a person. In a democracy, such policies must be published. How else can we can we know if they are lawful or justified? How else can we know what is being done in our name?
Publication of this guidance is more urgent than ever because mounting evidence suggests the UK works hand-in-glove with the expanding US drone programme. It has been reported that British bases provide crucial intelligence and operational support in target location; and British intelligence personnel on the ground in countries all around the world provide vital human intelligence helping the US identify targets for deadly drone strikes. British pilots also fly US drones from the same seats as their American counterparts who pull the trigger on strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It will take strength to untangle our involvement in America�셲 unlawful drone programme. But untangle ourselves we must. Far from being an effective tool in the �쐗ar on terror��, the use of drones outside areas of armed conflict devastates communities and fuels recruitment of the very terrorists the drones are meant to target. Terrorist organisations capitalise on the fear of drones and the resentment caused by the countless civilians killed by this �쐏recise�� technology.
We are told by our governments on both sides of the Atlantic that the bombs are �쐔argeted�� only at terrorists. But all the evidence tells us that this is not true. I have spoken before about how close I once came to making the terrible mistake of shooting a civilian in Afghanistan. I know how difficult it is to make these calls from a few hundred metres; it is almost impossible from a few thousand feet.
Analysis by the human rights charity Reprieve and its partner organisation, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, in Pakistan, found that on average it takes the US three attempts to kill an intended target; and in at least two-thirds of strikes, the missiles hit the wrong place and kill the wrong people. Drones may be precise, but it appears that they are precisely killing innocent people. Many civilians have lost their lives in the attempts by the US to assassinate terrorists: for example, in attempts to eliminate the current head of al-Qaida, 76 children and 29 adults have been killed; in attempts to take out four men in Pakistan, 221 people, including 103 children, have been killed �� three of those targets are still alive, and the fourth died of hepatitis.
Trump�셲 ramping up of rhetoric against Pakistan should concern us all. But it should worry Theresa May in Downing Street more than most. The dangers of drones returning to Pakistan are obvious not only to the innocent civilians who will once again live under constant terror, but also for our reputation as a country that proudly protects high standards in the field of battle. Our leaders should not allow themselves to be drawn into the diplomatic game Trump is playing with people�셲 lives.

Those injured in Monday night�셲 terrorist attack in Finsbury Park are all out of critical care, the Metropolitan police has said.
Nine people were taken to hospital after a man believed to be Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, drove into worshippers near the Muslim Welfare House mosque. Seven were still receiving treatment in hospital earlier on Tuesday.
Makram Ali, 51, who had collapsed before the attack, died at the scene. Police are still investigating whether his death was linked to the incident. Many of the injured had rushed to help Ali.

The attack on Manchester Arena, claimed by Islamic State, is the deadliest to have hit Britain since the 7/7 bombings and, what�셲 more, it targeted children and teenagers. It is reported that the perpetrator, Salman Abedi, had recently returned from a three-week stay in Libya, where his parents now reside.
While Abedi might represent a new terrorist profile �� a UK national with possible connections to broader terrorist networks based in Libya �� his attack is part of a larger trend that has confronted Europe since 2012. In this new wave, terrorist operatives are both capable �� witness the suitcase bomb packed with explosives used in Brussels �� and very difficult to detect, given our lack of �쐃yes and ears�� on key jihadist arenas such as Syria and Libya. In the past, it was usually one or the other: capable terrorists who operated within well-known hierarchies that the security services could monitor and disrupt; or loners who stayed beneath the radar but didn�셳 have the knowhow to execute sophisticated attacks.
It�셲 possible, therefore, that the Manchester attack binds together the terror threat in the UK with long-running challenges in Libya. Extremist groups of many stripes have taken advantage of governance failures and the mismanagement of the post-Gaddafi transition �� and, it must be said, western governments�� lack of interest after he was toppled in 2011.
The weakness of the central authorities �� which fractured into two rival governments in 2014 before being joined by a third UN-backed government in 2016 �� led directly to the breakdown of the rule of law, security vacuums, corruption, economic stagnation and the empowerment of violent and unaccountable militia, including jihadist groups.
The 32 militants who laid siege to the In Amenas gas plant in 2013, killing 40 people, are believed to have crossed into Algeria from Libya. Likewise, the gunman who killed 38 tourists on the beachfront in Sousse, Tunisia, reportedly trained at an Isis base near Sabratha. The two gunmen killed in the attack on the Bardo museum in Tunis in 2015 were graduates of that same camp.
But it was in central Libya, around the former Gaddafi stronghold of Sirte, that Isis built up its north African proto-state. The coastal town had been deserted by the transitional government, and the militia that had run amok there were eventually co-opted by Isis. Libya was seen by the Isis leadership in Iraq and Syria as a fallback zone and, with its oil riches, as �쏿 well of resources that cannot dry��.
However, in May 2016, after two of its suicide bombers struck forces from Misrata �� the next major town along the coast �� Misratans fought back and within months ejected Isis from Sirte. Moreover, widespread revulsion over Isis�셲 brutal methods and its �쐄oreign�� governance meant the group hadn�셳 managed to generate a social base.
Still, Isis is far from a spent force in Libya. Key commanders are known to have escaped and regrouped south of Sirte. In fact, a month after Sirte was �쐋iberated��, American stealth bombers struck two Isis encampments 30 miles outside the city, where militants were �쏿ctively plotting�� attacks on Europe. And an Italian intelligence document has suggested that Isis fighters seek to enter Europe by exploiting a scheme designed to treat injured soldiers aligned with the Libyan government.
Of course, if planned in Libya, an attack such as that in Manchester would signal to the world �� and also its keenest rival, a resurgent al-Qaida �� that Isis in Libya lives on, after Sirte, albeit in a different form.
The crisis in Libya is intensifying. On the political side, there was talk of a breakthrough earlier this month, when the heads of the two main rival camps met for face-to-face talks, brokered by the United Arab Emirates. However, there has been no word since then of any agreement, and the situation on the ground has escalated significantly.
In a battle last week near the south-western Libyan town of Sebha, an estimated 141 people were killed, with reports emerging of mass executions and beheadings. Conflagrations of this nature could potentially tip the country into full-fledged civil war.
These developments are a boon to Isis and other extremists. Not only do such groups blossom in situations of conflict and social turmoil, but the underlying drivers of radicalisation become entrenched. In the wake of the Sousse attack, the Tunisian ambassador to the UK observed that radicalisation will only be fuelled by the economic hardship resulting from a decline in tourism. In Libya, with youth unemployment approaching 40%, there can be little surprise that some of its estimated 250,000-350,000 armed men have fallen in with radical groups.
Even the challenge of migration can be understood in economic terms. Leaders from the Tuareg, Tebu and Awlad Suleiman ethnic groups have stated that they would be willing to stem the flood of migrants transiting through southern Libya, in exchange for aid and development from Europe.
Irrespective of whether the Manchester bombing is traced to Libya, meaningful re-engagement by the UK is long overdue. Through groups such as Isis, Libya�셲 most urgent problems �� from warring governments to humanitarian crises �� have the potential to become our own.
It is not clear why these dates were chosen. A December 2016 cut-off excludes the Qu챕bec City mosque attack from the list. There were more than 78 terrorist attacks in that period �� the ones selected by the White House are almost exclusively those linked �� or rumoured to be linked �� to Islamic State. The White House text is reproduced in bold and its errors have been kept.
Global media organisations including the Guardian, BBC, CNN and Fox News were among those who covered this story.

The White House surely cannot include the Paris attacks in the �쐌ost�� on this list that it thinks were under-reported. It omits the names of three of the 11 men involved in the attack, and spells Chakib Akrouh�셲 name wrong. The death toll for the attacks stands at 130.
This appears to refer to the attack on the priest Piero Parolari.

The Berlin Christmas market attack dominated the news agenda in the run-up to Christmas.
Shortly before 11am on Saturday, military bomb disposal experts swooped on a terraced house in Manchester. Such sights are the new reality, as the city begins adjusting to life on the front line of the war on terror.
Even as daylight broke over Manchester Arena on Tuesday following the attack, investigators had concluded that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was no solitary actor, no lone wolf. The 22-year-old required considerable support in carrying out the arena attack, which was timed to cause carnage during the heady moments when the pop star Ariana Grande finished her encore.
The first clue came in the device itself. Forensic analysts realised it had been crafted with cunning. The shrapnel was evenly spaced to inflict maximum damage and it had a back-up detonation system. Building an effective bomb is tricky. The Manchester attack was the first time Islamist terrorists have successfully used explosives in Britain since 2005.
The second clue emerged less than 24 hours after Abedi killed 22 people and injured 116. Intelligence from the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre confirmed that there was the risk of a follow-up attack. Theresa May announced the threat level was being raised to critical, its highest, signalling that another terrorist atrocity was expected imminently.
Put simply, the bomb maker was either still at large or Abedi had distributed more devices to his co-conspirators. The race to trace the terror network had begun.
Six days after the attack, it is a race the police feel they are winning. Manchester�셲 chief constable Ian Hopkins confirmed the investigation had made �쐓ignificant progress�� dismantling the network behind Britain�셲 worst terror attack in more than a decade. Hours earlier, just before midday, the threat level had been downgraded to severe.
Even so, Britain�셲 most senior counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley �� the Met�셲 assistant commissioner for specialist operations �� said more arrests will follow. Police held two more suspects in dawn raids on Saturday, with 11 men now being questioned. The true size and scope of Abedi�셲 network has still been not fully established.
So far, 14 locations across Greater Manchester have been searched. One Cheetham Hill home raided on Saturday had its doors blown off before being stormed by police. Another key building is Granby House, a 1908 red-brick building close to the city�셲 Piccadilly station. Here, last weekend, inside a one-bedroom apartment, investigators believe Abedi may have helped to assemble the bomb�셲 chief components.
The sharp end of the inquiry is focused on Manchester, but even as the net draws tighter on Abedi�셲 cell, the investigation�셲 tentacles are stretching further. Away from the red-brick streets of England�셲 north-west, it has moved to Abedi�셲 Libyan connections and on to the streets of Tripoli and its mishmash of jihadist militias.
Islamic State�셲 claim of responsibility for the attack has prompted the intelligence agencies to scour the identities of senior Isis operatives and foreign fighters holed up in the Syrian and Iraqi cities of Raqqa and Mosul.
Abedi�셲 links to Europe are slowly emerging. German officials are investigating a possible connection to Frankfurt, the largest financial centre on the continent. In the aftermath of the attack, officials in Brussels, an established jihadi hotspot, said there was no link, but that position has since begun to alter.
A paradox of complex counter-terrorism investigations is that the more progress made, the slower and more cumbersome the inquiry can become. Every house raided, each individual arrested creates more leads, and more blind alleys that must be investigated.
Every telephone, handset and computer has now to be meticulously examined by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, each a potentially gigantic source of data.
Sources close to the investigation reveal they have approached technology firms to help access machines, saying they expect to �쏿mass hundreds of electronic devices�� during the investigation into Abedi�셲 terror cell. Greater Manchester Police said they were pursuing 1,500 �쏿ctions��.
�쏷he further it progresses, the more work, the more phones to search through. Investigations can be peculiar things; after the arrest phase is when the real work begins,�� said a source.
Adding to the information flow is the granting of IoC (interception of communications) powers that enable the security services to listen to calls and read emails. A 1,000-strong investigations team, working 14-hour shifts 24/7 has been formed to chase leads and evaluate data.
A primary focus of the investigation for several days has been tracking the forensic footprint of the bomb itself. A team of Metropolitan Police officers has mounted a large-scale financial investigation into where, how and by whom the device�셲 chemicals were acquired, as well as ascertaining if the men who are in custody can be linked to such transactions. The bomb contained TATP �� triacetone triperoxide �� the same explosive as was used in the November 2015 attacks in Paris, the Brussels attack in March 2016 and the July 2005 London attacks, and a high explosive frequently favoured by terrorists because its ingredients are readily found at chemists or hardware stores.
Detectives are also analysing database algorithms designed to spot terrorist tradecraft and terabytes of chatter that record the various aliases and movements of �쐓ubjects of interest��. Much of this requires UK officials liaising bilaterally with European police forces or issuing requests to Europol, Interpol and American officials in relation to Libya.
Europe�셲 colossal databases are pivotal, principally the Schengen Information System, which includes details of criminals along with 8,000 terror suspects and which last year was used by UK police 58,694 times an hour.
As police close in on Abedi�셲 network, its international reach means that other characters have emerged that may be of interest. Among these is a shadowy logistics expert based in Brussels known only as Obaida and who, it is believed, may have acted as a crucial cog in the support network of an active Manchester cell over several years, enabling terrorists to flit through European capitals and on to Libya and Syria and back.
Greater Manchester police have been cooperating with forces and secret services in Belgium, and US security officials have said Abedi�셲 bomb suggested a �쐋evel of sophistication�� that implied its maker had foreign training.
Immediately after the Manchester attack, Belgium�셲 Threat Analysis Co-ordination Body said that, after an initial intelligence analysis, a link between Belgium and the Manchester bombing had not been found. But by Friday a spokesman for OCAM was unwilling to repeat that position and declined to explain.
Obaida first came to the attention of the British security services during an investigation into a friend of Abedi�셲, Abdalraouf Abdallah, 23. Twelve months ago, Abdallah, a Libyan refugee who lived 15 minutes�� walk from Abedi in Manchester, was sentenced to five and a half years for terrorism offences. During the trial, Obaida was named as a key figure �쐄acilitating the movements of terrorists across mainland Europe��.
In a pre-sentencing hearing judgment, Lord Justice Treacy described Abdallah as being �쏿ctive in a terrorist group based in Manchester in 2014��.
Treacy�셲 judgment added: �쏛bdallah organised the terrorist activities of the Manchester group. The group used shared contacts to facilitate movement through Europe to the Syrian border. It was also involved in arrangements for the purchase and supply of weapons.��
A second leg of the Brussels investigation is examining whether Abedi had links to the so-called �쐌an in the hat�� caught on cameras at Brussels airport shortly before it was bombed, believed to be the Belgian Mohamed Abrini. Abrini visited Manchester in 2015 and has since been charged with involvement in the Paris terrorist attacks.
In Germany, separate investigations into Abedi are also ongoing. The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) of North Rhein-Westphalia is scouring CCTV footage from Dusseldorf airport where Abedi, on his way back from Libya to Manchester, spent four hours just days before his attack.
German authorities describe their investigation as �쐇ntensive and urgent�� after it emerged that Abedi had visited the country in 2015, spending time in Frankfurt.
Both Frankfurt and Dusseldorf are home to more than a thousand suspected Islamists, and counter-intelligence experts from the police and BKA are looking into any potential contacts Abedi may have had with radical German Islamists. Dusseldorf is just 150 miles from Brussels, where Obaida was last known to be based. A possible German chapter of the Abedi network may yet surface.
Eleven days before a general election it was highly likely that the fallout from the atrocity would become politicised. There have been accusations that budget cuts to community policing had left Manchester without the intelligence needed to keep it safe.
Manchester�셲 mayor, Andy Burnham, waded into the debate on Saturday, suggesting the public would be prepared to pay more to bolster police numbers. The city has lost 2,000 officers since 2010.
Resources also determine the efficacy of the security services. The home secretary Amber Rudd has admitted Abedi was known to intelligence agencies �쐕p to a point�� but following a single terror suspect covertly 24 hours a day requires a huge team of up to 36 intelligence officers. Tough decisions are required over who gets the full surveillance treatment. Wherever Abedi started in the prioritisation system, he ended up at the bottom of the list, and the security services are looking into whether there was �쏿ctionable�� intelligence that may have been ignored.
Various calls have also been made to review Britain�셲 entire counter-terror infrastructure, even including demands for the reintroduction of internment.
Predictably, yet more scrutiny has fallen on Prevent, the government�셲 counter-radicalisation strategy. Prevent has been dogged with claims that its activities are sowing mistrust and fear in the Muslim community. Abedi was reported to Prevent following concerns over his radical views long before his attack.
Fiyaz Mughal, founder of the anti-extremist organisation Faith Matters, said that the episode further exposed failures of officials to act on indicators of radicalisation. �쏛ssessments by skilled professionals should show up which individuals may be at risk of extremism and violent extremism. It is an exact trajectory that I have seen in cases before. This is a well worn path, sadly.��
Fresh twists lie ahead but the immediate risk of another attack in Manchester appears to have been neutralised, the central protagonists rounded up and detectives increasingly emboldened by the investigation�셲 success. Steadily, police are learning how the device was made.
On Saturday, Rowley, who is also anti-terrorism policy lead for the National Police Chiefs�� Council, implied the initial phase of the investigation was nearing its endgame, yet was canny enough to make room for any unexpected development. �쏻e are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the bomb. There is still much more to do.��
�� This article was amended on 29 May 2017. An earlier version said Theresa May was raising the threat level to critical. This has been corrected to say May announced the threat level was being raised to critical.
It�셲 as if the attack never happened. On the beach outside the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse, sun loungers have been cleaned of blood, floral tributes washed away by the tide and a commemorative sign has been moved to a more discreet place.
But at night, the attack comes to life once more, at least in the head of Karim Sahloul.
Sahloul, 38, a receptionist in the neighbouring Palm Marina hotel, repeatedly relives the memory of braving gunfire to save the life of a British woman who survived five gunshot wounds. �쏷here are nightmares. I can�셳 forget this. I sleep now with sleeping pills.��
The trauma is doubled by the fact that he has lost his job, as hotels across the city close with tourists having deserted Tunisia en masse. The government, scrambling to assure the world it is winning the war with terrorists, has attacked jihadi bases and arrested 160 Sousse suspects. But the jury is out on whether the Islamic State threat is vanquished and the beaches safe.
Sahloul�셲 nightmare began just after midday on a sunny Friday in late June. Through windows of the hotel lobby he saw tourists running off the beach in panic. �쏤irst I thought it must be a tsunami. I didn�셳 hear shots, I didn�셳 understand.��
He ran to the beach and saw the lone black-clad gunman, 23-year-old Seifeddine Rezgui, waving a machine gun.
�쏦e was walking, very easy, he was smiling,�� says Sahloul. By then 38 tourists, 30 of them British, were dead. Sahoul joined an impromptu squadron of beach staff forming a line to block the path of the gunman. When Rezgui ran the other way, later to be shot dead by police, Sahloul ran along the sand to the Marhaba to search for survivors.
There he saw a middle-aged couple in swimsuits, lying side to side, riddled with bullets and apparently dead. �쏷he woman moved her hand. I understood she was alive.��
The woman was 48-year-old Allison Heathcote, described by doctors as the �쐌iracle patient�� after surviving her wounds.
Fighting the fear that the gunman would return, Sahloul picked up a discarded towel and dabbed it on her wounds. She looked up at him and smiled, and he tried to keep her conscious. �쏧t is something we are trained in. I knew it was important to keep her awake.��
She asked for water and he found a plastic water bottle, dabbing her lips, then he asked her questions to keep her talking. �쏧 asked her name. She said: �쁀llison.�� I said: �쁗hen did you come here?�� She said: �쁈 came yesterday.�쇺��
Then came a question that poleaxed him. �쏶he asked what had happened to her husband.��
Inches away lay the body of her husband, Phillip, 53. Sahloul made a snap decision not to tell her the truth, worried the shock might kill her. But he decided not to lie.
�쏧 said: �쁃on�셳 think about your husband. You need to survive.�쇺��
He stayed with her for nearly an hour until medics arrived. One gave him a drip feed to hold while she was moved to a stretcher. He asked about her chances; the doctor said: �쏱ray for her.��
Heathcote was later flown to Britain, where she remains in hospital.
At the time, Sahloul says, he felt no fear, only the urge to help. The trauma came later. �쏧 don�셳 sleep afterwards. I went to the doctor �� I was given three weeks off work.��
He now he faces a new problem as Tunisia�셲 tourist industry has collapsed. With Britain and other countries warning against travel to Tunisia, tour agencies have cancelled bookings and the number of visitors from Britain are predicted to fall this year by 80-90% from the 420,000 who came in 2014.
It is a hammer blow to an already weak economy and last week Sahloul was laid off as his hotel closed. Next door, only a handful of tourists sit amid the rows of sun loungers outside the Marhaba, whose Spanish operator, Riu, said this week it may close the hotel and eight more. Visiting Sousse�셲 hotels these days is an eerie experience, with empty pools, deserted bars and buffets laden with uneaten food.
�쏯inety per cent of this town relies on tourism, directly or indirectly, so now everyone is suffering,�� says Salah Lahjouhi, who has worked in hotel restaurants here for 20 years.
He gestures across the empty sand, where two women in bikinis are the only swimmers: �쏧 can�셳 believe it. I dream one day to open my eyes and find things as usual.��
Driving along the coastal strip, a taxi driver starts counting off the hotels closing, stopping the cab when he reaches 26. He grips the steering wheel. �쏶ousse is dying,�� he says.
The tourist industry knows the problem: �쏷he top priority for the next years will be safety, safety, safety,�� Abdellatif Hamam, director general of the Tunisian National Tourist Office, told Reuters this week. �쏻e cannot afford any more incidents.��
After the attack, the government declared a state of emergency and passed a draconian anti-terrorism law. Three jihadi camps have been raided and a wall is being built along the Libyan border, the main Isis infiltration route.
�쏷he state of emergency has helped us enormously to catch the terrorists,�� says Walid Loukini, media officer at Tunisia�셲 interior ministry. �쏷he ones arrested for the Sousse attack are under investigation. For sure they will go to court and it will be public.��
But the terror threat has yet to be eradicated, with cat-and-mouse battles raging between militants and security forces in border regions. Meanwhile, Isis continues to grow in the chaos of neighbouring Libya.
Rezgui, a Tunisian, was trained in the main Isis camp in western Libya at Sabratha, as were two Tunisian suicide attackers who killed 21 tourists in the capital�셲 Bardo museum three months before.
�쏧sis is impossible for the Tunisian authorities to handle because the threat is mainly based in Libya,�� says David Thomson, a Paris-based terrorism expert. �쏻e cannot say that Tunisia does nothing. Tunisia has struck the jihadis, but they didn�셳 manage to eradicate the threat.��
Some fear the tough new laws will be counter-productive, further alienating unemployed youth in hardscrabble towns such as Ga창four, 60 miles south-east of Tunis, where Rezgui was raised, and driving them into the hands of Isis.
�쏷hese laws may lead to a rise in repression,�� says Amna Guellali of Human Rights Watch. There can be a backlash from the young people who are feeling the heat from these laws.��
One thing that has changed in Sousse is the police presence: It took 40 minutes for officers to arrive on the day of the attack, but now armed officers in black-and-white T-shirts are posted in each hotel, despite the fact that there are fewer and fewer people to guard. More watch over traffic junctions, while a coastguard cutter and gendarmerie on jet skis with red flashing lights patrol the shoreline.
Whether this be enough to lure back the tourists, only time will tell. �쏧 will stay without work for eight months. How I will manage I don�셳 know,�� says Sahloul. �쏛llison is alive, this the important thing.��
The White House has distributed a list of 78 terrorist attacks to support Donald Trump�셲 claim that the media is failing to properly report them.
But the list includes many atrocities that received blanket western media coverage including the Paris Bataclan attacks, the Nice truck killings and the San Bernardino shootings.
Many others including the Sydney siege and Germany�셲 Christmas market attack received wide international coverage.
The list also includes multiple errors and spelling mistakes, including �쏶an Bernadino��, and excludes numerous terror attacks across the Middle East.
The release comes after the US president told military leaders in Tampa, Florida, on Monday that there have been attacks all over Europe but �쐇n many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn�셳 want to report it��. He added: �쏷hey have their reasons, and you understand that,�� but did not expand.
Later the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about specific attacks that had not been reported, to which he replied: �쏻e�셪l provide a list later. There�셲 several instances �� There�셲 a lot of instances that have occurred where I don�셳 think they�셶e gotten the coverage it deserved.��
That list, released to media outlets including the Guardian, included a �쐔imeline�� of domestic and international incidents from September 2014 to December 2016.
Some, such as last year�셲 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and the killing of 129 people in Paris in November 2015, received huge coverage. But officials claimed that �쐌ost�� of the attacks were not adequately reported by western media outlets, CNN reported.
The list hops from Afghanistan to Algeria to Australia but, without explanation, does not mention Israel, where incidents included a bus bombing in Jerusalem last year, carried out by a 19-year-old Palestinian, that injured 20 people.
A December 2016 cut-off also excludes the Qu챕bec City mosque attack from the list, an attack Trump was publicly silent about, despite condemning on Twitter the Louvre attack in Paris several days later.
The murder of British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung in an Australian hostel last year was also included on the list, even though extremism had been ruled out as a motive by both police and the victim�셲 mother.
In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accused Donald Trump of using �쐄ake news�� about her daughter�셲 death to further the �쐏ersecution of innocent people�� by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack.
�쏮y daughter�셲 death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,�� she wrote.
The document also includes spelling mistakes such as �쏿ttaker�� instead of �쏿ttacker�� and �쏡enmakr�� instead of �쏡enmark��.
There have been similar errors in official communications in recent days, including references to Theresa May as �쏷eresa�� and a reference to Malcolm Turnbull as the �쐏resident�� of Australia when it should be �쐏rime minister��.
The catalogue begins with an attack by Abdul Numan Haider, who wounded two police officers in a knife attack in Melbourne in September 2014. It ends with an atrocity involving Anis Amri, who drove a truck into a crowded market in Berlin last December, killing 12 and injuring 48.
Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesperson, claimed that the list demonstrates how terrorist attacks are losing perceived news value because of their frequency. �쏷he real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,�� she said via email.
�쏧f you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they�셱e happening so often �� at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list �� that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did.
�쏷his cannot be allowed to become the �쁭ew normal��, and the President, for one, is not going to be satisfied until the American people are much safer and more secure.��
Earlier, Spicer told reporters travelling on Air Force One that Trump believes attacks are not �쐕nreported�� but �쐕nder-reported��.
He said: �쏦e felt members of the media don�셳 always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered.��
But David Gergen, a political analyst and former adviser to four US presidents, condemned Trump�셲 remarks.
�쏧 think this is one of the most outrageous claims the president has made, among many, because it really says, basically, that the press is not doing its job because it has its own political agenda,�� he told CNN. �쏧t doesn�셳 want you to know the truth about how dangerous terrorism is. It doesn�셳 want to be out there, it�셲 just pulling a leftist agenda on you, which is clearly not true.��
Gergen added: �쏦e engages in these falsehoods without producing any serious evidence. The list includes San Bernardino, as if the press didn�셳 cover that sufficiently. It�셲 just astonishing and it�셲 beneath the dignity of the presidency and I think it tears at the fabric of what holds us together as a people when we can�셳 trust each other, we can�셳 trust the White House, and he�셲 telling us we can�셳 trust the press. This is the way democracies come unravelled.��
Leaders around the world, including Donald Trump, Malcolm Turnbull and Angela Merkel, react to the terrorist bombing in Manchester. They expressed sympathy and solidarity, calling it an attack on young people and freedom
�� Donald Trump says �쁢vil losers�� were behind Manchester attack
For most people, in most places, something like normality resumes. This weekend Britons might be planning a barbecue, watching the FA Cup Final or just hoping to soak up some sun. In Manchester, in a show of almost comic defiance, the Great CityGames are going ahead, so that today, Deansgate will be converted into a sprint track and there�셪l be pole vaulting in Albert Square �� just days after it was packed for a hushed vigil.
But I can�셳 help thinking of what it�셲 like inside those homes where normality vanished on Monday night. I keep thinking of the parents who thought life was just ticking along, and who are suddenly having to contemplate a future without their son or daughter.
I picture the visitors popping in, the endless cups of tea, the red-rimmed eyes or the tears that won�셳 come because the shock is too great. I keep imagining the brother passing the door of his little sister�셲 bedroom, unable to comprehend the silence. I keep thinking of the father who wakes up from a few hours of restless sleep and remembers after a second�셲 delay that, yes, it�셲 true: she�셲 gone.
For the rest of us, the world is turning again. And it is following a familiar rhythm. Lucy Easthope, who helps cities prepare for terror attacks, wrote a fascinating piece on these pages this week, revealing that a lot of what looks spontaneous is in fact planned �� that those I Heart Manchester or Nice or Paris signs don�셳 just appear by themselves, that the appearance of multifaith leaders side-by-side in prayer is no accident. There is a ritual sequence to these things now, right down to the speech from the city leader promising that tolerance and kindness will prevail and that we will not be defeated.
There�셲 one more element to the process that is probably not in Easthope�셲 blueprint, but which is observed as dutifully as all the others. It is the search, after a decent interval, for an explanation. It is the debate about the causes of terrorism.
One camp holds that the men who plant these bombs are driven by loathing for western values, for our freedom and permissive way of life, and especially for the liberty exercised by women. The other argues that the root cause is western foreign policy and our record of armed intervention in Muslim lands. Boiled down, it becomes a battle of who we are versus what we do.
I understand the draw of the latter position, which was staked out in a sober and carefully caveated speech by Jeremy Corbyn today. For one thing, foreign policy clearly plays some role in these horrific events. Listen to the testimony of Jomana Abedi, sister of the Manchester murderer, who said of her brother: �쏦e saw the explosives America drops on children in Syria, and he wanted revenge,�� before adding, rather chillingly: �쏻hether he got that is between him and God.�� Recall the posthumous video released by Mohammad Sidique Khan, ringleader of the 7/7 bombers, in which he cast himself as an avenger for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. And recall too the warnings of Britain�셲 security services, who feared the Iraq war could lead to increased radicalisation.
Besides, such a stance has an appeal beyond the facts. It grants us a degree of control over these acts of catastrophe. It lets us think that we can bring an end to this horror, if only we change tack internationally. We can ensure there are no Manchester tragedies: it�셲 up to us.
The trouble is, the link is not nearly so simple or direct. Talk to those who devote their lives to the study of violent jihadism, reading Isis�셲 propaganda and interviewing its devotees, and a different picture emerges.
For one thing, it�셲 not all about us. Most of jihadism�셲 victims are other Muslims, in the Arab world or in Africa. When they murder and maim Shia Muslims by the hundreds, they�셱e not doing that to punish western foreign policy. When Isis set about the massacre of Yazidi men and the enslavement and mass rape of Yazidi women and girls, it wasn�셳 revenge for western meddling in the Middle East. It takes an oddly Eurocentric view of the world to decide that this is a phenomenon entirely of the west�셲 creation.
Moreover, what might count as western provocation, fuelling jihadism, is not as clear as some might like to think. Many on the left assume it is military intervention that turns young men into jihadis ready to murder pre-teen girls. But I recall my own first encounter with that ideology, back in the 1990s.
I was speaking at a student meeting that was disrupted by loud activists from the extremist al-Muhajiroun group. What were they furious about? The west�셲 failure to take military action over Bosnia. These young men were livid that Britain and the US had not dropped bombs to prevent the massacre at Srebrenica. It proved, they said, that the west held Muslim lives to be cheap.
We know that Salman Abedi was a child of Libyan Islamists, vehemently opposed to Muammar Gaddafi. Imagine혻his rage if the west had heard the dictator�셲 threats to carry out a massacre in Bengazi in 2011 and done nothing. It would be similar to the jihadi venom that�셲 directed at the west for failing to stop Bashar al-Assad from slaughtering Muslims in Syria �� a sentiment that helped win recruits to Islamic State.
The point is, this is an ideology that can rage against western inaction as much as action. When I spoke to Shiraz Maher, a senior research fellow at King�셲 College London who studies radicalisation up close, he put the problem concisely: �쏽ou�셱e damned if you do, and damned if you don�셳.��
Maher suggests that western foreign policy often plays the role of a hook on which jihadis can hang a much larger set of ideological, and theological, motives. In his latest essay for the New Statesman, he quotes one British Isis recruit he interviewed, who told him: �쏻e primarily fight wars due to people being disbelievers. Their drones against us are a secondary issue.��
So it�셲 not clear what a foreign policy designed to soothe rather than inflame jihadi opinion would look like �� or that it would get you very far. Staying out of Muslim countries might seem like the obvious answer, but it offers no guarantees. Not against those who can regard an eight-year-old girl and her friends as �쐁rusaders��, worthy of death for the sin of dancing in a �쐓hameless concert arena��.
Maybe it would be easier to bear if our fate was entirely in our hands, if a life of peace and calm beckoned if only we chose the right path. It would be a comfort, but a false one �� for it would misunderstand the enemy we face.
The horrors of the Boston Marathon explosions have focussed attention on terror attacks in the United States. But how common are they?
The Global Terrorism Database has recorded terror attacks across the world - with data from 1970 covering up to the end of 2011. It's a huge dataset: over 104,000 attacks, including around 2,600 in the US - and its collection is funded by an agency of the US government: the Science and Technology Directorate of the US Department of Homeland Security through a Center of Excellence program based at the University of Maryland.
There's a lot of methodology detailed on the site and several definitions of what is terrorism. At its root, the GTD says that terrorism is:
The data - which excludes 1993 - shows how there are actually fewer attacks now than in the 1970s. There were a total of 207 terrorist attacks in the US between 2001 and 2011. They went down from a high of 40 in 2001 to nine in 2011. The smallest number of attacks occurred in 2006 when the database recorded six. Between 2001 and 2011, it shows a total of 21 fatal terror attacks.
But the other side of that is the more recent attacks have been incredibly deadly - with 9/11 obviously dominating the data. This great post from the Washington Post points this - and more - out. It's based on this report from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, reporting on last year's GTD figures.
The biggest caveat about these figures is that these are all attacks, not necessarily those that cause more loss of life.
This chart of total attacks shows how 9/11 distorts the total figures - comprising 85% of all the terror deaths recorded. Those other peaks? The 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the 1984 wounding peak was the Rajneeshee bioterror attack where restaurants were deliberately contaminated with salmonella. One caveat on the 9/11 figures is the number of wounded - which here is not from teh GTD. As they say:
Very few parts of the US have managed to avoid attacks of one sort or another. We've mapped the database, using CartoDB. Click the image below to explore it.
The data also shows how the nature of those attacks have changed too. As the Post points out: "Bombings have dropped in popularity over the last decade �� accounting for just 27% of the attacks since 2001 �� And, notably, guns have never figured heavily in US terrorist attacks".
As Harry Enten writes, the Boston attack is unusual for a number of reasons:
The final point is a sense of perspective: bad as the number of US attacks are, there are far fewer there than in many countries around the world.
Here are the key findings from the report:
�� The highest proportion of unsuccessful attacks since 1970 occurred in 2011 - four out of nine recorded attacks were unsuccessful
�� From 2001 to 2011 California (40) and New York (19) experienced the most total terrorist attacks against the US homeland
�� The three cities in the United States that experienced the most attacks from 2001 to 2011 were New York City (12), Washington, DC (9) and Los Angeles (8)
�� The most common weapons used in terrorist attacks in the United States from 2001 to 2011 were bombs (53% of all weapons used) and explosives (20% of all weapons used)
�� For the period from 2001 to 2011, biological weapons were tied with firearms as the third most common weapon used in terrorist attacks (both represented 8% of all weapons used). This is due to the anthrax attacks in October 2001
�� From 2001 to 2011, the most common targets of terrorists in the United States were businesses (62 attacks), private citizens and property (59 attacks), and government (43 attacks)
�� The three terrorist organizations with the largest number of attacks on the US from 2001 to 2011 were the Earth Liberation Front (50), the AnimalLiberation Front (34) and al-Qa'ida (4)

Witnesses of the London Bridge and Borough Market attacks have described the horrific events that unfolded shortly after 10pm on a busy Saturday night.
Those caught up in the attack �� many of whom were in central London for dinner, or watching the Champions League final in bars �� described scenes of chaos and horror.
At around 10.08pm on Saturday a white van driving at about 50mph struck pedestrians on London Bridge and then continued toward Borough Market. The van continued down Borough High Street where it crashed outside the Barrow Boy & Banker pub.
Three suspects jumped out of the back door, running towards Borough Market stabbing anyone who got in their way and attacking people in bars and restaurants. Witnesses described desperately throwing bottles and chairs at the attackers in an attempt to stop them.
Witnesses report seeing attackers stabbing people along Stoney Street near the restaurants Brindisa, El Pastor, Roast and Black & Blue. Within eight minutes of the first call to emergency services, officers arrived and shot dead three attackers outside the Wheatsheaf pub. The suspects were wearing what looked like explosive vests but these were later established to be fake.
A man called Mark told the BBC he was taking photographs on London Bridge when he saw the van hitting pedestrians on the bridge.
�쏧t was swerving from side to side and I could see it hitting people and there was a group about 20 or 30 yards in front of me. The van hit those people. At that moment I was doing that calculation of trying to work out which direction should I run.��
Will Heaven, a Spectator journalist, was passing the bridge. He told Sky News: �쏧t was about 10 past 10. I was in the back of an Uber cab driving south over London Bridge.
�쏶uddenly on the left-hand side, on the bridge, there was somebody down on the pavement with a small crowd around them, clearly concerned. I thought someone had collapsed. We drove a little further over the bridge. There was another person in the road itself. The penny dropped that something quite serious was happening.
�쏷he traffic came to a standstill. The Uber driver said something bad is happening here. We could hear sirens coming.
�쏛 driver of a black cab said there has been a terrorist attack. They saw there were numerous people in the road. A second cab driver said there has been a series of stabbings.��
A 25-year-old man, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he was driving across the bridge when he saw a man and a pregnant woman unconscious on the road.
�쏻e thought it was a car accident but as we got closer we could see a lot of blood and bodies. There was a pregnant woman on the right who was severely injured and on the left there was a man being resuscitated, but he started breathing. We don�셳 know whether the woman survived,�� he said.
�쏻e had to get out of the car and there were lots of people screaming. And then ambulances arrived.��
It very quickly became clear that the attack was not over. After the attackers abandoned their vehicle outside the Barrow Boy & Banker pub, witnesses described attackers running into pubs and bars around London Bridge, and then Borough Market, stabbing people.
Another witness, Eric, told the BBC: �쏷hree men jumped out of the van and that�셲 when they started attacking people on the road. As they headed down the stairs, as they were running towards the people, they were shouting, �쁔his is for Allah��.
Gerard Vowls, 47, had been watching the Champions League final at the Ship pub in Borough. He was at the start of the south side of London Bridge and saw a woman being stabbed by three men 10 or 15 times.
�쏶he was going, �쁇elp me, help me�� and I couldn�셳 do nothing,�� he said. �쏧 want to know if this girl is still alive. I�셶e been walking around for an hour and a half crying my eyes out. I don�셳 know what to do.��
Vowls said he was throwing chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them.
�쏷hey kept coming to try to stab me �� they were stabbing everyone. Evil, evil people.��
It took at least 10 minutes for armed police to reach the scene, he added.
�쏷hey literally just started kicking them, punching them, they took out knives. It was a rampage really,�� another man told the BBC. The group of attackers headed towards Southwark Cathedral.
�쏛 woman was staring at them, and they started stabbing her,�� the witness said. �쏷hroughout the whole way across the bridge, there were people littered across bleeding. People were trying to help each other.��
One witness spoke of seeing one attacker stab his victim �쐁almly��. Ben was coming up to the entrance of the underground on Borough High Street when they saw people running.
�쏧 saw a man in red with quite a large blade, I don�셳 know the measurement �� I guess maybe 10 inches. He was stabbing a man �� he stabbed him about three times fairly calmly.
�쏧t looked [like] the man had maybe been trying to intervene but there wasn�셳 much that he could do, he was being stabbed quite coldly and he slumped to the ground.
The attacker and another man walked off quite �쐀oldly��.
�쏛 table was thrown, a bottle was thrown at the individual with the knife and then we heard three gunshots and we ran,�� he added.
Alex was in the Mudlark pub, close to Southwark Cathedral. �쏛 woman probably in her early 20s staggered into the pub and she was bleeding heavily from the neck and from her mouth. It appeared to myself and to my friends that her throat had been cut,�� he said. �쏱eople went to her aid. The pub was then closed. We saw police on the roads nearby. As we were told to leave the area by armed police, as we were running away from there, I could see to my left there was a further individual having CPR performed on them by the emergency services.��
Another witness in the Mudlark, 54-year-old Jeff Whitsey, told reporters the woman, aged in her 20s, staggered into the pub, aided by her friends. She was seriously injured.
�쏧t was a very deep cut. There was blood everywhere �� blood was spurting out. It was awful. Absolutely awful.��
Bethany Atkin, who works for the Guardian, was at Boro Bistro, a small restaurant which sits under a small bridge on Borough High Street.
�쏻e were sitting outside under umbrellas underneath the bridge and there was a shower of rubble that landed on the umbrellas, a van had crashed into the bridge.
�쏻e stood up, everyone was moving, I saw a man who was bleeding. I don�셳 know how he was injured. We ran into the restaurant and tried to find a safe place but there wasn�셳 one.��
Running back outside, Atkin saw another casualty. �쏻e saw a woman with blood, about 20 metres from the bridge. I saw her lying down on the floor.��
Atkin ran into London Bridge hospital to shelter but there was another commotion on the street. �쏛 man was shouting and then everyone started screaming and running away from the man. It was very sinister.��
At the El Pastor tapas restaurant, a man entered with a �쐄oot-long�� knife and started stabbing a woman, one witness told Sky News.
People inside were throwing bottles and chairs at the man to try to stop him. �쏷hey saw four others also armed with knives outside the restaurant in Borough Market.��
There were also reports of attackers at Roast restaurant.
A chef from Fish restaurant said: �쏧 saw two men with big knives downstairs outside Roast. They were stabbing people. The police were running away, they were normal officers, they were running away.
�쏷he guy with the knife was killing two people. We were shouting �쁲top, stop�� and people threw chairs at them.��
Video from the inside the Wright Brothers Oyster and Porter House restaurant on Stoney Street showed staff shouting at customers to evacuate and directing them to run away from the building down the street.
Jamie, who was in the Black & Blue restaurant further down Stoney Street, said he hid under the tables after hearing �쏿 massive, massive bang��.�쏱eople came into the restaurant and knocked a bunch of stuff over, like the till,�� he said. �쏛nd then we ran into the restaurant into the kitchen, where there was a bunch of other people and a guy had been stabbed and he was cut and he was bleeding quite a lot.��
Within eight minutes of the first call to emergency services, police officers arrived on the scene and shot dead three attackers outside the Wheatsheaf pub. The suspects were wearing what appeared to be explosive vests but these were later established to be fake.
Gabriele Sciotto, who took the photograph of the bodies, told the BBC: �쏧 ran towards the scene, noticed these men with explosive looking belts on their chests.
�쏷hey were running and police officers were trying to put themselves between the men and the crowd. Police ran towards them, more police came, and in a few seconds after a radio call, they shot three men down.
�쏷he canisters didn�셳 look real, they looked like toys, I wasn�셳 too scared.
�쏧 was simply in a bar watching the football, I was looking for the truth of this situation. You don�셳 realise how scary these situations can be. A policeman could have shot me I was very close.��
Owen Evans, 39, was in the Wheatsheaf pub nearby on Stoney Street with friends when he heard shots.
�쏧 was in the back of the pub. A wave of about 30 people ran in and tried to get into the cellar or cupboard. Then there were shots outside. They didn�셳 seem real �� like a kid letting off firecrackers. We saw police lights and everyone got down under a table. People turned tables over.
�쏻e waited about 10 minutes or so, with several shots every couple of minutes. Someone at the front of the pub had been shot �� it�셲 speculation but we thought it was by accident, there were bullet holes in the windows. The people near the person called for a medic, shouting: �쁇e�셲 fucking bleeding to death, we need a doctor.�� The bar staff were amazing, I think they locked the door so no one got in.
�쏷hen they told us to leave the pub and to run, and a policeman standing outside with a gun was shouting, �쁆o, get the fuck out.�� We ran down the street, turned left at the Market Porter, then ran down the road and away. We got to the South Bank and then waited ages for a tube, and eventually got home.��
Liam, who was in a flat above Southwark Tavern next to London Bridge, told BBC Radio 5 Live he heard screaming and saw people running down into the underground, running in any direction they could. �쏷he restaurant opposite had been completely smashed up, and a crowd of people were pointing into the market saying �쁥e�셲 down there��,�� he said.
�쏷hey got the attention of what looked like an armed police car, and pointed down Borough Market. The car screeched in that direction and we heard what sounded like five or six very loud gunshots.��
Videos show police going into bars soon after the attack telling people to remain on the floor. Police boats also searched the river �� apparently looking for people who may have been thrown off the bridge.
Following the shooting of the three attackers, police cordoned off the area and witnesses described hearing four controlled explosion carried out by police in the London Bridge area beginning at 1.23am.
As one grim atrocity follows another in unexpected locations across Europe �� Nice, Munich and this week, a church in a small town in Normandy �� everyone seems to have an opinion. Around family dinner tables, in bars and cafes, on social networks, everyone has a view about what is happening and who is to blame. For some, it�셲 Islam or refugees �� for others we should exonerate both at all costs. The problem is that it isn�셳 opinions we need now, but intelligence and understanding. Doctrinaire thinking �� and I have seen how political speech in France has become polarised since January 2015 �� only serves to divide public opinion, favour populism and eventually weaken society.
So let�셲 stick to the basics. Terrorism is political violence. More specifically, it is violence against a civilian population and its infrastructure committed by a non-state actor with a political objective. The question a traumatised public is entitled to ask, after such unpredictable attacks as those we have seen in Germany and France, is why.
Three main explanations, each with its own justifications and limitations then come into play: the political, the religious and the psychosocial. We know that someone�셲 decision to commit a violent act is often the result of at least two of these factors. Of course, nihilism or mental health problems lie behind many of the terrorist acts committed recently, but psychiatric conditions on their own are not enough to explain them.
Proponents of the political explanation will tell you that it is essential to address global imbalances in the fight against terrorism, which is primarily the result of authoritarian regimes confiscating both freedoms and economic resources. Of course we have to stop the bombers, they argue, but above all we have to stop the machines producing the bombers.
Islamic State thrives in areas populated by Sunni Arabs who are despised or repressed by their own governments in Damascus and Baghdad. Without good governance in the two capitals, there is little hope of successfully destroying it. In the Middle혻East, as in deprived areas of cities in Europe, a population on the economic or political margins is naturally prone to혻radicalisation.
Supporters of the theory of religious radicalisation, meanwhile, rely mainly on doctrine promulgated by Abu Musab as-Suri, who in 2004 published a 1,600-page document on the future of jihad. But it is a mistake to think of him as a guru for the jihadis of Isis, who mocked him in their magazine Dabiq for advocating an ecumenical jihad, not reserved for Salafists. The real inspiration for jihadis today is Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a thug who, having fallen out with Osama bin Laden, ended up creating Islamic State in Iraq. Don�셳 underestimate either the contribution of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP): sermons in English by the American-Yemeni preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, one of its key figures, and its English-language magazine Inspire were instrumental in spreading jihadi ideas in the west.
The trouble with this theory is that so many terrorists seem to be very bad Muslims. As many as one in six of the Europeans who have travelled to join Isis in the Middle East are converts to Islam. Even among those of Muslim origin, almost all renounce the Islam of혻their parents: they become the �쐀orn혻agains�� of Islam.
For Isis itself, religion is not the priority. �쏞ome and do your hijra, your migration to the land of Islam, and you will learn Islam later,�� we read in internet exchanges. It is not an urban legend that some of the jihadis from Europe arrested as they were about to enter Syria had the book Islam for Dummies in their luggage.
Today, the priority for Isis is not so much to convince supporters to join them in Syria as to push them to commit attacks wherever they are located. Among these terrorists, too, are some whose knowledge and practice of Islam are rudimentary. What matters for Isis, though, is that as many people as possible carry out attacks. Many jihadis are converts to violence more than converts to Islam. And despite popular belief, very few young people brought up in orthodox Islamdescend into violence.
The arguments for seeing murderous acts as evidence of mental illness are often queried by psychologists themselves, who are uncomfortable with psychological interpretations of social phenomena or delinquency. As for the military, they know very well that while dismissing one�셲 attacker as mentally ill can prove popular with public opinion, it has never weakened the enemy.
Manifestly, of course, many of the terrorists who have struck in Europe in recent months have had, at least, a fragile psychological background. But it is important to keep in mind a basic principle: it�셲 possible to be both a real terrorist and mentally ill.
As with any kind of sectarian indoctrination, religion can become a kind of healing or means of achieving redemption after a dissolute past, which corresponds perfectly with the apocalyptic vision of Isis. Many conversions to jihadism are preceded by a trail of violence and humiliation. Etymology gives us a good key to understanding radicalism. The word radical comes from the Latin word for root. Someone who is radicalised is someone who feels uprooted. Is an extremist, whether a jihadi or an ultra-nationalist, not someone who has an identity problem?
An act of violence is never simple and혻terrorism cannot be understood in혻a혻binary way. Understanding someone who attacks you is already a step towards controlling them. Knowing that beyond the casualties they can inflict,혻the terrorists�� ultimate aim is to혻scare us, allows us to be better prepared for the next time.
Saturday night�셲 dual terrorist incidents in London prompted the first use of a new police warning to the public, to �쐒un, hide, tell�� in the event of a weapons or firearms attack.
Shortly after 10pm on Saturday, attackers drove a white van into pedestrians on London Bridge, before continuing on to Borough Market and stabbing a number of people in the entertainment district.
Authorities have confirmed six people were killed and that police shot dead three suspects. Dozens of injured people have been taken to London hospitals.
As the incident was under way, the London Metropolitan police issued an alert through social media channels, warning people in the area to run away from any threat, rather than surrender or attempt to negotiate. If that wasn�셳 possible, they should instead hide, turn their phone to silent and barricade themselves in before calling police.
Many people out in London did not get the chance. Others, according to reports, instead took on the attackers head-on in an attempt to rescue victims, fighting back with chairs and pint glasses.
In an information video about the new campaign, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the instructions were based on proven advice.
�쏣veryone�셲 aware of the terrorism challenges across the world,�� he said. �쏧t can never cater for every possible eventuality and, if someone acts on instinct and perhaps decides to fight because they have no choice, we would never criticise them for that.��
When the police issued the advice on Saturday, reactions were varied. Some suggested it showed weakness. Others described it as practical advice designed to keep people safe. One rightwing Australian politician, Pauline Hanson, published a reworked version of the alert to campaign against Muslim immigration and was roundly criticised.
The new guidelines, developed by counter-terrorism police and released late last month, come amid a heightened security situation in Britain.
At any one time there are 500 active investigations by counter-terrorism agencies, involving 3,000 persons of interest.
Three fatal terrorism incidents have occurred in as many months �� four people were killed and more than 50 injured at Westminster on 22 March and 23 were killed and 116 injured in Manchester on 22 May.
Police have reportedly foiled five terrorist plots since Westminster, as well as another 13 since 2013.
Following the Manchester attack, intelligence services placed the country on its highest threat warning in almost 10 years, �쐁ritical��, which meant another international terrorism attack was expected to be imminent.
After the arrest of 11 suspects, the threat level was lowered back to �쐓evere�� just four days later, meaning another attack was �쐆ighly likely��.
The British prime minister, Theresa May, at the time said the country should remain vigilant.
Nearly all of the highest-profile domestic terrorism plots in the United States since 9/11 featured the "direct involvement" of government agents or informants, a new report says.
Some of the controversial "sting" operations "were proposed or led by informants", bordering on entrapment by law enforcement. Yet the courtroom obstacles to proving entrapment are significant, one of the reasons the stings persist.
The lengthy report, released on Monday by Human Rights Watch, raises questions about the US criminal justice system's ability to respect civil rights and due process in post-9/11 terrorism cases. It portrays a system that features not just the sting operations but secret evidence, anonymous juries, extensive pretrial detentions and convictions significantly removed from actual plots.
"In some cases the FBI may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by suggesting the idea of taking terrorist action or encouraging the target to act," the report alleges.
Out of the 494 cases related to terrorism the US has tried since 9/11, the plurality of convictions �� 18% overall �� are not for thwarted plots but for "material support" charges, a broad category expanded further by the 2001 Patriot Act that permits prosecutors to pursue charges with tenuous connections to a terrorist act or group.
In one such incident, the initial basis for a material-support case alleging a man provided "military gear" to al-Qaida turned out to be waterproof socks in his luggage.
Several cases featured years-long solitary confinement for accused terrorists before their trials. Some defendants displayed signs of mental incapacity. Jurors for the 2007 plot to attack the Fort Dix army base, itself influenced by government informants, were anonymous, limiting defense counsel's ability to screen out bias.
Human Rights Watch�셲 findings call into question the post-9/11 shift taken by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies toward stopping terrorist plots before they occur. While the vast majority of counterterrorism tactics involved are legally authorized, particularly after Congress and successive administrations relaxed restrictions on law enforcement and intelligence agencies for counterterrorism, they suggest that the government�셲 zeal to protect Americans has in some cases morphed into manufacturing threats.
The report focuses primarily on 27 cases and accordingly stops short of drawing systemic conclusions. It also finds several trials and convictions for "deliberate attempts at terrorism or terrorism financing" that it does not challenge.
The four high-profile domestic plots it found free of government involvement were the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing; Najibullah Zazi's 2009 plot to bomb the New York subway; the attempted Times Square carbombing of 2010; and the 2002 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport's El Al counter.
But the report is a rare attempt at a critical overview of a system often touted by the Obama administration and civil libertarian groups as a rigorous, capable and just alternative to the military tribunals and indefinite detention advocated by conservative critics. It comes as new pressure mounts on a variety of counterterrorism practices, from the courtroom use of warrantless surveillance to the no-fly list and law enforcement's "suspicious activity reports" database.
In particular, Human Rights Watch examines the extent and impact of law enforcement's use of terrorism informants, who can both steer people into attempted acts of violence and chill religious or civic behaviour in the communities they penetrate.
Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, a social services agency, told the Guardian she almost has a "radar for informants" sent to infiltrate her Brooklyn community.
While the FBI has long relied on confidential informants to alert them to criminal activity, for terrorism cases informants insert themselves into Muslim mosques, businesses and community gatherings and can cajole people toward a plot �쐗ho perhaps would never have participated in a terrorist act on their own initiative��, the study found.
Many trade information for cash. The FBI in 2008 estimated it had 15,000 paid informants. About 30% of post-9/11 terrorism cases are considered sting operations in which informants played an �쏿ctive role�� in incubating plots leading to arrest, according to studies cited in the Human Rights Watch report. Among those roles are making comments �쐔hat appeared designed to inflame the targets�� on �쐏olitically sensitive�� subjects, and pushing operations forward if a target�셲 �쐎pinions were deemed sufficiently troubling��.
Entrapment, the subject of much FBI criticism over the years, is difficult to prove in court. The burden is on a defendant to show he or she was not �쐏redisposed�� to commit a violent act, even if induced by a government agent. Human Rights Watch observes that standard focuses attention �쐍ot on the crime, but on the nature of the subject��, often against a backdrop where �쐇nflammatory stereotypes and highly charged characterizations of Islam and foreigners often prevail��.
Among the informants themselves there is less ambiguity. �쏧t is all about entrapment,�� Craig Monteilh, one such former FBI informant tasked with mosque infiltration, told the Guardian in 2012.
Informants, the study found, sometimes overcome their targets�� stated objections to engage in terrorism. A man convicted in 2006 of attempting to bomb the Herald Square subway station in Manhattan told an informant who concocted the plot he would have to check with his mother and was uncomfortable planting the bombs himself. One member of the "Newburgh Four" plot to attack synagogues and military planes �� whose case is the subject of an HBO documentary airing on Monday �� told his informant �쐌aybe my mission hasn�셳 come yet��.
Once in court, terrorism cases receive evidentiary and pre-trial leeway rarely afforded to non-terrorism cases. A federal judge in Virginia permitted into evidence statements made by a defendant while in a Saudi jail in which the defendant, Amed Omar Abu Ali, alleged torture, a longstanding practice in Saudi Arabia. The evidence formed the basis for a conviction, and eventually a life sentence, for conspiracy to assassinate George W Bush. Mohammed Warsame, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, was held in solitary confinement for five years before his trial.
Another implication of the law-enforcement tactics cited the report is a deepening alienation of American Muslims from a government that publicly insists it needs their support to head off extremism but secretly deploys informants to infiltrate mosques and community centers.
�쏷he best way to prevent violent extremism inspired by violent jihadists is to work with the Muslim American community �� which has consistently rejected terrorism �� to identify signs of radicalization and partner with law enforcement when an individual is drifting towards violence. And these partnerships can only work when we recognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American family,�� Obama said in a high-profile 2013 speech.
Yet the Obama administration has needed to purge Islamophobic training materials from FBI counterterrorism, which sparked deep suspicion in US Muslim communities. It is now conducting a review of similar material in the intelligence community after a document leaked by Edward Snowden used the slur �쏮ohammed Raghead�� as a placeholder for Muslims.
Four people have been arrested in and around the southern French city of Montpellier on suspicion of planning an imminent terrorist attack in France.
Police and judicial sources said those in custody included a 20-year-old man and his 16-year-old girlfriend, both known to authorites for connections with radical Islam, and said the attack had been due to take place in Paris.
Police found TATP explosives and other bomb-making materials in the man�셲 home, the sources said. The interior ministry confirmed that explosives had been found.
France, which will hold the first round of a presidential election in just over 10 weeks�� time, remains on high alert over possible Islamist militant attacks.
More than 230 people have died in a series of assaults since the beginning of 2015, and the country has been in a state of emergency since November that year.
�쏷he initial indications are that an imminent attack on French soil has been thwarted,�� the interior minister, Bruno Le Roux, said in the statement on Friday.
The government has said it foiled 17 attacks during 2016. In July, 86 people were killed when a man deliberately drove a truck into a crowd in the city of Nice.
On Friday, a makeshift memorial was being dismantled in Nice ahead of a carnival that was due to begin on Saturday.
Separately, a top French judicial body ruled as unconstitutional a law that aimed to catch would-be Islamist attackers. The law, which bans people from regularly consulting jihadi websites that encourage �쏿cts of terrorism��, was brought in last June.
Last Friday, a man was shot and seriously wounded when he attacked soldiers with machetes outside the Louvre museum in central Paris.
MI5 has launched two urgent inquiries into how it missed the danger posed by the Manchester bomber, Salman Abedi, amid claims his interest in being a potential terrorist killer was repeatedly reported to the authorities.
Britain�셲 domestic security service started one review last week, which will aim to quickly identify any glaring errors, while the other will be more in depth, the Guardian has learned.
On Sunday, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, refused to comment on whether opportunities were missed to spot the murderous intent of the 22-year-old before his deadly attack, as national security became the major issue in the general election campaign.
The reviews come with security officials warning that the threat from Islamist terrorism keeps rising and is at an �쐕nprecedented scale��, with other attack plots feared.
A 23-year-old man was arrested in the early hours of Monday in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, on �쐓uspicion of offences contrary to the terrorism act��, Greater Manchester police said, bringing to 14 the number in custody related to the Manchester attack inquiry.
The man was arrested at a flat above a clothes shop and a barbers, a short distance away from Shoreham�셲 railway station. A police car and officers are stationed outside the property.
Police are also this morning searching a detached property in Whalley Range, south Manchester.
The fallout from the attack has triggered an intense war of words across the political spectrum, with Rudd claiming that there would be a greater risk of another atrocity if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister.
As she accused the Labour leader of voting against anti-terror measures, saying there was �쐍o evidence he will keep people safe��, Rudd�셲 Labour counterpart, Diane Abbott, hit back by claiming that government cuts, including to the police and border force, have �쐁onsequences��.
�쏞itizens have a right to expect that the government sets their safety and protection as their number one priority and provides the resources to achieve that. It is no exaggeration to say that this government has failed in that elementary duty,�� the shadow home secretary told the Guardian.
Investigators believe Abedi, whose parents come from Libya, may have received terrorist training in the country, where some areas are believed to be a safe haven for jihadis. He returned to the UK from Libya just days before exploding a homemade bomb packed with metal bolts and screws, carried in a rucksack, murdering 22 people after the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on Monday 22 May.
Teachers and religious figures in Manchester who knew Abedi raised concerns about his extremist views on multiple occasions and over several years.
MI5 is believed to have conducted a quick review of the intelligence held about Abedi last week, but the inquiry was limited as the agency�셲 focus and resources were poured into the manhunt and recovering the materials linked to the bomb.
The second review will be more detailed and look at the decision-making around Abedi before his attack. A source said the key question, given what is now evident about the danger Abedi posed, would be: �쏻ould different decisions be made?��
The longer review will look at the processes and systems used to assess suspects and what was known about any of the other main conspirators. The system of assessing and managing risk used by MI5 is coming under immense strain, given the service�셲 unrelenting and rising workload.
Abedi had been examined by security service case officers in the past, but by last Monday was one of a pool of 20,000 one-time Islamist jihadi suspects. He was not one of the 3,000 people under active investigation.
MI5 says it has to prioritise which suspects it devotes its limited investigative resources to, to whom are deemed most dangerous. Rudd, speaking on the BBC1�셲 Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, said she did not want to �쐒ush to conclusions�� about intelligence failures.
But she added: �쏻e won�셳 shy away from looking at what we can do to keep people safe. We are in constant discussion with the security services and the police to make sure they have the right tools they need.��
Rudd warned that further members of Abedi�셲 network could still be at large. Speaking shortly before fresh raids were launched in Moss Side, Manchester, on Sunday afternoon, the home secretary warned: �쏻e can�셳 be entirely sure that [the Manchester operation] is closed.��
A 25-year-old man was arrested on Sunday in the Old Trafford area of Manchester on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act, bringing the total number of arrests linked to the attack to 14. A dozen of those remain in custody for questioning and two have been released without charge. Charges are expected against some.
In Brussels on Thursday, Theresa May confronted Donald Trump at a Nato meeting over the leak of detailed intelligence about the attack, which was shared across the Atlantic and published by the New York Times.
On Sunday, the president responded on social media, saying that May had been �쐖ery angry�� about the leak.
May also addressed the issue in the context of the general election on the second leg of her trip to the G7 summit in Sicily, claiming Corbyn had blamed the UK for the terror attack. Her intervention came after the Labour leader said the war on terror was not working, in a speech that angered his critics because it came just days after the Manchester attack.
Meanwhile, Max Hill QC, the government�셲 independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, wrote in the Telegraph that more resources, not new laws, were needed to deal with the terror threat.
Intelligence officials have come under fire after past atrocities. Both of the killers of fusilier Lee Rigby, who was murdered in London in 2013, had been subjects of interest for their extremist views before the attack but had not been under active surveillance. MI5 also faced claims they missed a chance to stop the ringleader of the 7 July 2005 bombing of London, Mohammad Sidique Khan.
Parliament�셲 intelligence and security committee may want to investigate the Manchester bombing, and inquests can be turned into broader inquiries if coroners agree. Privately, at least one cabinet minister has previously questioned MI5�셲 overall competence and the security service accepts it has hard questions to answer.
MI5 is getting more money and hiring more staff but the increase in its capacity �� it now employs about 4,000 staff �� will still take some time to be felt.
The level of terrorist activity directed at the UK is at an �쐕nprecedented scale��, sources say, and is believed by counter-terrorism officials to have kept growing since last year.
In October 2015, the MI5 director general, Andrew Parker, gave a rare speech warning: �쏻e have seen greater ambition for mass-casualty attacks. It may not yet have reached the high-water mark, and despite the successes we have had, we can never be confident of stopping everything.��
It emerged for the first time on Sunday that suspected Islamic terrorists are being prevented from returning to the UK after fighting abroad under new temporary exclusion orders.
Rudd admitted the authorities did not know how many Britons had returned from fighting with Islamic State or other extremist groups and refused to say how many times exclusion orders had been used. �쏻e have started to use them,�� she said.
The Liberal Democrats also waded into the debate over counter-terrorism policy, with Nick Clegg accusing May of creating a �쐂irect threat to our national security�� through her approach to Brexit.
The former deputy prime minister said the UK police and security services used an EU-wide database on organised criminal and terrorist suspects more than half a billion times last year �� equivalent to 16 times a second.
�쏷heresa May�셲 extreme approach to Brexit will have the direct consequence of severing our ties to a fantastically useful weapon in our armoury against terrorism,�� he said. �쏝y refusing to accept a role for the European court of justice in policing this European-wide database, she has ruled out our future participation it.��
A Conservative spokesman said: �쏻e�셶e made clear that under Theresa May security cooperation will be an important priority in the negotiations, in the interests of both sides.
�쏷his is a matter for the negotiations but what is absolutely certain is that a good Brexit deal can only be achieved under the leadership of Theresa May and her Conservative team. A vote for the Lib Dems just puts Jeremy Corbyn one step closer to Downing Street, undermining our national security and making a mess of the Brexit negotiations.��11 AUGUST 1988 Al-Qaeda is formed at a meeting attended by Bin Laden, Zawahiri and Dr Fadl in Peshawar, Pakistan.

Salman Abedi was British by birth, Libyan by background, a radical Islamist by identity, loyal to a �쐁aliphate�� based in Raqqa, Syria. These facts should be the starting point of our response to the atrocity he perpetrated: the threat is global, yet our state is national, and our communities local. Our state and our communities were not strong enough to stop him. The time to discuss why is not after the election, but now.
The �쐀lowback theory��, which blames Islamist terrorism directly on western expeditionary warfare, is both facile and irrelevant in this case. By bombing Libya we did not enrage or radicalise young Muslims such as Abedi: we simply gave them space to operate in. And then, whatever the intelligence services were doing, the politicians took their eye off the ball.
David Cameron was right to take military action to stop Gaddafi massacring his own people during the Libyan uprising of 2011: the action was sanctioned by the UN, proportionate, had no chance of escalating into an occupation. And Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy had a stabilisation plan. The problem is they had no plan for what to do if their plan went wrong. Nor, it appears, did Cameron�셲 ministers concern themselves about how a failed state in Libya might affect the growth of global jihadism, and the domestic terror threat in the UK.
In January 2016, in evidence to the foreign affairs committee, Liam Fox, defence secretary in 2011, was asked if the government had made an assessment of the threat of Islamic extremism among anti-Gaddafi rebels. Fox replied: �쏧 do not recall reading anything of that nature. That is not to say it would not have been혻done, but I don�셳 recall reading such material �� I do not recall reading any reports that set out the background of any Islamist activity to specific rebel groups.��
It is an astonishing failure. Because, as the committee report makes clear, from February 2011 Islamist rebels detached themselves from the main rebel militia, refused to take orders from it and killed its main commander. By October, the situation was out of control. Theresa May, as home secretary, sat through 55 national security council meetings on Libya between March and November 2011. The national security adviser�셲 �쐋essons learned�� report makes no mention of any Home Office contribution to that body�셲 decisions, nor any mention of the implications for domestic terror.
It is now reported that MI5 was facilitating the travel of non-jihadi British Libyans to fight in Tripoli. The minister responsible for that decision would have been May. Did she ask about the impact of the Libyan fighting on the terror threat here? That would be something the newspapers, if they did their job, would be shouting at her today, instead of hurling insults at Jeremy Corbyn.
In July 2011, as the fighting raged, May did warn that al-Qaida was seizing arms in Libya. However, she concluded, because of the Arab spring, �쏿l-Qaida is failing��. Unfortunately it was the Arab spring that failed, and the rise of Islamic State was one of the results.
In January this year May pulled the plug on any future strategy of regime change and foreign intervention, implicitly criticising Cameron�셲 Libya strategy. Speaking in Philadelphia, she decried �쐔he failed policies of the past��.
But it is the job of a government to do more than decry things. It has to deal with the mess created. And to do that, it has to ask a question May never bothered with: are cuts to the police and defence budgets sustainable in the context of the increased terror threat?
May�셲 response, to the rooms full of police federation reps who did raise it, year after year, was to reject the premise of the question. Now, with the terror threat at critical, she has had to deploy troops to guard key installations.
No matter by how much the budgets of GCHQ and MI5 have been boosted, in an attack such as this �� and the threat is ongoing �� it is the resilience of police, fire and A&E departments that is tested. The troop deployment is a tacit admission that this resilience is under strain.
Reversing police budget cuts now, as Labour has promised, should be mandatory. If anything, the recent spate of attacks �� both failed and successful �� shows the need for a more혻strategic혻rethink.
Britain needs the equivalent of the French GIGN, the full-time paramilitary force deployed to deal with the Bataclan attack. Such a force would need a new legal framework and heavy investment in extra resources �� not, as now, resources borrowed from frontline police and special forces.
But above all Britain needs to be in active collaboration with security services across Europe. Reports suggest the explosives used by Abedi, the bomb design and the networks utilised were those of radicalised north Africans living in European cities.
As they constructed their Brexit strategy, senior civil servants briefed journalists that May was prepared to threaten the EU with withdrawal of security and intelligence co-operation. May stupidly included the threat in her article 50 letter, later claiming it was not a threat at all. How hollow and foolish that all sounds now.
The Manchester massacre should be a wake-up call. This is a government of amateurs; Fox didn�셳 bother to ask about the terror implications when we bombed Libya; May lost 19,000 police in the face of reasoned warnings. Unfortunately the enemy we are fighting are professionals.
Jeremy Corbyn has, ignored by the commentators, repeatedly used prime minister�셲 questions to warn about the impact of police cuts on our security. He has �� at every point �� done what May and Fox did not: asked the right questions.
Laugh, if you want, at Diane Abbott�셲 failure to answer the question: how much would 10,000 extra police cost? But it was the wrong question. With the Isis caliphate about to collapse in Raqqa and Mosul, spreading its survivors into the refugee trails of Europe, I don�셳 care how much 10,000 new officers cost. The혻right question is: how soon can they혻start?
Graham Gooch�셲 specialist subject is West Indian pace bowling. He is probably the leading authority on what it was like to face the four horsemen of the apocalypse. From 1980 to 1995, when the West Indies dominated Test cricket, nobody scored more runs against them than Gooch, and only Allan Border faced more deliveries. Gooch also played the greatest innings of all time, 154 not out at Headingley in 1991. It is worth listening, then, when he says that only once in his career did he feel unsafe: Friday 21 February 1986 at Sabina Park, the first day of a much anticipated series, and the start of a weekend festival of chin music.
England had a bespoke batting line-up full of men who didn�셳 understand the concept of pain, yet they were still brutalised inside three days. It was horror bingo: they had to contend with a corrugated pitch, a low sightscreen, an umpire with a laissez-faire attitude towards bouncers and the volcanic pace of the debutant Patrick Patterson. �쏧t was the first time,�� said Gooch, �쏧�셝 ever really got the whiff of danger in the nostrils.��
That smell wafted around the ground, all the way to the press box. The Times�� John Woodcock wrote that he thought somebody might be killed. Wisden Cricket Monthly said it was �쐁ricket�셲 equivalent to the Somme��. The match was not televised because of a financial dispute between the BBC and the West Indies Cricket Board. You won�셳 find it on YouTube; you can�셳 buy it on a dodgy NTSC DVD from some bloke in Canada. It�셲 the last England Test match of which there is no footage. That�셲 both a shame, because we�셪l never see it, and a blessing, because we�셪l never see it. It could never be as vivid or as terrifying as it is in the imagination. The lack of footage makes it an almost mythical nightmare.
Five months earlier, it was the West Indies who were �쐑uaking in their boots��. That was David Gower�셲 flippant comment on the Oval balcony after his England side regained the Ashes with consecutive innings victories. The 3-1 defeat of Australia followed a fine 2-1 win in India, and for many jumping to conclusions became irresistible �� the trip to the Caribbean would decide which was the best team in the world. Even the experts thought England had an outside chance. At the start of the tour, the Guardian cricket correspondent Matthew Engel reflected the mood when he said ��2-1 to the West Indies might be a reasonable guestimate��.
It was only 18 months since the West Indies had won 5-0 in England, but the common perception was that they had aged and England had matured. The argument for England said they had the best batting line-up in the world (in 1985 they averaged a whopping 52 runs per wicket, miles clear of everyone else), and the best spin-bowling attack too. (Two Tests were to be played at Trinidad, which usually took spin.)
They had also picked three fast-bowling specialists: the batsmen David Smith and Peter Willey, two men who dark alleys were afraid to have walk down them, and the Glamorgan bowler Greg Thomas, often described as the fastest white bowler in the world. They had a solid seam attack and Ian Botham �� who had bowled faster than ever during the Ashes �� was overdue against the West Indies. By contrast, the Windies had an inexperienced captain in Viv Richards, and an ageing team with six regulars in their thirties. In 1985, they had even lost a Test match.
The main concern at the start of the tour was that England�셲 warm-up schedule �� three first-class matches and an ODI before the first Test �� would not be enough preparation. It turned out to be quite enough, thank you. In that time, morale, optimism and Mike Gatting�셲 nose all suffered enormous external and internal damage. A three-day pounding in the first Test at Sabina Park finished England off. It was the first time in history a team went 5-0 down after one Test.
England�셲 pre-series problems ranged from dreadful net facilities to politics, with four of the squad having been on the rebel tour of South Africa four years earlier. It was a particularly difficult time for Gower. His mother died just before the team flew out, a bereavement that was even tougher than usual for an only child whose father had died when he was younger, and whose long-term relationship was starting to break down. He and Botham, who had completed his first 1,000-mile charity walk at the end of 1985, were rested from the opening match and were on a yacht supping beers while England were being spun out for 94 by the Windward Islands, the only team in the Shell Shield with no West Indian cricketers. England lost by seven wickets and there were many pious editorials about Gower�셲 absence, some of them from people who regularly got pissed on the job, never mind off it.
Much of the media coverage had a freestyle approach to empathy and honesty. This was the height of the tabloid war, and as the tour went on Botham became so paranoid that he hardly left his hotel room in the evening. Allegations ranged from the England players leaving broken glass on a hotel tennis court to Botham and Lindy Field, a former Miss Barbados, and unproven accusations of breaking a bed during a night of sex and snort. When Gower sat down for a press conference before the one-day series, he was asked matter-of-factly whether his poor personal form was due to his affair with Paul Downton�셲 wife. Downton was England�셲 first-choice wicketkeeper, so it would have been some story were it true. The evidence of Gower�셲 affair was a picture of him kissing Mrs Downton on the cheek, at her wedding.
�쏷here was one bloke in particular �� a freelance hitman �� sending back the most remarkable crap,�� said Gower in his autobiography. The sports writers, alas, had to send back a couple of stories of the most remarkable crap too. After that embarrassing defeat to the Windward Islands, England got another touch of the nervous 94s in their next game. They played superbly for three and a half days against the Leeward Islands, then made a desperate mess of chasing 116 to win. They finished on 94 for eight with Sir Richie Richardson, the great West Indies No3 batsman, taking five for 40. He had never taken a first-class wicket in his life.
And so to Jamaica, where England faced three games in a fortnight. The first, a tour match, was won impressively by 158 runs, though Gower�셲 poor form continued after a comprehensive working-over from Courtney Walsh, during which he was hit on the hand, helmet and forearm. Walsh couldn�셳 even get in the West Indies squad for the first Test. Patterson, picked ahead of him, was omitted from the tour match so that England would not get a look at him.
They didn�셳 get much sight of him when he did play. The low sightscreen in front of the George Headley Stand made it difficult to see the ball properly when it was released by anybody over six foot. After problems in the tour match, England requested that it be raised for the upcoming ODI and Test. They were told this would not be possible, as it would impair the view of a few hundred spectators who had already bought tickets. �쏧t was a comforting thought, humming �쁇ail Marys�� to yourself as Patterson�셲 arm whirled over from a point comfortably off the radar, that someone had a good view,�� said Gower later.
Patterson was selected for the first ODI a few days later. He had been in deadly form during the Shell Shield season, splattering Guyana for 41 on the opening day of the season with figures of seven for 24. In the next game he and Walsh routed the Leeward Islands �� whose team included Richardson and Richards �� for 77. Patterson also left the Leewards�� opener Luther Kelly a little dentally challenged when a bouncer took out two front teeth. England struggled to reconcile the scare stories with the Patterson they knew. Most of them had played against him the previous summer when he was at Lancashire. He was sharp and raw, but so were tens of other West Indian fast bowlers waiting for a chance in international cricket.
Patterson had an upset stomach on his ODI debut, yet bowled with good pace to dismiss Tim Robinson and Gower for four-ball ducks. Marshall, the world�셲 best bowler, came on second-change; it felt like a sick joke to demonstrate the depth of the West Indies�� fast-bowling resources. Gatting, who had been England�셲 best batsman in the warm-up games, tried to hook a ball that skidded off the grassy pitch and squashed his nose. Like most of the England batsmen, he preferred a lighter, clearer helmet with no protective visor or bars.
Gatting�셲 hideous injury produced some famous photographs. �쏦e looked like a panda,�� says Smith, who would make his Test debut a few days later because of Gatting�셲 injury. �쏷here are times when you can�셳 think of anything to say. I remember walking into the physio�셲 room, where he was sitting on the bench, and I said, �쁀re you all right Gatt?�� It was pretty obvious, with two black eyes and a hole in his nose, that he wasn�셳 all right!��
When Marshall prepared to bowl the next delivery, he found a piece of Gatting�셲 nose in the ball and threw it down in disgust. After a few days of waiting for the swelling to subside, during which he suffered severe breathing difficulties, Gatting returned to England for surgery. (His replacement was the Middlesex opener Wilf Slack. England had gone to the Caribbean with no back-up opener, which was like going to Mars without a spare oxygen tank. There was even talk that Geoffrey Boycott, at the age of 45, would take Gatting�셲 place.) When Gatting arrived at Heathrow, he was asked by a journalist where exactly the ball had hit him.
�쏷he optimism of summer has evaporated,�� wrote Engel on the eve of the first Test, �쐔o be replaced by awe at the West Indians�� continuing fast bowling strength and apprehension about the way they will use it.�� England, decent outsiders when they flew out a month earlier, were now 16/1 to win the first Test.
England�셲 preparation was so thorough that even Botham, who was allergic to nets, had two long sessions with a futuristic new bowling machine called Fred. (�쏧t looked,�� wrote Engel, �쐋ike a cartoon Martian.��) The match was not televised, with the BBC loath to pay a reported 짙300,000 to cover the tour. They and ITN objected so strongly to being asked to pay 짙500 a day for highlights during their news bulletins that they issued a joint statement criticising the practice of charging for news feeds.
A deal was agreed for the remainder of the tour, with the BBC showing highlights on Sportsnight and Grandstand. This film gives a flavour of what England�셲 batsmen had to face, though none of it is from Sabina Park. The BBC chose to broadcast only the morning session of each day�셲 play on Radio 3, deciding that their primetime audience would prefer classical music to chin music. �쏱resumably,�� said one letter to the Guardian, �쐔he eager sporting listener can look forward to such future treats as the opening half hour of the World Cup final, lap one of the Olympic 1,500m final and the first five rounds of Barry McGuigan�셲 next title defence.��
England made a perfect start to the series. It lasted 55 minutes. Gooch and Robinson, who had made a spectacular start to his Test career, batted with calm authority against Marshall and Joel Garner. It was quiet, too damn quiet. Then Patterson replaced Marshall at the Dodgy Sightscreen End, and there was instant mayhem. Robinson was caught at slip, fending off a homing missile that cut sharply off the pitch towards his face, and Gower was given the hurry up by Patterson to such an extent that he slashed his second and third deliveries for four and six over third man. He soon went to Michael Holding for an eccentric 10-ball 16.
The England dressing-room fast realised that this was not the Patterson they knew from Lancashire. �쏦e was a shock,�� said Botham in his autobiography, Don�셳 Tell Kath. �쏦e was murderously quick and so raw, so full of hatred, like Colin Croft and Sylvester Clarke used to be. I expect he�셲 a lovely bloke off the field.�� Gower confirmed as much. �쏦e was, as with so many of those West Indian quicks, a very nice guy,�� he wrote in An Endangered Species. �쏦e called me �쁃��.��
Patterson�셲 ungainly style made him even more intimidating. He was all muscle and bustle, with none of Holding�셲 elegance and little of Marshall�셲 craft. He could, however, bowl faster than the lot of them. �쏦e had a powerful action rather than an easy, lithe one,�� says Thomas. �쏦e was a bit wild but, bloody hell, he did bowl quickly.�� As a batsman and umpire, Willey has seen all the great fast bowlers of the last 40 years. None left an impression quite like Patterson. �쏧f people are bowling 90 miles an hour now,�� he says, �쏱atterson must have been bowling 100mph in that game.�� Anyone familiar with Willey will know this is certainly not inmydayism.
Patterson was gap-toothed and bow-legged, with a cruiserweight�셲 frame and a few distinctive features: enormous thighs on top of matchstick legs, and shot-putter�셲 shoulders that gave him devastating power and speed. �쏱atrick,�� wrote the author Frances Edmonds, wife of the England spinner Phil, �쐆as muscles in places where other man simply do not have places.��
His bowling action was a statement of the most malevolent intent. He thrust his left foot towards the batsman, spikes showing, his leg so high as to provide a rigorous test of the fabric in his trousers. Then the foot would slam down �� �쐆ard enough to measure on the Richter scale�� in Mike Selvey�셲 words �� and his body would propel forward to batter the ball into the pitch. Cricinfo�셲 Andrew Miller memorably described it as �쏿 stiff-limbed, stud-slamming action like a windmill being ripped off its axis in a hurricane��.
Patterson got the ball to lift viciously off a hard, ridged pitch that started uneven and got worse. It looked like an ironic haircut: bald for the most part, with rogue tufts here and there and a big green patch in the middle - also known, in this match, as a good length. �쏧t�셲 one of the worst wickets I�셶e played on against bowlers of that calibre,�� says Willey, whose rumbustious second-innings 71 was the highest score of the match. �쏧t was German 88 millimetres against air pistols. We were just blasted out of it. We didn�셳 mind the bouncers; that�셲 the way cricket was. They could bowl you four or five bouncers an over and it wasn�셳 a bother, you learned how to play them. The trouble was the uneven bounce. If somebody�셲 bowls two balls in the same spot at that pace, and one goes past your neck and one goes past your ankles, you�셱e knackered.��
It made for arguably the scariest match England have ever played. The Bodyline series of 1932-33 was played on truer pitches, and although the abandoned Test of 1997-98 was played on another diabolical surface at Sabina Park, at least it didn�셳 go the distance. And Richardson, who was at both games, reckoned the 1986 pitch was worse. There was no chance of it being abandoned. �쏯o, that was never discussed,�� says Thomas. �쏽ou just played and that was it. It was the kind of thing you accepted, even if you were a tailender. It was a tough job.�� These were different times for masculinity, when most batsmen would rather lose their features than lose face.
In 1986 there was no limit on the number of bouncers that could be bowled. It was left to the umpires to judge whether, in accordance with Law 42, the bowling was deliberately intimidatory. The batsmen got some protection from one umpire, David Archer. But Johnny Gayle, who was at Patterson�셲 end, saw nothing wrong.
England adopted a sod-this-for-a-lark approach to batting. Even though they were skittled twice, they scored their runs at 3.52 runs per over, their fastest against West Indies since 1939. The old bad-wicket mantra �� get as many as you can before the pitch gets you �� had a darker implication. �쏤or the first and, I think, only time, I began saying to myself: Graham, it might be doing yourself a favour if you got out,�� wrote Gooch in his autobiography. �쏷his boy Patterson is really firing and it could get very nasty indeed. If you don�셳 watch it, you could be hit very badly.��
Allan Lamb�셲 mortality-awareness levels were also going through the roof. When he started to counter-attack successfully, Richards told Marshall to give him a �쐓erious delivery��. Lamb enquired what that meant. Richards smiled. �쏧t�셲 one that you eat, Lamby.�� It wasn�셳 even lunchtime on the first day. Lamb spanked 49 from 67 balls before being bowled by an unplayable grubber from Garner. �쏧�셶e usually managed to find a bit of fun in cricket, whatever the state of the game, but not that morning in Kingston,�� he said in his autobiography. �쏧�셫 not saying I was keen to get out �� but I fancied a change of scenery because it struck me that life can, on occasions, be more important than a cricket match.��
England were bowled out for 159 in 45.3 overs, with Patterson taking four for 30. Gooch top-scored with 51 before being caught off the splice from an unplayable Marshall lifter. It�셲 impossible to overstate how good Marshall was, and in 1986 he was in the middle of a five-year spell when he took 235 Test wickets at an average of 18.47.
Thomas, batting at No11 even though he had a first-class century, was needed by mid-afternoon. �쏡uring the innings I was talking to Bob Willis, who was the tour manager,�� he says. �쏧�셝 been on a British Colleges trip to West Indies a couple of years earlier and, as there wasn�셳 that much media attention on the game, I said to him, �쁔o be honest Bob, this doesn�셳 feel like a bloody Test match. It feels like being on tour with the lads.��
�쏷he game went on and I went into bat. There was only one man in front of the wicket, at short square-leg. I looked round, and Jeff Dujon and the slips were miles back. Then Garner ran into bowl. I don�셳 remember seeing the ball, I heard a clatter �� this was my first ball �� and the leg stump almost reached Dujon. I walked back to the changing room and was taking my pads off when Bob tapped me on the shoulder. He said, �쁃oes it feel like a Test match now?!�쇺��
The longer the tour went on, the more England would need gallows humour.
Marshall, Holding and Garner were three all-time greats, yet it was Patterson who stood out. �쏧f anyone has ever bowled quicker than that, well ...�� said Gooch. �쏦e was rapid, and I mean really rapid.�� That view is supported by Dujon, the wicketkeeper who was chief witness to the West Indies�� reign of terror. He kept to all the greats from 1981 to 1991, and did so with such feline excellence that 95mph deliveries became much of a muchness. Every time he is interviewed, he patiently answers the inevitable question. Who was the fastest? Dujon cites two spells, both by Patterson: Sabina Park 1986 and the last day of the Boxing Day Test in 1988, when Australa unwisely provoked him and he threatened to kill them all the next day. He settled for the compromise of a matchwinning five-for. In the first over of that spell, Dujon took a short delivery and heard a scrunch. A split-second later, the pain of a broken finger reached his brain.
The strange thing about Sabina Park is that the only person who retired hurt was a West Indian batsman. Late on the first day, Gordon Greenidge hooked Botham into his own face and needed three stitches. West Indies finished the day on 85 for nought, though that particular score flattered them. Thomas could have dismissed Desmond Haynes with his first two balls in Test cricket. The first flew off the edge between first and second slip; the second was put down by Willey in the gully. He completed a spectacular over by ripping one straight past Haynes�셲 face.
In Thomas�셲 next over, Greenidge gave him what Garner called �쏿 father�셲 correction��, bashing three fours. Thomas�셲 performance in the match led Christopher Martin-Jenkins to write in the Cricketer that �쐆e is the real thing at last��, and though his series figures of eight wickets at 46 were modest, the sheer heat and quality of his bowling had most predicting that England�셲 hunt for a truly fast bowler was over �� including the greatest of them all. �쏧 could see that here was an outstanding young talent,�� said Marshall in his autobiography, Marshall Arts. �쏦e earned the respect of all our batsmen.�� This being the 1980s, he played only one more Test in his career. Thomas only realised he had earned the opposition�셲 respect when, as the series progressed, they started to administer a few more �쐄ather�셲 corrections��. Being targeted by the West Indies batsmen was a strange kind of compliment.
Thomas and particularly Botham hit the green bit of the pitch with similar frequency to the West Indies bowlers. �쏷here were overs in which Botham bowled six attempted bouncers,�� wrote Woodcock in the Times. �쏛ll that did was stir up further trouble for England�셲 batsmen, especially with umpires who pay not the slightest attention to the law as it relates to short-pitched bowling.��
One man�셲 bouncer is another man�셲 shortish delivery. �쏧 don�셳 remember anyone bowling many bouncers,�� says Thomas. �쏧t was more back-of-a-length stuff on both sides. You didn�셳 need to bowl bouncers on that wicket, it was flying.�� One short ball from Botham was hooked for six by the debutant Carlisle Best, his first scoring stroke in Test cricket. Best famously commentated on his own innings �� �쏽ou can�셳 bowl there to Carlisle Best�� �� and doubtless had plenty to say as he launched Beefy into the crowd. Amid the virility, Richard Ellison�셲 crafty swing bowling yielded a third five-for in as many Tests. This being the 1980s, he played only three more Tests in his career. Ellison concentrated on a different part of the body; four of his wickets were LBW, part of a then-record-equalling six in the innings. West Indies were dismissed for 307, a lead of 148.
There was also a row between Greenidge and Edmonds, who was standing intrusively close at short leg. It was an unusual occurrence in the series, despite the punishing nature of the cricket. Most were already friends from county cricket. �쏻e all got on exceptionally well; it was excellent that way,�� says Thomas. �쏷here was no animosity, nothing whatsoever.�� Both teams knew that it was nothing personal, just business. And that West Indies had an unchallengeable monopoly.
On the third morning, before play, Robinson practised with the bowling machine, Fred, on a concrete wicket. Fred could do almost anything. He could give you a 94mph bouncer or a 66mph inswinger. What he couldn�셳 replicate was a length delivery from the 6ft 8ins Garner that would shoot along the floor. Robinson was bowled for a duck, and Gooch followed for nought in the next over from Marshall. Robinson went to the West Indies averaging 62 per innings, thinking Test cricket was a �쐏iece of piss��. He barely made that many in the series: 72 runs, an average of nine, and his Test career never truly recovered.
Soon it was time for Patterson�셲 second crack at England, a six-over spell of unprecedented menace. There are no greater compliments from no greater authorities than those he received for his speed in the second innings. In the Times, Woodcock deemed it on a par with Frank Tyson in the 1954-55, �쐎ne or two of his short ones being just about as fast as man can bowl��, while Wisden said his pace was �쐁omparable to that of Jeff Thomson of Australia in his prime��.
One delivery cleared everyone and bounced just inside the boundary. Gower was caught at third man, placed there deliberately as a catcher two balls earlier. It was his seventh failure out of seven on the tour: his scores were 5, 9, 2, 11, 0, 16, 9. Lamb then received what Engel described as �쐔he most extraordinary cannonade of bouncers��. His innings had more incident that most seven-hour centuries. He was at the crease for 15 balls. Lamb was hit on the helmet and the body, slapped three boundaries and was caught top-edging a hook.
He was one of three men out hooking in the innings. Botham, who had fallen that way in the first innings, landed a few haymakers in a 28-ball 29 that included two hooked sixes: one top-edged off Patterson, one off the meat from the first ball of Marshall�셲 spell. Marshall went straight around the wicket and bowled four more consecutive bouncers, two of which Botham walloped for four to make it 14 from the over. Marshall was stirred first by the unspoken speed contest with Patterson and then by Botham�셲 chutzpah. In Marshall�셲 next over Botham was bowled�� while hooking, another victim of the uneven bounce. It was the start of another difficult tour, particularly with the bat; he averaged 16.8 with a top score of 38.
The West Indies were the one team Botham could never conquer. Willey was almost the opposite, a West Indies specialist who played 15 of his 26 Tests against them, facing the bowlers head on with his extraordinary open stance. When he went out to bat in the second innings in Jamaica, having been pushed up from No7 to No4, Willey was not exactly high on life. �쏧 had a bit of a humour on,�� he says. �쏧t was horrible. One ball was going past your throat, one was going past your ankles. So I decided to have a swing at anything that was in the slot.�� He crashed 71 from 104 balls, including nine fours and a six off Patterson. When he reached his half-century, the press box tossed impartiality out the window and stood to applaud.
Willey does not recall the low sightscreen or Patterson�셲 studs-up action. �쏧 didn�셳 see the foot and I didn�셳 care what was going on behind him,�� he says. �쏽ou�셱e just looking for that thing coming down at you.�� He was in a higher state of concentration. �쏶ometimes, it�셲 not you batting. You�셱e in the zone. You don�셳 think about what you�셱e going to do; it just happens. There�셲 no time to think.
�쏽ou never thought about getting hit. It never entered your head, not even on a day like that. I put the grill on in the first innings and I got out for nought; I couldn�셳 see the ball. The second innings I put the side flaps on and just watched the ball. It�셲 like a boxer; you watch the fist. If you watch the ball, 99.9% of the time you�셪l find a way to get your head out of the way. Doesn�셳 matter if it hits you anywhere else.��
When he was dismissed, Willey walked back to the dressing-room and was greeted by Thomas.
Thomas remembers it well. �쏦e looked like death. Honestly, he was gaunt and pale. And he�셲 a bloody tough character.��
The same was true of Smith. He was picked because of his ability against fast bowling, but his debut was not a good one. He made one in the first innings and nought in the second, when he batted at No7 because of sunstroke and was caught on the boundary hooking Marshall. �쏧 don�셳 think I�셶e ever seen anybody so angry in the changing-rooms,�� laughs Thomas. �쏦e was absolutely fuming because Marshall bounced him out, and he threw his helmet on the floor. I never thought a helmet could break into so many pieces! Nobody went anywhere near him for quite some time. Honestly, he was in a foul mood! It was quite frightening.��
When he was recalled for the fourth Test in Trinidad, Smith top-scored in both innings with 47 and 32. This being the 80s ... well, you know the rest. He missed the last match through injury and didn�셳 play another Test. �쏧t gives me a lot of pride to have top-scored in both innings,�� he says. �쏷alking about it makes me go cold because it�셲 the most exciting thing you can ever do on a cricket field. The thrill was in the challenge, knowing that it was the pinnacle �� that you couldn�셳 go any higher.�� Not just in 1986, but ever. Test batting will certainly never be as tough again.
�쏧 was never scared; that never came into it. You know you�셪l get hit, but you wipe that out of your head. To me it was a battle. It was like walking around in certain parts of London. I won�셳 start anything, but if somebody wants to have a row �╈��
Smith had been picked at the age of 30 after a barnstorming performance against an otherwise rampant Marshall in the County Championship the previous summer. In Trinidad he took on the West Indies to such an extent that his partner Lamb kept trying to shut him up for fear of reprisals. �쏱atterson hit me and he was standing next to me,�� says Smith. �쏧 told him to eff off. Leave me alone! They�셱e trying to kill you anyway, so whatever. You can�셳 wind them up anymore! I�셫 not a thug but I would take people on. Viv was having a few words with me so I pointed my bat at him and said, �쁈f you want it as well, you can have it!�� I wouldn�셳 back down. It was just part of the battle. I had a huge amount of respect for the West Indian players. It was awesome to play against them.��
With the match approaching its conclusion, Edmonds was hit over the heart by an accidental beamer from Patterson. �쏧 felt,�� he said, �쏿s if my chest had caved in.�� And that was with the kind of chest protector used by jockeys to protect them from a horse�셲 kick. As he staggered around like a confused zombie, Edmonds dislodged the bails, and should technically have been given out. Both umpires left the decision to the other, and he was given another life.
In Another Bloody Tour, her famous book of the tour, Edmonds�� wife Frances wrote: �쏷here is a protective bodice, a lot of very thick skin, quite a bit of excess adipose tissue and a wodge of cheque books to penetrate before anyone gets anywhere near Phil Edmonds�� heart.��
The next ball was short, straight into the hip. �쏷he longer the match went on, the less like a civilised game of cricket it became,�� wrote Woodcock. �쏣xcept on that evening of ill fame at Old Trafford in 1976, when Close and John Edrich were subjected to such a disgraceful barrage by the West Indian fast bowlers, I think I have never felt it more likely that we should see someone killed.��
Edmonds was soon the last man to fall, to give Patterson his seventh wicket of the match. �쏧 wouldn�셳 say it was shit batting, we just got bowled out,�� says Willey. �쏻hen you talk to some modern cricketers about the West Indies they say, �쁀h, they weren�셳 that quick.�� I�셝 like to see them face Patterson on those wickets.��
West Indies needed five runs to complete a 10-wicket victory. England lasted 88.2 overs in the match �� not eye-catching these days, but almost without precedent in 1986. It was 79 years since they had been bowled out so quickly in both innings of a Test. �쏱erhaps no team in history would have coped any better,�� wrote Engel. �쏧 can�셳 recall a Test when it was so impossible to foresee any result other than a win for one side.��
There are photos of Edmonds on a beach a few days later, with a grotesque crater just below his left nipple. The mental bruising took even longer to subside. In most mismatches there is a quick finish, a knockout blow or a couple of hours of misery. England had to stand there and take it for the best part of three months. They were getting it from their own, too, with increasingly vituperative criticism of everything from the decision to make some net sessions optional to the inability to repel the greatest bowling attack in history. �쏧t has been very easy to abuse England on this trip,�� wrote Engel. �쏰ne or two people in the press box have sounded a bit like Lord Haig, demanding from the comfort of HQ that soldiers hurl themselves against the enemy guns.��
After Jamaica, England looked like a team with a touch of PTSD. �쏷he team talks got shorter and shorter,�� laughs Thomas. �쏷here was nothing much to talk about.�� A 5-0 defeat was inevitable, and confirmed at Antigua after Richards blasted an astonishing 56-ball century. �쏛fter the first Test, the bouncers were never overdone,�� said Engel. �쏷here was no need �� the batsmen had seen enough.�� It was still the toughest assignment in cricket history, especially as at least three of the pitches were dodgy, and England exceeded 200 only twice in 10 innings. There was only one hundred on the entire tour, Gooch�셲 epic to win the second ODI. In the fourth Test at spin-friendly Trinidad, the West Indies included the off-spinner Roger Harper. He didn�셳 bowl a single ball.
This was the end of the West Indies�� most dominant period, one last series when they postponed the slow, decade-long transition that began when the core of their greatest team started to go over the hill. They drew their next four series, three of them away from home, and although they stuffed England 4-0 in 1988, they had gone from the greatest to merely great. The 1985-86 series was the conclusion of a four-year spell in which they won seven series in a row and had a record of 23 wins and one defeat. And the defeat was in a dead rubber.
On the first morning of the second Test in Trinidad, Patterson�셲 first six overs went for 54 as Gower and Lamb launched a breathless counterattack. (Scorecard aficionados will love England�셲 first innings.) There were 10 no-balls in that, a recurring problem in his career and an indication of how he could struggle if his rhythm was not right. He did not have a classical action to fall back on. The locals said he was never the same away from Sabina Park, too, and eventually he ended his career with 93 wickets at 30.90 from 28 Tests. He did produce some more chilling spells, particularly overseas. There was that day in Melbourne, and in 1987-88 he took five-fors in consecutive Tests in India. The dashing opener Kris Srikkanth recalled one evening in Kolkata. �쏧 knew if I got hit by any of his deliveries, I could die on the spot,�� he said in 2009. �쏦e walked down the pitch and gave me cold stares and I felt the chill running down the spine. I survived only because of my reflexes.��
Patterson�셲 international career ended at the age of 31 when he was sent home from a tour of Australia for disciplinary reasons. He became a paranoid recluse, prompting wild speculation about what had happened to him. Some said he was a destitute drug addict; others that he was in an asylum. He was found last month by the Indian journalist Bharat Sundaresan, the culmination of a six-year search. The result was one of the more poignant features of the year.
In England, there was a significant moral panic over the nature of the West Indies�� domination. �쏷he West Indies and the other members of the ICC ought to be asking themselves if this is really what they want cricket to be,�� wrote Engel. Suggestions ranged from a longer pitch, a no-ball line halfway down the pitch and a ball made of rubber. The Wisden Cricket Monthly editor David Frith, lamenting �쏿 curse both on the spirit of the game and as a spectacle��, suggested an amendment to Law 42, which eventually happened in 1991. For richer and poorer, cricket was never the same again.
The only people not complaining about the West Indies�� tactics were the England players. They were aggrieved about uneven bounce, not bouncers. �쏽ou can easily become a bit shell-shocked, and there were some quiet times in the dressing-room, but I don�셳 remember anybody complaining,�� says Smith. �쏻ould I want to play with any other people? No, not at all. There were some tough cookies in that team, and I was proud to be a part of it.��
England�셲 top scorer in the series, by some distance, was Gower, who recovered from his desperate start to hit scores of 66, 47, 66, 23, 10, 22, 90 and 21 in the last four Tests. There is more than one way to show character. In context, Gower�셲 370 runs were as worthy as his 715 against Australia the previous summer. �쏝ecause he was such a languidly classical batsman, it is often ignored that David was full of guts and immense courage when the fast bowling was at its most dangerous,�� said Gooch. �쏧t was an understated courage, and would laugh it off later in the evening with a typical quip; but I knew, from the other end, how many times I was witness to his fearlessness and genuine bottle.��
You can�셳 dress up a 5-0 battering but you can look at it with fresh eyes. In a world that has become almost too health-and-safety conscious to function, the level of courage and skill frequently shown by the England batsmen 31 years ago is almost beyond comprehension. It remains a grisly old tale, but at least they all lived to tell it.
Greg Thomas now runs Legato Legal Services. David Smith is the manager of Lashings All Stars, whose next match is at Roe Green Cricket Club in Manchester on 17 August
Donald Trump has spent the bulk of his new presidency playing tough in the face of terrorism. Yet pretty much everything he�셲 proposed, beyond being bigoted in the extreme, shows just how terrified and weak he is �� all while putting the country at greater risk.
This week, Trump spent much of his time claiming �� falsely �� that the media downplays terrorist attacks for �쐒easons�� he did not explain. �쏧t�셲 gotten to a point where it�셲 not even being reported,�� he proclaimed at a military event on Tuesday. �쏛nd in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn�셳 want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.�� The White House followed up with a list of 73 terror attacks over the past few years which they claimed were �쐕nder-covered��.
The idea that the media downplays terror attacks is hard to fathom. For 15 years, terror attacks �� and countless terror threats that never materialized �� have led to wall-to-wall coverage on television, in print and online. Many times such coverage has led to politicians to implement disturbing policies that would have done nothing to prevent the attacks in the first place and only further restrict the rights of millions of innocent people.
The numbers back up just how undeniably wrong Trump�셲 claims are: Peter Bergen at CNN calculated that the 78 terrorist attacks the White House claimed were �쐕nder-reported�� were the subject of 80,000 articles. 80,000!
But what makes Trump�셲 uneducated musing even more infuriating is that at the same time as he instills fear into the American people about Islamist terrorism �� which only does the terrorists�� job for them �� he�셲 going out of his way to create a blind spot inside the US government for an arguably greater threat: terrorism committed by white nationalist, far-right groups.
According to Reuters, Trump wants to change the name of the Department of Homeland Security�셲 �쏞ountering Violent Extremism�� program to �쏞ountering Radical Islamic Extremism��. Under this plan, violent white supremacists would no longer be targeted. Meanwhile, his �쐋ist�� of 78 terror attacks that the White House released this week contained exactly zero white supremacist incidents.
Amidst this latest Trump controversy, CNN�셲 Jake Tapper asked pointed questions of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway about why, after all the complaining Trump has done of the media�셲 coverage of terror attacks, he didn�셳 tweet anything about the most recent terror attack in Canada. The answer, as Tapper indicated, is the attack was carried out by a white supremacist against Muslims, which made for a very awkward response from Conway that ended with: �쐎f course put us on the record as always being sad about this as a senseless loss of life��. Not exactly the tough talk Trump�셲 team reserves for Islamic terrorism, but I guess that�셲 to be expected when white nationalists make up some of Trump�셲 fan base.
The facts speak for themselves. Americans have been more likely to have been killed by a white supremacist terrorist than Islamic terrorism since 9/11. Refugees from any country have literally never carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the US.
Career national security officials and civil liberties advocates vehemently disagree on almost everything, but it seems there�셲 one that unites them: alienating millions of people based on their national origin or religion is an awful way to go about stopping terrorist groups. That�셲 especially true when some of these groups feed off the perception that the west is at war against Islam. And there�셲 been plenty of reports about Isis using Trump�셲 policies as a recruiting tool to gain more converts.
None of these facts matter to Trump, of course. He apparently wants upend society, tear families apart and amplify the terrorists�� message for them. Worse, he�셲 doing all this while trying to blame judges and the American people for coming attacks. It�셲 beyond cynical; it�셲 deplorable, and he�셲 only going to get worse.
That�셲 the most terrifying aspect of all this: we haven�셳 seen a terrorist attack in the US since Trump has been elected. Some of the country�셲 most despicable and bigoted policies have been implemented in the immediate aftermath of attack. There�셲 no telling what Trump will do when the next one comes around.A Tunisian man has been charged with terror offences after being arrested for driving at high speed into a crowded shopping area in the Belgian port city of Antwerp, though his motives remain unclear.
The 39-year-old suspect, identified only as Mohamed R, was charged with �쏿n attempt to murder in a terrorist manner, an attempt to hit and wound in a terrorist manner, and arms infractions��, the federal prosecutor�셲 office said.
However, a source close to the investigation said investigators could not confirm whether it was a terrorist attack and said the driver made little sense during interrogation.
Other sources said the charges could be interpreted as a �쐏recautionary measure�� in order to keep the suspect in detention.
The incident came a day after an attack on the British parliament killed five people including the attacker. Wednesday was also the first anniversary of the Brussels suicide bombings in which 32 people died.
Mohamed R drove at high speed through the busy Meir shopping area in Antwerp, forcing people to jump out of the way, authorities said. No injuries were reported. He also ignored an initial order to stop by soldiers.
The authorities said they found a rifle and bladed weapons in the car after they arrested the suspect in a parking lot on Thursday.
The Antwerp incident put Europe further on edge after the London attack and the incident at Paris�셲 Orly airport last Saturday when a man was shot dead after grabbing a soldier�셲 rifle.
Investigators said the man in Antwerp was clearly �쐕nder the influence of something�� but it was not clear what substance. He was not in a state to be questioned by police until Friday, a source close to the investigation said. Even then, his explanation �쐌ade no sense�� and it was not confirmed that it amounted to a terrorist attack, the source added.
The source said the suspect had recently travelled between Belgium and the Netherlands, living in his car. A French source close to the investigation said the man had spent the night in a holding cell in Antwerp on the eve of the incident before being released on Thursday morning.
The suspect had a history of petty crime, such as public drunkenness and drug use, but has apparently never been flagged as a radical, a French police source said. Interrogated by French police, a friend of the suspect said the weapon in the boot of the car had been there for a long time and did not work.
The Belgian federal prosecutor�셲 office said the suspect was driving at �쐖ery high speed�� and that �쏿t different times pedestrians were placed in danger��.
The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, praised security services in the Flemish-speaking city, who �쐂id an excellent job��.
Belgium has been on high alert since 22 March last year when suicide bombers attacked Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro station, killing 32 people and leaving more than 320 wounded.
Belgium suffered a further shock in August when a machete-wielding man shouting �쏛llahu Akbar�� (God is greatest) attacked two police officers in the industrial town of Charleroi, before being shot dead.
So there was no ticking time bomb. No urgent need ever arose to torture anybody who was withholding crucial details, so that civilisation as we know it could be saved in the nick of time. No wires had to be tapped, special prisons erected or international accords violated. No innocent people had to be grabbed off the street in their home country, transported across the globe and waterboarded. Drones, daisy-cutters, invasions, occupations were, it has transpired, not necessary.
Indeed, when it actually came down to it, to forestall a near-calamitous terrorist atrocity in the US the authorities didn't even have to go in search of information or informants. The alleged terrorist's father came to the US embassy in Nigeria of his own free will and warned them that his son, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had disappeared and could be in the company of Yemeni terrorists.
Meanwhile the National Security Agency had heard that al-Qaida in Yemen was planning to use an unnamed Nigerian in an attack on the US. If that were not enough, then came Abdulmutallab himself, a 23-year-old Nigerian bound for Detroit who bought his ticket in cash, checked in no bags and left no contact information. For seven years the American state manipulated the public with its multicoloured terror alerts. But when all the warning lights were flashing red, it did nothing.
To brand this near miss a "systemic failure", as Barack Obama has done, is혻both true and inadequate. It reduces the moral vacuity, political malevolence혻and enduring strategic recklessness that has been the enduring response to the 9/11 attacks to a question of managerial competence.
"Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack," explains Arjun Appadurai in Fear of Small Numbers. During the Bush years that terror was routinely leveraged for the purposes of social control, military mobilisation and electoral advantage. Meanwhile, the administrative processes that might prevent the next attack were tragically lacking. In short, Bush's anti-terror strategy was not about protecting people but about scaring them.
To galvanise the nation for war abroad and sedate it for repression at home, the previous administration constructed a terror threat that was ubiquitous in character, apocalyptic in scale and imminent in nature. Only then혻could they counterpose human rights against security as though they were not only contradictory but mutually exclusive.
Al-Qaida was only too happy to oblige. In such a state of perpetual crisis혻both terrorists and reactionaries thrive. Terrorists successfully create a climate of fear; governments successfully exploit that fear to extend their own powers.
"I'm absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it," said former vice-president Dick Cheney.
The trouble is that even by their own shabby standards, none of these "extraordinary measures" have ever worked. No new laws were necessary to stop 9/11. If the immigration services, the FBI and the CIA had been doing their jobs properly, the attacks could have been prevented.
Nonetheless, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 the US government undertook the "preventative detention" of about 5,000 men on the basis of their birthplace and later sought a further 19,000 "voluntary interviews". Over the next year, more than 170,000 men from 24 predominantly Muslim countries and North Korea were fingerprinted and interviewed in a programme of "special registration". None of these produced a single terrorism conviction.
This set the pattern for the years to come: wiretapping, rendition, torture, secrecy. Those who otherwise rail against the inefficiency of government argued for more extensive, intrusive state power even as it produced little in the way of results. When confronted with this lamentable record, their only defence was the threat of the next attack. "The next time, the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud" said Condoleezza Rice, adding. "They only have to be right once. We have to be right every time." Over the last week even once in a while would have looked good.
There are precious few partisan points to be made here. Responsibility for Abdulmutallab lies with Obama. He has been in power longer than Bush was when he received the FBI memo entitled "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the US". The Bush administration may have been more alarmist and belligerent, but, despite his more emollient tone, Obama has kept most of the repressive apparatus that Bush constructed intact. Obama has expressed his support for trying Guant찼namo prisoners under military commissions, while his CIA chief has expressed his desire to keep extraordinary rendition. Meanwhile, photographs of torture and documents describing videos of these "enhanced interrogations" remain under lock and key.
"Leon Panetta has been captured by혻the people who were the ideological drivers for the interrogation program in the first place," a former CIA officer told the Washington Post. Casting the혻escalation of the Afghanistan war as a central front in the war on terror is a potent illustration of how this delusion has continued. Al-Qaida is now more likely to be found in Pakistan, an American ally, than in Afghanistan and the latest threat came via Yemen. Terrorism is a strategy, not a place �� attempts to carpet-bomb it or occupy it or conquer it will inevitably fail.
Given the nature of terrorism another attack can be predicted with grim certainty. Before 9/11 there was Oklahoma City and before that there was the World Trade Centre. In a nation where the shooting of innocents in schools, colleges, churches and coffee shops is relatively commonplace, it goes without saying that one disturbed individual, with a lethal weapon and with or without an agenda, can inflict a substantial amount of human carnage. If they are working in a team and well resourced, the damage could be huge. All the state can reasonably expect to do is limit the odds.
The US has actually done the opposite. Thanks to war and torture it has swelled the number of people who might want to do it harm. Much has been made of Abdulmutallab's radicalisation in London. But there had to be something to radicalise him with. In Abu Ghraib, Haditha, Fallujah and elsewhere, the US has provided plenty of material.
Meanwhile the institutional stasis within the agencies that are supposed to combat terrorism means that when혻a혻potential terrorist actually does rear their head they appear on every radar and yet somehow, all too often, go혻undetected.
So instead of reducing the odds politicians instead invoke them. "If there's a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaida build or develop a nuclear weapon," Cheney once said, "we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response. It's not about our analysis ... It's about our response". But it's precisely because their analysis has been so deeply flawed that their response has been so faulty. Until things improve there is a much higher chance that America's anti-terror efforts will repeat themselves: first as farce and then as human tragedy.
The White House has distributed a list of 78 terrorist attacks to support Donald Trump�셲 claim that the media is failing to properly report them.
But the list includes many atrocities that received blanket western media coverage including the Paris Bataclan attacks, the Nice truck killings and the San Bernardino shootings.
Many others including the Sydney siege and Germany�셲 Christmas market attack received wide international coverage.
The list also includes multiple errors and spelling mistakes, including �쏶an Bernadino��, and excludes numerous terror attacks across the Middle East.
The release comes after the US president told military leaders in Tampa, Florida, on Monday that there have been attacks all over Europe but �쐇n many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn�셳 want to report it��. He added: �쏷hey have their reasons, and you understand that,�� but did not expand.
Later the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about specific attacks that had not been reported, to which he replied: �쏻e�셪l provide a list later. There�셲 several instances �� There�셲 a lot of instances that have occurred where I don�셳 think they�셶e gotten the coverage it deserved.��
That list, released to media outlets including the Guardian, included a �쐔imeline�� of domestic and international incidents from September 2014 to December 2016.
Some, such as last year�셲 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and the killing of 129 people in Paris in November 2015, received huge coverage. But officials claimed that �쐌ost�� of the attacks were not adequately reported by western media outlets, CNN reported.
The list hops from Afghanistan to Algeria to Australia but, without explanation, does not mention Israel, where incidents included a bus bombing in Jerusalem last year, carried out by a 19-year-old Palestinian, that injured 20 people.
A December 2016 cut-off also excludes the Qu챕bec City mosque attack from the list, an attack Trump was publicly silent about, despite condemning on Twitter the Louvre attack in Paris several days later.
The murder of British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung in an Australian hostel last year was also included on the list, even though extremism had been ruled out as a motive by both police and the victim�셲 mother.
In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accused Donald Trump of using �쐄ake news�� about her daughter�셲 death to further the �쐏ersecution of innocent people�� by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack.
�쏮y daughter�셲 death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,�� she wrote.
The document also includes spelling mistakes such as �쏿ttaker�� instead of �쏿ttacker�� and �쏡enmakr�� instead of �쏡enmark��.
There have been similar errors in official communications in recent days, including references to Theresa May as �쏷eresa�� and a reference to Malcolm Turnbull as the �쐏resident�� of Australia when it should be �쐏rime minister��.
The catalogue begins with an attack by Abdul Numan Haider, who wounded two police officers in a knife attack in Melbourne in September 2014. It ends with an atrocity involving Anis Amri, who drove a truck into a crowded market in Berlin last December, killing 12 and injuring 48.
Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesperson, claimed that the list demonstrates how terrorist attacks are losing perceived news value because of their frequency. �쏷he real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,�� she said via email.
�쏧f you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they�셱e happening so often �� at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list �� that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did.
�쏷his cannot be allowed to become the �쁭ew normal��, and the President, for one, is not going to be satisfied until the American people are much safer and more secure.��
Earlier, Spicer told reporters travelling on Air Force One that Trump believes attacks are not �쐕nreported�� but �쐕nder-reported��.
He said: �쏦e felt members of the media don�셳 always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered.��
But David Gergen, a political analyst and former adviser to four US presidents, condemned Trump�셲 remarks.
�쏧 think this is one of the most outrageous claims the president has made, among many, because it really says, basically, that the press is not doing its job because it has its own political agenda,�� he told CNN. �쏧t doesn�셳 want you to know the truth about how dangerous terrorism is. It doesn�셳 want to be out there, it�셲 just pulling a leftist agenda on you, which is clearly not true.��
Gergen added: �쏦e engages in these falsehoods without producing any serious evidence. The list includes San Bernardino, as if the press didn�셳 cover that sufficiently. It�셲 just astonishing and it�셲 beneath the dignity of the presidency and I think it tears at the fabric of what holds us together as a people when we can�셳 trust each other, we can�셳 trust the White House, and he�셲 telling us we can�셳 trust the press. This is the way democracies come unravelled.��
Police have ramped up security at Australian airports after foiling what they described as a credible and �쐃laborate�� plan to detonate a bomb on a plane.
Tougher security has now been implemented at Australian airports, including additional screening of bags, and police say the current counter-terrorism operation may last days.
The four men arrested in raids on five properties in the Sydney suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl on Saturday night have not yet been charged.
The Australian federal police commissioner, Andrew Colvin, said a tip-off from partner agencies led to the raids on Saturday night. He said the terrorist attack planned to use an �쐇mprovised device�� to target an Australian plane.
He said the threat was credible, adding: �쏻e believe it�셲 Islamic-inspired terrorism. Exactly what is behind this is something we need to investigate fully.��
Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the foiled operation was not a lone wolf-style attack. �쏻e face a range of terrorist threats, some of them are lone actors, who activate very quickly, with very little warning,�� Turnbull said on Sunday. �쏰n other occasions, you get quite elaborate conspiracies. This appears to be in that category.��
The attack was to target the Australian aviation industry at a major airport, police said. Colvin said there was no evidence that security at Australian airports had been compromised. �쏷errorists are becoming very ingenious about ways to defeat our security mechanisms,�� he said.
�쏛ustralia has some of the best, if not the best airport security arrangements in the world and we�셱e confident those measures are effective, and would have been effective, in this circumstance.��
The searches in Sydney will continue in coming days. Police said a �쐍umber of items of great interest�� have been seized.
The Seven Network reported a suspicious device was found in a Surry Hills terrace, which was raided by 40 riot squad officers on Saturday.
TV footage showed a man with a bandage on his head and draped in a blanket being led away by authorities.
A neighbour described the family who lived in the house in Cleveland Street as �쐏erfectly nice and normal people��.
�쏻e knew them to say hello to and they seemed nice,�� the woman, who didn�셳 want to be identified, told AAP.
Colvin would not say whether the four men were on a terror watch list.
Turnbull said the additional security and screening measures at Australian airports may cause delays to travellers. �쏮ore bags will be checked, it�셲 really intensifying what we�셱e already doing,�� he said. And that will be, some of that will be visible, some of it will not be visible.��
Virgin Australia issued a statement advising passengers to arrive at the airport two hours before a domestic flight and three hours before an international flight. Virgin also asked passengers to limit carry-on baggage where possible.
�쏷he travelling public can expect to experience an increased level of security scrutiny at the airport but they should not be concerned about these precautionary measures,�� the airline�셲 statement said.
�쏛s the measures place an additional burden on the screening system, it may take a little longer than usual to get through the process.��
The prime minister said he was being briefed on the operation�셲 progress by security agencies.
Australia�셲 national terrorism threat advisory system lists the threat level as �쐏robable��, and Turnbull said that would not change immediately.
NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said police may have waited another week before raiding the homes, had it not been terror-related. �쏷he reality with terrorism, you can�셳 wait till you put the whole puzzle together. If you get it wrong, the consequences are severe.
�쏻e risk assess regularly, around the clock, and you need to make a decision at some stage when it the right time to go. Both Australian Federal Police and New South Wales police agreed last night was the right time to go.��
Justice minister, Michael Keenan, said the foiled plot was the 13th significant counter-terrorism disruption in Australia.
French anti-terror officials have launched an investigation after a man known to the security services shot at a police officer in northern Paris before travelling across the city to Orly airport, where he was killed following an altercation with another officer.
The attacker was said to be a radicalised Muslim who appeared on a security watchlist, police sources told Reuters. France�셲 anti-terrorism prosecutor later confirmed that an inquiry had been opened into the incident on Saturday morning.
The suspect was identified by a security official as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, a 39-year-old born in France, the Associated Press reported.
Prosecutors said the suspect�셲 house was among scores searched in November 2015 in the immediate aftermath of terror attacks in Paris in which 130 people were killed. Those searches targeted people with suspected radical leanings.
The suspect�셲 father and brother were detained by police for questioning on Saturday.
The French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, said the investigation would determine whether the Orly attacker �쐆ad a terrorist plot behind him��.
The French defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the attacker had assaulted a patrol of three air force soldiers, one of whom was a woman.
The attacker wrestled her to the floor and tried to take her weapon, but she was able to keep hold of it. The two other soldiers then opened fire to protect her and passengers in the airport, he said.
The air force personnel were deployed as part of Sentinelle, a military operation launched in January 2015 after the Paris terrorist attacks to support the police and protect sensitive sites.
The interior minister, Bruno Le Roux, said the man shot dead at the airport was linked with a car-jacking incident earlier on Saturday in a northern suburb of Paris. He said the man had shot at a female police officer after being stopped for speeding before fleeing the scene and stealing a car at gunpoint.
Le Roux said the officer had not been badly injured.
No explosive devices were found on the dead man�셲 body, an interior ministry spokesman said.
About 3,000 people were evacuated from both terminals at Orly and all flights were suspended, with some diverted to Charles de Gaulle airport. Some flights began operating again early Saturday afternoon. No one else was injured in the Orly incident.
The airport shooting follows after a similar incident last month at the Louvre museum in central Paris.
France remains under a state of emergency in the wake of the attack on the Bataclan music venue in November 2015 in which jihadi gunmen killed 90 people, and the Nice truck attack last July that claimed the lives of 84 people and injured hundreds more.
On a visit to Paris on Saturday the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met survivors of the Bataclan attack, praising their bravery and the �쏿mazing progress�� of their recovery.
The royal couple met a 25-year-old, known only as Jessica, who was shot seven times in the leg, hip and back as she dined with friends at La Belle Equipe restaurant, and Kevin, 28, a Bataclan concert-goer shot in the leg.
The couple visited the hospital where the pair have been treated as reports of the incident at Orly airport emerged. A Kensington Palace spokesman said the royal visit was unaffected.
Etihad Airways is assisting with the investigation into an alleged Sydney-based conspiracy to bring down an aircraft as a leading terror expert suggests the suspects may been building a gas bomb like that used in Manchester.
Four men remain in custody over the alleged plot which US officials believe was �쐄airly well along�� when Australian authorities swooped on Saturday.
Reuters cited two US officials familiar with the arrests as also saying the Australian investigation wasn�셳 a sting operation but the result of the alleged detection of a developing plot.
�쏷he Etihad Airways aviation security team is assisting the AFP with its investigation and the matter is ongoing,�� the airline said in a statement.
�쏣tihad is complying fully with the enhanced security measures at airports in Australia and monitoring the situation closely.��
Investigators on Monday found a Qantas release slip relating to a Sydney to Jakarta flight near one of the raided Sydney properties but it is understood the alleged plot did not involve Qantas or the Qantas Group.
Authorities have refused to officially confirm any details about what they�셶e found after searching properties in four Sydney suburbs.
However, one theory is the plot involved the use of a meat grinder to conceal a home-made device.
Deakin University terror expert Greg Barton suggests the plan may have centred around acetone peroxide �� or TATP �� the same chemical used in the Manchester Arena bombing in May and the 2015 Paris attacks.
Referred to as the �쐌other of Satan�� because it can kill those handling it, TATP is unstable but powerful and would not give off �쐔ell-tale�� chemicals picked up by airport swab tests, Prof Barton said.
�쏷hat makes it a candidate for using in this sort of attack.��
TATP, which needs a pressure vessel to be packed in, could be placed in a grinder so it was opaque through an X-ray machine and appeared innocuous upon visual inspection.
�쏧t might just pass (security),�� Prof Barton said. �쏷hat, I�셫 guessing, was their plan.��
Barton speculated while the alleged plot could have succeeded it more likely would have failed because the bomb would have been detected, failed to detonate or not have detonated to its full potential.
Other US officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said communications between the alleged plotters in Sydney and members of Islamic State in Syria were intercepted by a foreign intelligence service.
The US officials declined to identify the service and United Kingdom officials refused to confirm or deny playing a role in detecting the alleged plot.
Australian National University intelligence expert Professor John Blaxland says relying on international tip-offs shouldn�셳 raise questions about the adequacy of Australia�셲 intelligence services.
�쏻hat we know is that organisations like the AFP and Asio have extensive networks of connections and liaisons arrangements with counterparts globally,�� Blaxland said. �쏷here�셲 a mutual benefit �� a mutual back-scratching exercise.
�쏷hat network is proving more and more useful and more and more important for countering potential terrorist acts.��
Several terrorists remain at large in Brussels and threaten to commit a �쐖ery dangerous act��, a senior official has said, as the Belgian capital enters its second day with soldiers and armoured vehicles continuing to keep the city in lockdown.
The mayor of one of Brussels�� municipalities said the area was still facing a grave threat, adding that suspects linked to the Paris terror attack that killed more than 130 last week remain on the run.
Schaerbeek�셲 mayor, Bernard Clerfayt, said on Sunday: �쏷here are two terrorists in the Brussels region that could commit very dangerous acts.�� The Belgian interior minister, Jan Jambon, added �쐓everal suspects�� tied to the Paris attacks could be at large in the country.
Belgium�셲 national crisis centre on Saturday raised the threat alert in the Brussels region to level four, which indicates a �쐓erious and immediate threat��. Clerfayt said it was necessary to try to anticipate and prevent any such acts and their consequences. He said: �쏛s long as this threat is present, we must be very attentive.��
Officials said several men were being sought by security authorities amid speculation that a series of cells may be planning attacks in the heart of the EU.
The city�셲 metro system remained closed on Sunday. Officials were due to meet at noon to decide whether to relax the stringent measures, which have seen public transport restricted, shops shut, shopping malls shuttered, professional football cancelled, concerts called off and music venues, museums, and galleries closed.
A series of scares over suspect packages also raised tensions.
Belgian authorities are searching for Salah Abdeslam, identified as a key organiser of the gun and bomb attacks that killed 130 people in Paris nine days ago. Belgian media have reported sightings of Abdeslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman, in or around Brussels.
However Jambon told reporters that a number of suspects were sought, not just Abdeslam. �쏷here are several suspects, that�셲 why we have put in place such a concentration of resources. We are following the situation minute by minute. There�셲 is no point in hiding that there is a real threat, but we are doing everything we can, day and night, to counter this situation,�� Jambon said.
On Friday the Belgian security and counter-terror services warned the government, on the basis of undisclosed evidence, that a major attack was being planned in Brussels.
�쏤ollowing a new assessment, the terror alert level has been raised to level four, very serious, for the Brussels region,�� said a government statement. �쏛nalysis shows a serious and imminent threat that requires taking specific security measures as well as specific recommendations for the public.��
The rest of the country was put on a level three alert, one level short of the maximum. People were told to avoid rail stations and airports, shopping centres, concerts, and other public events where people congregate.
Belgian officials have rejected widespread criticism of its intelligence services and counter-terror efforts. The news that a Belgian man suspected of undertaking reconnaissance of targets for the Paris attacks has been held by Turkish police have underlined the role the country has played as a base for those behind the plot, however.
Speaking to Belgian TV on Saturday night, Carine Coquelet, the lawyer of one of the two men detained in Brussels last week, said her client admitted picking up Abdeslam in Paris shortly after the terrorist strike there and driving him back to Brussels. She said that Abdelsalam may have been wearing a belt of explosives under a coat.
Belgium reportedly supplies the most foreign fighters to Syria compared to other EU countries in per capita terms. Many have come from Molenbeek, a run-down Brussels borough with a large Muslim community that has long been a concern.
Jambon, a Flemish nationalist, said that of 130 foreign fighters who were known to have come home from Syria, 85 were living in Molenbeek, which lies just west of the city centre. He demanded that the local authorities conduct a �쐂oor-by-door�� vetting of who was living in every house and flat in the borough.
The mayors of Brussels�� 19 boroughs met at least twice and recommended a thorough lockdown of the city, not all of which was observed. A city centre mayor announced that a popular local market had been cancelled. In fact, it was operating as normal.
The Sunday morning market at the Gare du Midi, the Eurostar terminal �� one of the biggest outdoor markets in Europe �� was called off. Busy trains from Paris were subject to extra security measures.
It appeared many of the cancellations and closures were meant to relieve pressure on the security forces, who would be stretched too thin if mobilised to cover public events. Armed police as well as army personnel patrolled the central streets on foot, while armoured vehicles were a common sight.
The US embassy in Brussels advised Americans to cancel their weekend plans. �쏶helter in place and remain at home. If you must go out, avoid large crowds. US citizens are urged to avoid public places such as major pedestrian walkways and shopping centres. If you were planning to attend an event, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Exercise caution in public transportation systems, sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas, shopping malls and other tourist destinations.��
The Foreign Office delivered similar advice for the high numbers of Britons in Brussels, which is also home to the Nato headquarters.
Yet for all the square-jawed resolution on display in western capitals about the prosecution of this war, there is little agreement even within the heart of the coalition about what terrorism actually means. Both the EU and the UN are struggling to come up with an acceptable definition. The European Commission has produced a formulation so broad it would include anti-globalisation protesters who smash McDonald's windows; while Kofi Annan, UN secretary-general, warned wearily that reaching a consensus would be well-nigh impossible since "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter". President Bush has pledged that the war will not cease so long as "anybody is terrorising established governments" and Britain's latest terrorism legislation outlaws support for groups opposing any regime, including an illegal one, with violence.
Pacifists apart, however, virtually everyone across the political spectrum supports terrorism in practice - or, rather, what passes for terrorism under the rubric being promulgated by western chancelleries. The transformation from terrorist to respected statesman has become a cliche of the international politics of the past 50 years, now being replayed in Northern Ireland. Almost every society, philosophy and religion has recognised the right to take up arms against tyranny or foreign occupation. In History Will Absolve Me, his 1953 trial speech after the abortive Moncada barracks attack, Fidel Castro reels off a string of thinkers and theologians - from Thomas Aquinas and John Salisbury to John Calvin and Thomas Paine - who defended the right to rebel against despots. In modern times, few would question the heroism or justice of the wartime resistance to the Nazis or of armed rebellions against British or French colonial rule, all damned as terrorists by those they fought.
More recently still, the US government trained and funded the armed contra rebellion against Nicaragua - ably assisted by John Negroponte, the current US ambassador to the UN and in defiance of the international court in the Hague. Along with its faithful British ally, the US also backed the Afghan mojahedin (even before the Soviet intervention), as it is now funding opposition groups waging bombing campaigns in Iraq. So the Bush administration's problem with terrorism is evidently not about breaking the state's monopoly of violence.
The right to resist occupation is in any case recognised under international law and the Geneva convention, which is one reason why routine western denunciations of Palestinian violence ring so utterly hollow. Having failed to dislodge the Israeli occupation after 34 years or implement the UN decision to create a Palestinian state after 54 years, there are few reasonable grounds to complain if those living under the occupation fight back. But the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian, which last week assassinated Israel's racist tourism minister in response to the Israeli assassination of its leader in August, is officially regarded as a terrorist organisation by the US government, which has now successfully pressured the Palestinian leadership to ban its military wing.
The tendency in recent years, encouraged by the scale of last month's atrocity in New York, has been to define terrorism increasingly in terms of methods and tactics - particularly the targeting of civilians - rather than the status of those who carry it out. Such an approach has its own difficulties. Liberation movements which most would balk at branding terrorist, including the ANC and the Algerian FLN, attacked civilian targets - as so mesmerisingly portrayed in Pontecorvo's film Battle of Algiers. But more problematic for western governments is the way such arguments can be turned against them. The concept of modern terrorism derives, after all, from the French revolution, where terror was administered by the state - as it is today by scores of governments around the world.
If paramilitary groups become terrorists because they kill or injure civilians, what of those states which bomb television stations, bridges and power stations, train and arm death squads or authorise assassinations? After days when hundreds of Afghan civilians are reported to have died as a result of Anglo-American bombardment - while hundreds of thousands are fleeing for their lives - Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's remark that the aim was to "frighten" the other side couldn't have more sharply posed the paradox of terror.
In his City of God, Saint Augustine tells a story about an encounter between Alexander the Great (the last ruler successfully to garrison Afghanistan) and a pirate captain he had caught on the high seas. Ordering the pirate to heave to, Alexander demands: "How dare you molest the seas as a pirate?" "How dare you molest the whole world?" retorts the plucky pirate. "I have a small boat, so I am called a thief and a pirate. You have a great navy, so you are called an emperor, and can call other men pirates." Substitute terrorist or rogue state for pirate and the episode neatly encapsulates the morality of the new world order.
Political violence emerges when other avenues are closed. Where people suffer oppression, are denied a peaceful route to justice and social change and have exhausted all other tactics - the point the ANC reached in the early 1960s - they are surely entitled to use force. That does not apply to adventurist and socially disconnected groups like Baader Meinhof or the Red Brigades, nor does it deal with the question of whether such force is advisable or likely to be counter-productive. Islamist "jihad" groups, especially networks like al-Qaida with a "global reach" and a religious ideology impervious to accommodation, are considered by many to be beyond any normal calculus of repression and resistance. Certainly, the September 11 atrocity was an unprecedented act of non-state terror. But such groups are also unquestionably the product of conditions in the Arab and Muslim world for which both Britain and the US bear a heavy responsibility, through their unswerving support of despotic regimes for over half a century. It was precisely that blockage of democratic development that led to the failure of secular politics, which in turn paved the way for the growth of Islamist radicalism. Groups like al-Qaida offer no future to the Muslim world, but Bin Laden and his supporters have their boots sunk deep in a swamp of grievance. As the assault on Afghanistan continues, no one should delude themselves that cutting off al-Qaida's head or destroying its Afghan lair will put an end to this eruption.
June 1995 Chechen rebels seize hundreds of hostages in a hospital in the southern Russian town of Budennovsk. More than 100 people are killed during the assault and a botched Russian commando raid.
January 1996 Chechen fighters take hundreds hostage in another hospital, this time in Kizlyar, Dagestan, and move them by bus to Pervomayskoye on the Chechen border. Most rebels escape but many hostages are killed during a rescue attempt.
September 1999 Bombs destroy apartment blocks in Moscow, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk. More than 200 people are killed. Moscow blames Chechens who in turn blame Russian secret services.
23-26 October 2002 Russian troops storm a Moscow theatre where rebels had taken 700 people captive three days earlier; 129 hostages and 41 Chechen guerrillas are killed. Most of the hostages die from the effects of gas used against the Chechens.
1 August 2003 A suicide bomber driving a truck packed with explosives blows up a military hospital at Mozdok in North Ossetia, bordering Chechnya. Fifty people are killed.
5 December 2003 An explosion tears through a morning commuter train just outside Yessentuki station in Russia's southern fringe, killing 46 people and injuring 160.
6 February 2004 A suicide bombing kills at least 39 people and wounds more than 100 on an underground train in Moscow.
22 June 2004 Rebels seize an interior ministry building in Ingushetia, near Chechnya, and attack other locations. At least 92 people are killed including the acting regional interior minister Abukar Kostoyev.
24 August 2004 Two Russian passenger planes are blown up almost simultaneously, killing 90 people. One Tu-134, flying to Volgograd, goes down south of Moscow. Moments later a Tu-154 bound for Sochi crashes near Rostov-on-Don.
1-3 September 2004 331 hostages �� half of them children �� die in a chaotic storming of a school in Beslan, after it is seized by rebels demanding Chechen independence.
17 August 2009 A suicide bomber drives a truck into the gates of the main police station in Nazran, the largest city in Ingushetia, killing 20 people and wounding 138 others.
29 March 2010 Moscow suffers its worst attack in six years when two female suicide bombers from Russia's volatile Dagestan region set off explosives on the subway system, killing 40 people.
India is facing a period of heightened terrorist threat due to internal, regional and global factors, security officials say. Six years on from the bloody attack on luxury hotels and other targets in the country�셲 commercial capital, Mumbai, local and international officials say a pause in spectacular attacks in India could be broken at any moment.
�쏷here are storm clouds gathering,�� one western official told the Guardian, echoing warnings from others based in the US and the UK this year.
The forthcoming drawdown of US combat troops in Afghanistan, the weakness of the elected government in neighbouring Pakistan, the radicalising effect of the surge of Islamic State in the Middle East, as well as competition between local groups including al-Qaida, have all combined to raise the risk of a new strike to its highest for many years, the officials said. �쏷here is a pause [but] this is a more challenging situation now,�� one senior police officer in Mumbai told the Guardian.
One new trend is sympathy for Islamic State among a small segment of local Muslim youth. Estimates of how many Indians have travelled to join the Isis vary from around 50 to 200. �쏷here are a growing number of youngsters who want to join jihad. It was there before but they went only to Pakistan. Now there is a global element,�� the Mumbai-based officer said.
This year four men from the northern Mumbai suburb of Kalyan travelled to Iraq to join Isis. The total number of Indians who have tried to travel to the Middle East to fight is unclear as many local police forces prefer not to officially register cases against individuals but to rely on family pressure to �쐂issuade and deradicalise�� them, a senior Mumbai policeman said.
The policy of avoiding criminalising prospective Isis volunteers is opposed by national-level intelligence agencies who believe it may encourage extremism by allowing aspirant militants to avoid any sanction. Supporters of the policy say it avoids further radicalisation and involves communities in the fight against radical influence.
In one recent case, a young man was stopped from boarding a flight to the Middle East at Mumbai airport and returned to his family without legal proceedings being initiated, police officers in Mumbai said. �쏦is father worried that if he was charged his sisters could never get married due to the social stigma, so we are using family pressure to make sure he is kept in line,�� one involved in the case explained.
In Hyderabad two weeks ago a software engineer suspected of planning to join Isis was detained and then �쏿sked to desist from such things,�� according to the local PTI news agency.
Some aspirant militants are believed to have avoided surveillance by Indian authorities. Many are thought to have travelled from countries in the Gulf, where large numbers of Indians are working on temporary contracts.
MK Narayan, a former national security adviser, recently claimed that up to 150 Indians were fighting with Isis, though security officials in Delhi said this was exaggerated. They said claims by Isis leaders that there were large numbers of Indians in their ranks were also untrue.
All interviewees stressed that the numbers attracted by extremist ideologies remained negligible compared to India�셲 Muslim population of 180 million, around 14% of the country�셲 overall population of 1.26 billion. �쏧t�셲 a wake-up call but in a larger perspective it doesn�셳 indicate that a lot of radicalisation has taken place,�� a senior police officer in Mumbai said.
However, there are other factors combining to raise fears. Many officials are concerned that existing militant groups, mostly based in Pakistan, who have been active against international troops in Afghanistan over the 13 years of the conflict there may turn their attention to India once most of the international forces have left. Only about 12,500 troops, comprising mostly US trainers and advisers, will remain next year. �쏷here is a huge trained manpower that they will not know what to do with and this will unleash acts of terror and we are a good target,�� the officer said.
Groups active in Afghanistan include Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), the Pakistan-based organisation behind the 2008 attacks on Mumbai. Michael Kugelman, of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said the Afghan factor was �쐔he big one��. �쏽ou have all these militants who are anti-Indian at root in search of a new target. That�셲 the obvious threat,�� Kugelman said.
Another concern is the handful of Indians who have travelled to Pakistan to join or establish new factions in recent years. These include the remnants of the Indian mujahideen, a series of linked groups that emerged around a decade ago. The network has now fractured under intense pressure from Indian security services. Both the two main remaining factions are based in Pakistan: one is reported to be based in the southern port city of Karachi and under the supervision of Pakistani security services there, and the other is increasingly close to al-Qaida, officials in Delhi believe.
Al-Qaida, under the leadership of Ayman al-Zawahiri, recently announced the foundation of a new affiliate in the Asian subcontinent. An attempt by militants to take over a Pakistani navy frigate in port in Karachi shortly after that announcement failed �� but only just, western officials in Delhi said.
The extremists�� exact plan is unknown but one suggestion is that the warship�셲 missiles would have been turned on US or other shipping �� civilian and military �� in the Arabian Sea. The plot involved navy servicemen who hid in a storeroom that is usually left locked at the end of a day, with the aim of taking charge of the warship during the night, officials told the Guardian. They were discovered by chance and killed in a firefight. �쏧t was pure luck that they were found. Otherwise it could have been much worse,�� one of the officials said.
As Islamic State, a rival to al-Qaida within the broad movement of Sunni Muslim extremism, continues to build its influence and recognition in the south Asian region, experts say it is likely that al-Qaida will make increasing efforts to prove its contemporary credentials through spectacular attacks. Asim Umar, the leader of the new al-Qaida affiliate on the sub-continent, has repeatedly indicated an interest in attacking India, leading some to suggest he is of Indian origin.
Kugelman said: �쏻ith [the announcement] of al-Qaida in south Asia, India is definitely in the cross-hairs although it is unclear if they have the capacity to strike.��
Most previous al-Qaida affiliates have involved existing groups, often with proven records of violence and deep roots in a particular region. In India this has not happened. As a result, any capability would depend on establishing networks themselves, which would be difficult, using what is left of the Indian mujahideen or other similar local groups or working with groups in Pakistan. Another possibility, highlighted by Indian intelligence services in recent months, is a linkup with groups based in Bangladesh, the populous and poverty-hit state to the east, which has suffered intermittent bouts of extremist violence over the last decade.
Legal documents and an Indian intelligence dossier on Sayed Zabiuddin Ansari, also known as Abu Jindal, a key figure in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, give a glimpse of how overseas groups and internal militants collaborate. Born in 1981 in a remote part of Maharashtra, the central India state which includes Mumbai, Ansari was recruited into LeT in 2005 by a local man in the city of Aurangabad.
�쏷hey discussed about atrocities on Muslims in India and also about the future plans against such atrocities. They discussed that jihad is the correct way to be adopted in this regard,�� the dossier says. The men travelled to Nepal where they met other operatives of LeT, who gave Ansari explosives training and money.
A police crackdown following a bombing orchestrated by Ansari in 2006 forced Ansari to flee to Pakistan via Bangladesh. He went on to play a key role in the Mumbai attacks two years later before eventually travelling to Saudi Arabia to recruit for LeT among Indian workers there. Detained by the kingdom�셲 security services, he was deported to India last summer.
Other legal documents seen by the Guardian underline the importance of Pakistan-based groups in providing critical expertise and resources to otherwise amateur Indian networks. Veteran Indian militants who have found a safe haven in the neighbouring country are implicated in some attacks as well.
However, many cases within India show how homegrown extremists carry out acts of violence without overseas assistance. Police documents show that a series of bombings in the northern city of Patna that killed six and injured 89 in October last year was the work of two new recruits to an extensive network based in north and central India that has been present for more than a decade.
The network is also behind an earlier attack on the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Bodh Gaya, close to Patna, the documents say. The police investigation in each case uncovered an ad hoc system of local activists who could provide direction, logistical support and safehouses and run basic training camps. Militants were arrested in towns and cities across the north of India, including the capital, Delhi.
The documents also reveal how a belief that the Muslim community in India is the victim of discrimination and worse can fuel extremism in the emerging economic power. The dossier on Ansari describes how his decision to join LeT was prompted in part by violence in Gujarat in 2002 in which 1,000 people, largely Muslims, died. Following the incident �쐆e felt insecure about Muslims,�� it says.
The Patna bombings targeted campaign rallies by Narendra Modi, leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which went on to win a landslide victory in elections this May. Many Muslims in India blame Modi, who was chief minister of the state at the time, for the violence in Gujarat.
Reports filed by the police about the attack describe the confession of one leading member of the network responsible that he had instructed recruits to �쐔ake revenge against a series of rightwing figures, including Narendra Modi, or their [prayers] will not be accepted,�� the document says.
A further factor was an outbreak of sectarian violence in northern India shortly before the attacks. �쏷he communal violence of Muzaffarnagar [a village in northern India that saw extensive sectarian clashes last year] was also discussed [by network leaders]. They decided to plan and take revenge,�� the document states.
Kugelman, the Washington-based analyst, said sectarian tensions were separate from jihadist militancy. �쏧f you have increased tensions it doesn�셳 suggest you will have a new generation of jihadis. Since Modi took office there are more communal tensions but that�셲 a long way off another Mumbai,�� he said.
Few in the Indian commercial capital have forgotten the events of 26 November 2008 when a team of gunmen landed by sea in a hijacked fishing boat and launched attacks on luxury hotels, a Jewish centre, commuters at the main railway station and a cafe favoured by tourists. In all, 164 people died and hundreds more were injured in four days of fighting.
Fears of communal tensions in the aftermath of the attack proved baseless and security officials and Muslim leaders in Mumbai say relations between faith communities remain good despite the unexpected success of a vocal political party representing Muslims at recent state elections.
�쏻e are all getting on very well, better than ever in 20 years, even better after the attacks [of 2008]. We feel that in the Hindu community the majority are secular and only a handful of mischievous people are trying to create a rift,�� said Gulzar Ahmed Azmi, of the Jamiat Ulama e Maharashtra, a Muslim political association in the city.
Police in Mumbai have made efforts to improve relations with the Muslim community. On Saturday, senior officers joined community leaders for an event held at the Gateway of India, yards from the Taj Hotel that was a principal target of the 2008 attacks.
However, Azmi and others said that a series of terrorist cases in recent years in which Muslims had been suspected, investigated and often incarcerated for long periods before being acquitted had damaged trust in the police and, more broadly, the government.
Ejaz Abbas Naqvi, a Mumbai lawyer who has represented men accused of terrorism, said that though �쐔he majority of Muslims believe that anyone arrested is innocent��, there was still 100% faith in the judiciary.
He agreed with the broad consensus among experts and officials. �쏷he blasts are down [in number] but the reality is the threats are existing �� Everyone is on [the] alert,�� he said.
�� There will be live NDTV-Guardian Cities discussion on Mumbai�셲 terror threat at 1.30pm GMT (7pm IST) on Wednesday. Watch it at theguardian.com/cities
As the UK ached with the suffering inflicted by two terrorist attacks in quick succession, some readers expressed a feeling that is as understandable as it must be widespread: just let it stop.
The images, descriptions and background information about the London Bridge attack, which journalists worked hard to gather, were thought by some to worsen the suffering and even to assist the terrorists.
�쏥et those names and photos of those murderous cowards off your front page,�� wrote one reader. �쏤ame, even posthumous, is what they want, and currently newspapers and other news sources are giving them exactly that,�� said another.
A third reader recognised the importance of the news but wanted better warnings, not only on distressing images but on articles containing descriptions of the attack: �쏧 seem to recall the Guardian using these disclaimers before, and I know they still do for graphic videos, so I�셫 not sure why detailed accounts of stabbings �� by eyewitnesses who are still in shock �� shouldn�셳 receive the same treatment.��
These are matters of degree and of judgment. I believe the Guardian has been consistently making good judgments in testing circumstances. For example, the video on the website of the police shooting dead the three perpetrators did not begin automatically, contained a clear warning of what to expect, and was less graphic than it might have been.
I asked the deputy editor, Paul Johnson, about the Guardian�셲 overall approach, and he responded: �쏻e have well established guidelines around the use of terror photographs �� including that they should not be used in any way that is gratuitous or glorifies terror. Balancing that, there is significant public interest around the identities and background of perpetrators, the role of the security services and the reaction of politicians. Much of our reporting seeks to uncover the journeys that end in such violence.
�쏰n the site, we use perpetrators�� photographs according to news value, often dispersed in a carousel of other photographs. [A carousel is a jargon term for a moving cycle of images.]
�쏧n print, there have been 14 editions of the newspaper since the Manchester bombing. We have led on terror 10 times and on the front page we have used just one photograph of an attacker �� and that as a single column [6 June]. On three occasions we have led with photographs of victims.��
When the images of perpetrators resemble mugshots they have an apt criminal connotation. I believe that a ban on naming perpetrators or showing their images would be counterproductive. Identifying them can prompt people to come forward with information which may assist investigations. But, as most advice on media coverage of terrorism suggests, it is important not to glamorise terrorists or allow them to seem antiheroes or �쐌asterminds��. The better coverage avoids using terrorists�� self-circulated images, which tend to show them uniformed, draped in flags, displaying propaganda signs, or affecting a pious religiosity so as to associate a faith with a crime.
The images and stories about victims, those who courageously fight back, who steadfastly bear witness, who calmly give aid and comfort to the injured and bereaved �� all this needs to be gathered and presented in ways that take into account human dignity, vulnerability, fresh grief. But it is all necessary journalism, as explained in the academic report Fanning the Flames: Reporting Terror in a Networked World: �쏪ournalism around terror events also has a role in mediating the emotional impact for the audience. There is an element of useful ritual about the creation of instant shrines at the scene of incidents, the memorial services, and the expressions of condolence. Social media and platforms now play a part in that, with special hashtags or profile flags to show solidarity. By showing this process of grieving, the news media helps communities recover from the trauma.��
Published last September by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School in New York, the report�셲 author, Charlie Beckett, a professor at the London School of Economics, notes the importance of media treating terrorism and the emotion it provokes as more than a commodity. �쏦umanizing terror�셲 victims and their communities may be the best counter-extremist measure media can provide.��
The report ends with a claim that in the past might have seemed discordant, but which today chimes: �쏷he case for more intelligent, informed and socially responsible reporting of terror is not just a moral plea. It is a chance to show journalism remains a vital part of modern society.��
Grey jeans, black trainers and a surface-to-air missile were all that could be seen of the man waiting under a tree for an Egyptian military helicopter to fly past in early January 2014. He fired and the aircraft tumbled to the ground, a moment captured on video by the group that would become Isis Sinai Province, and released in triumph soon after.
The attack served notice to the Egyptian military and the rest of the world that Sinai�셲 Islamist insurgents had stepped up their ambitions and their capacities, drawing weapons and inspiration from the region�셲 other spiralling conflicts. If last week�셲 explosion on board a Russian Metrojet flight from Sharm el-Sheikh proves also to have been their work, those ambitions have reached a new level.
Cairo has long struggled to control the sparsely populated expanses of the Sinai Peninsula, where Islamists have found refuge with smugglers, criminals and others keen to escape too much official scrutiny. But until little over a decade ago, it was a place militants went to hide, train and plot, not somewhere they carried out attacks.
A shift in ideology, the fallout from a government crackdown, and chaos in neighbouring states have transformed the area from dangerous haven to conflict zone. Factions have united into a group with unprecedented access to funds and weapons, and which has become the most ambitious Isis franchise outside Syria or Iraq.
This is the group that claimed responsibility for downing Metrojet flight 9268 last Saturday, after it came down over the Sinai Peninsula with the loss of all lives on board. If it is confirmed that explosives were smuggled on board, it would be the first time since 2004 that a bomb has been used to down a jet. The last such attack was twin suicide bombings in 2004, also on Russian planes.
�쏷here is only one umbrella group, Wilayat Sinaa [Sinai Province]. It simply brought together every militant jihadist in Sinai and from across Egypt,�� said Mohannad Sabry, author of the newly published Sinai: Egypt�셲 Linchpin, Gaza�셲 Lifeline, Israel�셲 Nightmare. �쏷hey all dissolved within the greater umbrella of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which began operating in 2011 and pledged allegiance to Isis in 2014 to become recognised as the strongest branch of Islamic State outside of Syria and Iraq.��
Membership has never been over 500 or 600, he said. �쏷he highly sophisticated militarist elements do not exceed a few dozen members and are highly protected, the rest of the group are simply foot soldiers which the group sends to the frontline of its operations,�� Sabry said.
The group�셲 relatively small size belies its impact. A string of complex and deadly attacks on almost every possible target in the region �� from government forces, international military observers and economic interests to a tourist bus �� grabbed national and international attention. Suicide bombings of army checkpoints last October and in January and July this year that killed dozens of people were the bloodiest peacetime attacks on the country�셲 military.
The last one paved the way for the group to hold a small parcel of territory for the first time, cementing its allegiance to Isis ideology of governing as well as fighting.
The 2014 downing of the military helicopter announced the group�셲 possession of advanced missiles, probably smuggled from Libya in the chaos that followed the collapse of Muammar Gaddafi�셲 regime, and intention to target aircraft.
While man-portable air-defence systems (MPADs) cannot hit passenger jets at cruising altitude �� ruling out a missile strike on the Metrojet plane �� they are a real threat to any plane landing or taking off within range, which could include the Sharm el-Sheikh airport.
Last year Sinai Province also signalled an expansion of its war from the northern heartlands of the insurgency to the tourist resorts of the south, with a bus bombing that killed three Korean Christians and their driver. Beyond Sinai, cells in mainland Egypt bombed police headquarters in Cairo and Mansoura, and tried to assassinate the interior minister.
The deadly swath the group has cut through the area, and the brutal response of the Egyptian military, has brought some of Sinai�셲 problems to the attention of a wider audience. Its current crisis is rooted in part in unforgiving geography, its critical location at the heart of a troubled region. Captured by Israel in the six-day war of 1967, it was held by the country until the Camp David Accords paved the way for its return to Egypt.
Hosni Mubarak presided over that transfer during the 1980s, and the growth of Sharm el-Sheikh as an international tourist resort and holiday destination for members of the Cairo elite, who accumulated villas along its beaches.
Perhaps because of limits on the Egyptian military presence �� under a deal monitored by international observers who still patrol the region �� he did little to make its people feel part of the country, or give them any economic stake in its success.
For decades their struggles with economic marginalisation and political repression were muffled by a virtual blackout on reporting from the region, or drowned out by heavy promotion of the sunshine and beaches of the southern coastal resorts.
The traditional Bedouin inhabitants of the area have perhaps the longest list of grievances against the government, evicted from traditional lands to make way for government-backed settlers, excluded from deals to exploit natural resources like oil and gas, out-numbered in their old homes.
There are no firm statistics available, but with the growth of tourism and other industries, they now make up less than half and perhaps even under a quarter of its half-million official residents, according to regional security expert Zack Gold.
Traditional trade networks became smuggling routes, in part because of lack of other opportunities, driving a further wedge between the government and the Bedouin. In the 2011 revolution, they were among the first to rise up, and the fiercest fighters against the government.
While mistrust of authority and well-protected smuggling routes made Sinai a welcoming base for those targeting Cairo, ensuring them some sympathy and local recruits, the Islamists in Sinai were never fighting a Bedouin revolt. �쏷ribal leaders do not encourage violent extremism and, indeed, the current Islamist insurgency challenges the Bedouin tribal structure and wellbeing,�� Gold said.
Particularly since joining Isis, Sinai Province fighters have stirred up resentment with heavy-handed attempts to control the local population. They have killed dozens as alleged spies, threatened tribal leaders who they believe oppose them, and tried to stop smuggling of cigarettes and marijuana because both are condemned as vices in their hardline interpretation of Islam.
These attacks, and the indirect economic impact of attacks on both tourists and international military observers, the two main employers in the area, are eroding any residual sympathies residents might have for a group fighting the loathed government.
�쏷he Bedouin community has called on the Egyptian regime since 2011 to begin incorporating them in serious action against the militancy. Their calls were ignored,�� Sabry said. �쏯umbers-wise, if the Bedouin community is leading an insurgency or backing the militants, this group would have thousands of fighters within its ranks �� this hasn�셳 happened so far.��
The Bedouin played inadvertent godfathers to the current insurgency through their smuggling tunnels to Gaza, though, linking Palestinian militants who crossed the border looking for freedom or refuge to Egyptian radicals hiding out in the area who they would later fund and train.
�쏧n the 1980s and 1990s, fighting was primarily in Cairo and Upper Egypt. Individuals would go to Sinai to train but not have much to do in terms of carrying out attacks,�� Gold said. That changed when a terror group that would eventually provide members and inspiration for Sinai Province introduced suicide bombings to Sinai in 2004, launching the peninsula�셲 own battle with Islamic militants.
Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Jihad, a group that shared its ideology and name with an early incarnation of al-Qaida in Iraq, launched its first suicide attack on the resort town of Taba, killing over 30 people. Another 88 died in car bombings in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005, and the year after that dozens more were killed when Dahab was hit.
�쏷awhid wal-Jihad focused its attacks on the tourist industry,�� said Gold. �쏷here were of course some battles here and there with security forces ... but what they are known for is the massive bombings at tourist resorts from 2004 to 2006.��
With the vital tourism industry at risk from the string of regular, deadly attacks, the government cracked down hard. The group�셲 leaders were killed in police shootouts, and roundups sent many members to jail. The punitive, wide-ranging nature of the crackdown meant it swept up many ordinary people from the region, turning them against the government.
Resentment of security forces mingled with the memory of the group�셲 impact through its bombings, so that even as it faded as a real threat, it came to serve as inspiration for a new generation of militants.
�쏷he former members of Tawhid wal-Jihad who led the attacks on Taba and Sharm in 2004 and 2005 also joined the ranks of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis since its early days,�� Sabry said. �쏰ne of them was the most lethal mastermind of ABM, Tawfiq Mohammed Freij.��
Freij masterminded and personally commanded a cross-border attack on Israel in August 2011 in which eight Israelis were killed. The incident also stirred up major diplomatic tensions, because Israeli forces chased fighters back across the border and killed three Egyptian policemen in the pursuit. Freij was reported to have been killed by one of his own bombs last year.
The group�셲 initial focus on Israel was reflected in its original name, which translated means �쏶upporters of Jerusalem��. Founders were probably trained in a Gazan militant camp, and leaders appear to have contacts across the border.
Affiliation to Isis came after one of the commanders spent several months in Raqqa last year. It brought extra funds and weapons �� reporting restrictions on the peninsula make it hard to assess how much �� but also shifted the group�셲 priorities, Gold said.
Its new international focus, determination to rule, and disregard for the local population could offer Cairo an opportunity to stamp out the insurgency by finding allies among the people of Sinai. To do that, though, it would need to drop punitive policies, like the mass destruction of civilian homes after Isis attacks, and increase economic and other opportunities for the people of Sinai.
For now, Cairo is still pursuing control at any cost, rooting out militants with harsh reprisals and indiscriminate military operations that risk creating a new generation of insurgents. �쏣ven if the government succeeds in putting an end to the attacks, it will never succeed in putting an end to the radical, extreme and revenge-seeking resentment,�� Sabry said. �쏧t is a seed that eventually, in many cases, grows into an armed terrorist or militant organisation.��
1967 Israel captures control of Sinai from Egypt in the six-day war.
1973 The Yom Kippur war. Egypt recaptures part of the east bank of the Suez canal, a zone stretching a couple of kilometres into Sinai.
1978 The Camp David Accords lay the grounds for a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, and the eventual withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the peninsula, along with Israeli settlers.
1982 Israel withdraws from most of Sinai, and lightly armed troops from 12 countries deploy to monitor the terms of the treaty with Israel as the Multinational Force and Observers. The treaty has been formally violated by an increased Egyptian military deployment in recent years to tackle the growing strength of militant groups, but Israel is also worried about the rise in violence and supports these stepped-up efforts.
1989 Israel hands over the small border town of Taba, the last place it controls in Sinai, to Egypt. In the decade that follows, militants will criss-cross the border with Gaza, but see Sinai as a place to retreat and train, not a target zone for attacks.
2004 Tawhid wal Jihad (Monotheism and Jihad) launches a new era of insurgency inside Sinai when a fighter drives a truck bomb into the Hilton in Taba, killing over 30 people, most of them Israelis.
2005 The same group kills 88 people in car bombings in Sharm el-Sheikh, then more than 30 in an attack on another resort in 2006. The threat to the vital tourist industry prompts a heavy response from the Egyptian government, and much of the group�셲 leadership is wiped out. Many members are jailed, others go underground.
2011 Revolution sweeps through Egypt, including Sinai where a teenager launches the local uprising by firing on the hated security force headquarters. President Hosni Mubarak is ousted, but in the turmoil that follows, a new militant group takes shape in Sinai.
2014 Ansar Beit al-Maqdis shoots down a military helicopter with a Manpad missile probably acquired from Libya. A suicide bomber from the group targets a bus of Korean tourists, killing three and their driver, and an attack on an army checkpoint kills over 30. In October the group announces that it has pledged allegiance to Isis, and changes its name to Sinai Province.
2015 Two more bloody attacks on army outposts kill dozens, and for the first time the group holds a small piece of territory.
October 2015 Metrojet flight comes down over the Sinai peninsula with the loss of all lives. Sinai Province claims responsibility. UK and other countries halt flights to Sharm el-Sheikh over fears a bomb was placed on the plane.
With terror now comes a sinking sense of familiarity. A tragically well-rehearsed routine, in which our particularly British brand of resilience is repeated like a mantra: they will not divide us, we stand together, stronger, our cities are open for business.
But do we actually mean it? The usual hardcore of reactionaries are quick to say that this is a war and we should all be panicking. But I thought the rest of us intended to keep calm and carry on.
As I prepared to accompany my daughter on a school outing to the Tower of London this week, I suddenly realised I�셝 misjudged my fellow parents. So instead of preparing a packed lunch �� no nuts, chocolate or fizzy drinks �� I found myself working out how to introduce the concept of terrorism to my six-year-old child. I�셫 wondering how to do this in a way that leaves her informed but not terrified, and can explain how these people can put her school curriculum on hold. The Tower of London trip has been cancelled. All other trips are under review.
This is not because the school itself thought it unsafe. In a letter to parents, the head said she was �쏿t all times determined not to allow terrorist activity to divert us from the lives we want to live��; to allow that �쐗ould be to grant victory to the extremists��. It was the parents who rebelled. One by one, they decided to withdraw their daughters. There was extra anxiety about a possible attack in the week of the election, but most said their children would not be taking part in any other outings this school year, long after the polling booths had closed.
These parents are not feeling resilient or defiant, they are feeling scared. They may have found themselves tearful at the emotion of the One Love pop concert, screened on TV last weekend. But if they had been in Manchester they would not have let their children go. They are not persuaded by messages of calm �� now notoriously misinterpreted by Donald Trump �� emanating from the mayor of London. They are changing their plans, and doubling down in fear.
This intense period of terror activity just happens to coincide with the term our daughters are studying �쏬ondon landmarks�� as their class topic. It�셲 supposed to be a way of teaching Year 1 pupils about their own relationship to place, history and the city they inhabit. Visiting the Tower of London �� a wildly exciting adventure for that age �� was meant to be the highlight.
I�셫 now �� along with one or two others �� seen as the parent who was willing to go ahead, as if I have a cavalier approach to children�셲 safety. I thought it really was �쐀usiness as usual��. I obviously didn�셳 get the memo that this was something we say, not something we actually believe.
There are rational grounds for my perspective. These recent tragedies �� Westminster, Manchester, London Bridge �� have increased the average number of deaths from terrorism each year to just above the number caused by bees and wasps. But it remains below the number of cyclists killed on the roads, or those drowning in the bathtub. Our children are still far more likely to die from respiratory diseases linked to pollution if they are under four, or from transport accidents if they are aged five to 19, than from anything terror-related.
Indeed, there have been far fewer terror-related deaths in the UK since 2000 than in earlier decades; the 90 people killed on British soil between 2000 and 2015, for example, compares to 1,094 deaths between 1985 and 1999. The preceding 15-year period saw double that number murdered.
I remember that period as a schoolgirl myself. When I was the same age as my daughter is now, the entire school was evacuated while a bomb disposal unit dealt with a package found under the car of a teacher who was married to a Northern Irish judge. I also remember many evenings feeling genuinely scared as to whether my dad would make it home from work, as my mum anxiously relayed news of IRA bombs going off in the city. It�셲 not a tradition I was hoping to pass down through the generations.
But we didn�셳 cancel school outings then, and our parents didn�셳 feel like irresponsible risk-takers. We somehow managed to get on with life, without any massive displays of doing so. Now I�셫 grappling with the opposite �� great and wondrous displays of continuity, yet with a hollow ring.
George Bush was not the only one who saw the September 11 attacks as the start of a war. Just take a look at the newspaper headlines on the following day. In Britain, at least four newspapers used the word "war" on their front pages. War on America in the Daily Telegraph; A Declaration of War in the Guardian; Declaration of War in the Daily Express; and War in the Daily Mirror.
Five days later Tony Blair, the then prime minister, who wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Bush, adopted the same stark rhetoric as he spoke outside Downing Street.
"Whatever the technical or legal issues about a declaration of war, the fact is we are at war with terrorism. It is a war between the civilised world and fanaticism. We have made it clear that we stand side by side with the United States."
So it was Blair �� duly rewarded with the presidential medal of freedom this week �� who adopted the language of war even before Bush.
The US president first used the phrase "war on terror" in an address to a joint session of Congress �� with Blair as one of the dignitaries present �� on 20 September 2001 when he declared: "Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated."
As Gilles Kepel writes in his new book, Beyond Terror and Martyrdom, the war on terror rhetoric was Bush's attempt to weave a grand narrative to drive US foreign policy after 11 September.
The global war on terror (Gwot) �� to give this narrative its full name �� was shortened to the more catchy war on terror. The phrase certainly had a resonance that would appeal to voters �� as it did to the headline writers �� when the administration sought to mobilise public opinion for the coming conflicts: first Afghanistan, then Iraq, where Saddam Hussein was conveniently lumped with al-Qaida, contrary to all evidence.
Bush went on to coin the phrase "axis of evil" (comprising Iran, Iraq and North Korea) in his state of the union message in January 2002 to reinforce his war rhetoric and pave the ground for war in Iraq the following year. Although Iraq �� where no weapons of mass destruction were found �� had nothing to do with the 11 September attacks, that was the beauty of the phrase "war on terror".
As far as the Bush administration was concerned, war on terror covered a multitude of sins and enemies, real or imagined. An elastic term, it was vague and indiscriminate enough to cover anyone the White House considered "against us". But if the term was an effective tool for mobilising Americans, it also created problems. War, or even the rhetoric of war, polarises, hardens sentiments, demonises the enemy and leads to excesses.
The detainee camp set up at Guant찼namo Bay, where the civil liberties of hundreds of suspects went out of the window, extraordinary rendition and the abuses at Abu Ghraib generated anger in the Arab and Muslim world, badly undermining Bush's grand narrative.
If winning hearts and minds is an essential element in prevailing in a conflict, the excesses of the war on terror hurt rather than helped the US, human rights groups warned.
By 2006 Britain's Foreign Office was urging cabinet ministers to drop the talk of war on terror amid concern that it was liable to increase tension in the broadly Muslim world. The Foreign Office said the government wanted to "avoid reinforcing and giving succour to the terrorists' narrative by using language that, taken out of context, could be counter-productive. We tend to emphasise upholding shared values as a means to counter terrorists."
Since coming into office Gordon Brown has eschewed the phrase and, in his speech in Mumbai, David Miliband formally buried the rhetoric. In the US, Hillary Clinton told senators considering her nomination for secretary of state that "diplomacy will be the vanguard of foreign policy" and Barack Obama, like Brown, has avoided the use of the term.
Dropping the war on rhetoric does not mean that the campaign against al-Qaida and al-Qaida-inspired extremists is over by any means. The threat remains, although diminished because so many of al-Qaida's leaders have been killed. In Britain the head of MI5 says the threat of an immediate attack in the UK by al-Qaida-inspired extremists has diminished because of a string of successful prosecutions. But war on terror or not, the US military sees itself in a "long war" with terrorists.
"The struggle may well be fought in dozens of other countries simultaneously and for many years to come," the Pentagon's four-yearly strategy review said in 2006. The review said the US would have to switch the emphasis from large-scale, conventional military operations, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, towards a rapid deployment of highly mobile, often covert, counter-terrorist forces. Just don't call it a war on terror any more.
London or any other part of the UK presents an obvious target for Islamic terrorists, more so than Germany given the UK�셲 high-profile involvement as the closest military ally of the US.
UK intelligence agencies repeatedly warn that it is just a matter of time before a British target is hit. In a rare speech earlier this month, Alex Younger, the head of the UK�셲 overseas intelligence agency MI6, described the threat posed by groups such as Islamic State or its sympathisers as �쐕nprecedented��.
One of the most alarming warnings came last year from Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army officer and chemical weapons expert, who raised the risk of Isis mounting a chlorine attack in the London Underground, similar to the sarin attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.
In spite of such warnings, the UK has seen only one death from Islamic terrorism since the 2005 London bombings that killed 56, including the four perpetrators. The solitary death was Fusilier Lee Rigby, murdered in an al-Qaida-inspired attack in London in 2013. There have been two deaths �� Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham in 2013 and MP Jo Cox this year �� inspired by white supremacism. Republican dissidents have killed soldiers and prison officers in Northern Ireland.
So how has the UK managed to avoid the kind of terror witnessed in France, Belgium and Germany? The UK agencies will seldom engage in such discussions, wary of accusations of complacency and well aware that words spoken today could look foolish if there was to be an attack tomorrow.
But the UK enjoys several advantages. One of the first is that the security services, especially MI5, learned a lot of lessons during the IRA bombing campaigns of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although Italy had to cope for much of this time with its Red Brigades and Germany with the Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof group), the UK faced a much more sustained and relentless bombing campaign. The intelligence agencies and the Royal Ulster Constabulary proved adept at penetrating the IRA, establishing agents �� for money or through blackmail or some other means �� in the highest ranks.
Also, it is harder to acquire guns in the UK compared with continental Europe. The Polish driver of the hijacked truck used in the Berlin attack was shot. The killers in Paris and Brussels were heavily armed. It is riskier for would-be jihadists to try to enter Britain compared with the relative ease of movement on continental Europe.
Perhaps most significant of all is the drastic reorganisation that the police and UK intelligence agencies underwent after the London bombings. Instead of being so London-centric, MI5 officers were dispersed throughout the country: to the Midlands, the north of England, Scotland and Wales. Networks of contacts and informers were established.
In the aftermath of the London bombings, traditional rivalry between the agencies also began to be broken down and today teams from MI5 can be found at the headquarters of MI6 or GCHQ and vice-versa.
All three of the UK intelligence agencies �� MI5, MI6 and GCHQ �� have been expanded and are undergoing further recruitment. MI5 is expanding from 4,000 to 5,000 and MI6 from 2,500 to 3,500.
MI6 hints that it has penetrated Isis, with Younger talking in his speech about taking the fight to the enemy �쐕pstream��.
The most powerful intelligence-gathering organisation in the world is the US�셲 National Security Agency. GCHQ is a junior partner, benefitting from a lot of the data acquired about Isis and other extremist groups.
Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King�셲 College, London, who monitors Isis, sees the US and UK as superior to continental intelligence agencies.
�쏷he US and the UK do it better,�� Maher said. �쏧t is one of the things that keeps us safe in the UK: so far, so good. If you look at disrupted plots here in the UK, it is down to good tradescraft and that does not seem to be happening elsewhere.��
In an interview with the Guardian in October, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the UK security services had stopped 12 terrorist plots since 2013. In 33 years with MI5, Parker said had never seen the tempo as fast as it is now.
The constant fear of the intelligence agencies is they will not stop the next plot. The current threat level in the UK was raised to �쐓evere�� �� one short of the highest �쐁ritical�� �� in 2014. As Parker put in the interview, with no equivocation or caveats: �쏷here will be terrorist attacks in this country.��
A play that asks the audience to decide the guilt or innocence of a morally compromised pilot who shoots down a hijacked passenger plane is coming to the UK after international success.
Ferdinand von Schirach�셲 play Terror has become something of global phenomenon since it opened in Berlin in 2015.
It follows the courtroom drama of an air force pilot, Major Lars Koch, who had been ordered to divert an aeroplane with 164 people on board that had been hijacked by terrorists. When the plane suddenly changes course towards a football stadium with 70,000 people watching the Germany-England game, what should Koch do?
The play has been staged in seven countries as well as on television in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
It is now coming to the UK this summer courtesy of the Lyric Hammersmith theatre in west London.
The Lyric�셲 artistic director, Sean Holmes, said it was less a play about terror and more one that explored clashes of personal and state morality.
�쏻hat I like about the play is its seriousness and its populism. I know that�셲 a dirty word these days, but I mean it in the most positive sense,�� he said. �쏧t is a proper interrogation of the effect that terror has on our lives, in our attitude to the rule of law. But it is really about our personal moral judgment as opposed to what the state might say.
�쏛ll of that seems apt at the moment given where we are politically and people losing faith in political institutions.��
On the face of it, a verdict of not guilty might seem obvious: up to 70,000 deaths in the stadium as opposed to 164 on the plane. But Holmes said there were clever moral and philosophical twists and turns in the play that made it less black and white.
A website for the play charts the number of guilty and not guilty verdicts across the 46 theatres in seven countries that have staged the show. In 1,063 trials, 91.9% of verdicts have been not guilty.
Of the 287,236 jurors who have cast a vote 60.7% voted not guilty. In Japan, two-thirds of jurors found the pilot guilty.
Holmes, who will direct Terror, said he had organised a rehearsed reading of the play last year and the 50 audience members all �쐒eally took notice of what was being said�� and took their responsibilities seriously.
The play, which will have a British cast, is part of a newly announced 2017 season that also features a new adaptation of Chekhov�셲 The Seagull by Simon Stephens, which will star Lesley Sharp.
Terrorist plots on the scale of those carried out in Paris and Brussels have been foiled in Britain in the past four years, Britain�셲 most senior counter-terrorism officer has revealed.
Launching an appeal for public help in combating terrorism, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the thwarted attacks were among 13 plots that had been prevented since the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4�셲 Today programme, Rowley said many of the disrupted attacks involved only one or two individuals. But he added: �쏶ome of them have been more sophisticated planning looking to attack public spaces, or police offices or the military, not that dissimilar to some of the attacks we have seen in Belgium and France and elsewhere. There is a whole range from the simple to the complicated.��
The figure 13 is one higher than the previous tally in October.As part of the Action Counters Terrorism campaign, a podcast has been produced revealing previously untold stories of how UK terrorist attacks were prevented, featuring accounts from detectives, bomb disposal and surveillance officers.
Rowley said the aim of releasing new material was to give an insight into how terrorists might prepare and provide more confidence for the public to report any suspicions.
TV adverts have been launched appealing for members of the public to report any suspicious conversation they might overhear.
Rowley, the National Police Chiefs�� Council lead for counter-terrorism, urged the public to be wary of far-right terrorist plots as well as those from Islamic extremists.He said: �쏶ometimes reporting oversimplifies things and says terrorism is about IS [Islamic State] or Daesh and it�셲 about Syria. Actually there are many Isis offshoots in other parts of world, al-Qaida is still very, very significant.
�쏛nd of course in the UK �� extreme rightwing groups are very provocative and can cause significant risk to our communities, and indeed there are extreme rightwing-related issues which led to the tragic murder of Jo Cox.��
Rowley conceded that such cases were not of the same magnitude as Islamic extremism but denied that bracketing the two forms of terrorism confused the public.
He pointed out that the judge who tried Cox�셲 killer, Thomas Mair, said he had been inspired by an admiration for Nazis.
Rowley also said the threat of terrorism from those inspired by Isis would continue despite the group�셲 military setbacks in Iraq and Syria. �쏷his threat is going to continue in different forms and it going to keep metamorphosing,�� he said.
�쏷he reason for this appeal is to say to the public: �쁔rust your instinct, we are already getting lots of information on a third of our cases, look at our website, listen to these adverts, and if you pick up anything at all suspicious don�셳 be cautious please us.�쇺��
The official threat level for international terrorism has been at severe �� meaning an attack is highly likely �� for more than two years.
Rowley said: �쏻e are likely to face a severe threat for sometime to come. And we need the missing piece in the jigsaw in the investigations we are running that often the public have.��
In the year to March, the anti-terrorist hotline received more than twice the number of calls in the previous 12 months, with 22,000 people making contact.
Australia has long revered the fifth governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, as an enlightened humanitarian who brought civilisation to the colony.
Macquarie is the Australian leader who used terrorism and slaughter to quell hostile Indigenous resistance to invasion and dispossession.
Macquarie is perhaps the most eulogised and memorialised of colonial governors, with a university, many buildings, a bank, a library and countless statues and plaques named in his honour.
Since 2013 a statue of Macquarie, born in 1762 in Argyll, Scotland, has stood in Hyde Park, the open space he created in central Sydney for public recreation.
Perhaps the statue should be paired with a monument to remember warriors Kanabygal and Durelle, who were among the Aboriginal men, women and children Macquarie ordered murdered at Appin in the NSW highlands 200 years ago this month.
The massacre was a culmination of colonial violence that began with raids by the local Dharawal people on the crops and livestock of the �쐓ettlers�� who had taken their land. Reprisal attacks from farmers and militias followed. Many men, women and children, black and white, died.
Macquarie�셲 men, accompanied by Aboriginal trackers, shot and hung the two Dharawal men and one woman in trees to terrorise the other Indigenous people, before hacking off their heads as trophies that ended up at Edinburgh University.
Since repatriation from Scotland in 1991, the heads have been stored in the National Museum of Australia�셲 Canberra repatriation unit, with the remains, at times, of some 700 other Indigenous people whose bodies were stolen and which can�셳, for various reasons, be returned to country.
There is continuing dispute between local Indigenous groups around Appin about custodianship of the remains of Kanabygal, Durelle and the woman.
I have stood before these boxes of bones. And then I�셶e gone down to the isolated crevices along the banks of the Cataract river near Appin where Macquarie�셲 soldiers opened fire, forcing many to fall to their deaths over the 60-metre high cliffs.
Down there I�셶e wandered around pondering Macquarie�셲 instructions: �쏰n any occasion of seeing or falling in with the Natives, either in Bodies or Singly, they are to be called upon, by your friendly Native Guides, to surrender themselves to you as Prisoners of War. If they refuse to do so, make the least show of resistance, or attempt to run away from you, you will fire upon and compel them to surrender, breaking and destroying the Spears, Clubs and Waddies of all those you take Prisoners. Such natives as happen to be killed on such occasions, if grown up men, are to be hanged up on Trees in Conspicuous Situations, to Strike the Survivors with the greater terror.��
Macquarie recommended women and children be spared where possible. But they weren�셳.
A Captain Wallis who oversaw the murders recounted: �쏧 formed line ranks, entered and pushed on through a thick brush towards the precipitous banks of a deep rocky creek, the dogs gave the alarm and the natives fled over the cliffs. A smart firing now ensued �� it was moonlight the grey dawn of morn appearing, so dark as to be only to discover their figures bounding from rock to rock.
�쏧 had ordered my men to take as many prisoners as possible and to be careful in sparing and saving the women and children ... I regret to say some had been shot and others met their fate by rushing in despair over the precipice.
�쏷was a melancholy but necessary duty I was employed upon. Fourteen dead bodies were counted in different directions ... I detached Lieut Parker with the bodies of Durelle and Kumnabaygal to be hanged on a conspicuous part of a range of hills.��
A humble monument stands close to the massacre site �� something of a counter, really, to Macquarie�셲 proud statue in Hyde Park.
Every 17 April for 20 years there�셲 been a commemoration at this memorial, which reads: �쏷he massacre of men, women and children of the Dharawal Nation occurred near here on 17th April, 1816 ... We acknowledge the impact this had and continues to have on the Aboriginal people of this land. We are deeply sorry. We will remember them.��
But who will remember that Macquarie, the man considered by so many to be Australia�셲 renaissance governor �� an aesthete who increased crop and livestock production, brought schools, hospitals and banks to the colony �� was also, by his own word, a terrorist?
It�셲 been skated around, white-inked away.
Take the Australian Dictionary of Biography. His policy concerning the blackfellas was, it says, �쏿n expression of the same humanitarian conscience�� he brought to other colonial matters.
�쏰rders of merit and even an old general�셲 uniform were bestowed on deserving chiefs. The results of this naive policy were not very encouraging and, in 1816, when the natives showed signs of ungrateful hostility, he organised a military drive to chasten them. But no other governor since Phillip had shown them so much sympathy.��
Such humanitarian conscience doesn�셳 extend to his so-called �쏯ative Institution�� at Parramatta, where forcibly removed Indigenous children were kept so they might be �쐁ivilised��.
There are many chilling postscripts to Macquarie�셲 act of murder and terrorism at Appin 200 years ago. Child abduction is but one.
In written orders to a Captain Schaw, the governor commanded: �쏶elect and secure that number [12 Aboriginal boys and six girls, aged between four and six] of fine healthy good-looking children from the whole of the Native Prisoners of war taken in the course of your operations and direct them to be delivered to ... the Native Institution at Parramatta.��
Australia has renamed the landscape to commemorate massacres of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (there are six Slaughterhouse creeks in this continent and eight Skeleton creeks in Queensland alone).
The least we should do is rethink how Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth governor of New South Wales �� and a terrorist �� is remembered.
Seven people have died after a terrorist attack at London Bridge and Borough Market. Here is what we know so far
The problem of �쐆omegrown�� terrorism inspired by Islamic State is front and centre of the counter-terrorism agenda in western Europe. In the UK, the government estimates the terrorist threat to be �쐓evere��. It also estimates that about 850 individuals �쐎f national security concern�� have travelled from the UK to Iraq and Syria since the conflict there began, and about half of them have returned.
But what is the most effective way for governments to respond to this threat, without undermining the very values of democracy and freedom that they claim they want to defend?
In the UK, this debate has focused, particularly over the past year, on the government�셲 Prevent programme �� which seeks to stop individuals being drawn into terrorism. Since 2015, the so-called �쏱revent duty�� has in effect required teachers, doctors and other frontline professionals to report individuals at risk of being drawn into violent and non-violent extremism to the police-led �쏞hannel�� support programme. Is this the correct and proportional response?
A report released today by the Open Society Justice Initiative, Eroding Trust: The UK�셲 �쏱revent�� Counter-Extremism Strategy in Health and Education says that it is not. Based on legal analysis, case studies and numerous interviews, we argue that Prevent is not only unjust but also unproductive.
Prevent�셲 overly broad definition of extremism �� vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values �� creates a systemic risk of violations of the right to freedom of expression, the right against discrimination and the right to privacy. Scottish government officials told me that although the term �쏝ritish values�� was in the Prevent guidance, they �쐂on�셳 ever use that phrase�� because �쐇t could be damaging or unhelpful if it endorses a �쁳hem and us�� mentality��.
Having spoken to more than 80 experts and individuals affected by the programme, my research found that Prevent was creating a climate of fear and a chilling effect on free expression. Case studies in the report describe children in schools being targeted and intimidated under Prevent for expressing political views. In UK universities �� considered by many to be bastions of academic freedom �� Prevent is apparently leading to the cancellation of conferences and debates about Islamophobia, and students are being targeted for reading course materials on terrorism.
Conversations about terrorism are being driven underground, where they are less likely to be challenged. In healthcare facilities, doctors fear that their obligation to report patients to the authorities is in conflict with their duty of confidentiality and will undermine the doctor-patient relationship. One psychologist quoted in the report says, �쐗e are being encouraged to police thought crimes and political opinions�� and describes another psychologist being fed questions by Prevent officers to ask her patient.
For these reasons, we are calling for the repeal of the Prevent duty in health and education so that frontline professionals can be free to get on with their jobs and apply their professional judgment to respond appropriately to cases that genuinely warrant intervention.
A particularly troubling case study in the report describes an organisation collecting names and sensitive political information for the Home Office �� apparently under Prevent, and apparently without informed consent �� from nine- and 10-year-old children from a predominantly Muslim area. A questionnaire distributed to the children to elicit their opinions is included in the report.
It asked whether they agreed or disagreed with statements such as: �쏧 think most people respect my race or religion��; �쏱eople should be free to say what they like, even if it offends others��; �쏱eople from a different race, religion or community are just as good as people like me��; and �쏻omen are just as good as men at work��. It also asked the children how much they trusted people of their race or religion, people of another race or religion, school teachers, police officers, journalists and the UK government. Would these children have been targeted in this manner had they not been predominantly Muslim?
In a climate of intense anti-Muslim sentiment, the report argues, Prevent gives frontline professionals broad discretion to act on their conscious and unconscious biases. The report notes that the government�셲 own figures show that in the past, 80% of referrals to the police-led Channel programme were rejected. Since the statutory �쏱revent duty�� took effect in 2015, the number of referrals to Channel has skyrocketed. The government�셲 annual report on Contest, its counterterrorism strategy, notes that �쐂uring 2015, there were several thousand referrals to Channel; around 15% of these were linked to far-right extremism, and around 70% linked to Islamist-related extremism��; but that of those referred, only �쐓everal hundred�� were provided with support in 2015. This suggests that a significant number of individuals were wrongly referred.
Unsurprisingly, Prevent is alienating many law-abiding Muslims wrongly targeted and causing them to question their place in British society. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, observed in his testimony before parliament�셲 home affairs select committee that �쏱revent has become a more significant source of grievance in affected communities than the police and ministerial powers �� that are exercised under the Pursue strand of the Contest strategy��. Prevent�셲 alienating effect in turn undermines the ability of law enforcement officials to elicit the cooperation of Muslim communities for countering future terrorist attacks.
There are parallels here with another policing issue affecting minority communities: the disproportionate use of stop and search. In 2014, Theresa May, then home secretary, told parliament: �쏯obody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.�� Surely the prime minister�셲 words are also true for Prevent when it is misapplied to Muslims?
A British teenager, thought to be the UK�셲 youngest convicted terrorist, has been sentenced to life, with at least five years detention, for plotting an Anzac Day �쐌assacre�� in Australia when he was just 14.
Sentencing, Mr Justice Saunders said it was chilling that a defendant so young had been �쐆oping and intending that the outcome would be the deaths of a number of people��.
The boy, from Blackburn, Lancashire, was the organiser and adviser of a plot to behead Australian police officers on Anzac Day.
The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Manchester crown court in July to inciting terrorism overseas. It emerged during the trial that the teenager sent thousands of online messages to contacts in Australia.
The judge said the defendant would not be released until he was considered not to be dangerous. �쏷hanks to the intervention of the police in this country and in Australia, that attack and the deaths which were intended to follow never happened,�� he said.
�쏦ad the authorities not intervened, [the defendant] would have continued to play his part hoping and intending that the outcome would be the deaths of a number of people.
�쏧n March 2015 he would have been pleased if that had happened. He would have welcomed the notoriety that he would have achieved.
�쏷he revelation in this case that someone of only 14 could have become so radicalised that he was prepared to carry out this role intending and wishing that people should die is chilling.��
The teenager hugged his parents and family members after sentence was passed down before he was led from the courtroom.
Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said he found it �쐓ad and shocking�� that such a young boy could be radicalised to the point where he incited a terror attack.
�쏧t is a warning to teenagers. The seduction of this Isil message ... it can be very compelling. Once you get into the internet I have a theory that you can almost self-radicalise because what you will do you will go deeper and deeper,�� he said
Parents should attempt to understand the �쐎nline footprints�� of their children, such the websites, apps and conversations they were engaging in, he said. �쏧s your kid up at three o�셛lock in the morning on social media? I think you have got some questions as a parent if you find that is happening.��
He added: �쏧 encourage parents to be quite nosy with their children. It is difficult but you need to engage with your kids, especially if you have got concerns. And you might need help. You might not be able to solve it yourself and there is help out there. What we don�셳 want is to be getting into the space we are in here.�쒪t the sentencing hearing on Thursday, the court heard that the defendant was radicalised by an online jihadi community, accessed via his first smartphone, which prosecutors said had filled a void caused by problems at school and at home, as well as a degenerative eye condition.
He became a celebrity of the online jihadi community, operating 89 Twitter accounts and attracting 24,000 followers within a fortnight.
Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the court it was �쏿 plot that would in all probability have resulted in a number of deaths.��
The teenager was arrested on 25 March after concerns were raised by his school about his extreme behaviour, where classmates had nicknamed him �쐔he terrorist��.
Mr Justice Saunders said the day of the planned attack was chosen because of �쐇ts importance to Australia and its people�� when those who have died in conflict are honoured. He said: �쏧t was the day when the killings would have the greatest impact. The victims were to be police officers who were to be killed either with a car or by being beheaded.��
The judge said a considerable amount of expertise had gone into explaining how and why the teenager became so radicalised. �쏧t appears he felt isolated in terms of his education and home life. There was a vacuum in his life which he filled with religious extremism.��
The judge described how the teenager�셲 behaviour had changed gradually over three years, but most markedly in 2014 when he had begun accessing extreme material.
�쏦e communicated with extremist propagandists who either worked for Isis or supported their aims over the internet,�� Mr Justice Saunders said. �쏷hey were experienced recruiters who were keen to enlist young impressionable Muslims to the cause.��
Those who groomed the defendant had succeeded in �쐔urning him into a deeply committed radical extremist,�� the judge continued.
Lessons could be learned from the way the teenager paid lip service to de-radicalisation programmes like Channel, the judge concluded. �쏝ut there is no material before me from which blame should be attributed to anyone, except those extremists who were prepared to use the internet to encourage extreme views in a boy of 14 and then use him to carry out terrorist acts.��
The defendant was said to have made considerable progress at the detention centre where he is being held but the author of the teenager�셲 pre-sentence report concluded he still presents a high risk of serious harm to the public.
�쏧 acknowledge the progress and encourage the work done by [the defendant] and others but I have no doubt a significant risk remains,�� the judge said, adding that there was no certainty on how long de-radicalisation would take.
�쏧 very much hope that the risk will have been removed in five years and he can be released and realise his considerable potential in society,�� he concluded.
More than 200 armed police have practised their response to a terrorist attack on a Thames �쐏leasure boat�� in the first drill of its kind on London�셲 main river.
A sightseeing ship became the scene of a fierce mock gun battle between armed officers and police posing as terrorists shortly after 11am on Sunday.
The exercise, close to the London Docklands area, marks the first time the Metropolitan police have staged a live, waterborne exercise like this.
Armed officers boarded the ship in a hail of gunfire just over two hours after five officers posing as armed terrorists hijacked the vessel. At least one �쐀ody��, played by a volunteer, was thrown overboard.
The Met, the Port of London Authority, London Coastguard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), London ambulance service and London fire brigade took part in the exercise aimed at testing the effectiveness of emergency rescue tactics in lifelike conditions. The drill was designed to test every phase of the emergency response �� from the moment an incident is reported to the conclusion of a rescue operation.
Commander BJ Harrington, head of the Met�셲 public order command, said the exercise was not in response to any specific intelligence about an impending marine attack. But he noted that recent terrorist incidents in the rest of Europe showed how would-be attackers have found varied ways to inflict harm.
He said: �쏧t�셲 important to point out that the exercise has not been designed in response to any specific threat. There�셲 no information that we have that we�셱e preparing for.
�쏰f course, we have seen a number of incidents abroad in the past few years: Nice, Berlin �� we have seen different methodologies developing, and, of course, the river runs right through London, so why wouldn�셳 we prepare for that.��
The exercise comes just two weeks after the Met�셲 most senior counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, revealed that security services have thwarted 13 potential terrorist attacks in the UK in less than four years.
The official threat level for international terrorism in the UK has been at severe �� meaning an attack is highly likely �� for more than two years.
Harrington said the exercise was the first time all the involved agencies had come together to test their response to an attack and hoped it would act as a deterrent to any would-be assailants.
He said: �쏮ost importantly, we give the people who are going to have to do this tricky and difficult and dangerous stuff the opportunity to have confidence that they can do it, and hopefully, above all, give confidence to people who live and work and visit London to say the police, the agencies, blue light agencies and other public service agencies, are in a really good position to protect them and keep them safe.��
The operation, code-named Anchor, came 24 hours after French police shot dead a gunman at a Paris airport.
In June 2015, Operation Strong Tower saw hundreds of officers respond to a simulated terror threat in a disused London tube station. This was just five days after a gunman killed 30 Britons on a beach in Tunisia.
On Sunday, Harrington praised the courage of service personnel who deal with terrorist situations. He said: �쏧 just want to stress the bravery of the people involved in this. They go forward to face what is a deadly attack �� they have no concern for their own lives. It fills me with confidence that these people are prepared to do this kind of thing.��
The terrorist attacks in Mumbai seven weeks ago sent shock waves around the world. Now all eyes are fixed on the Middle East, where Israel's response to Hamas's rockets, a ferocious military campaign, has already left a thousand Gazans dead.
Seven years on from 9/11 it is clear that we need to take a fundamental look at our efforts to prevent extremism and its terrible offspring, terrorist violence. Since 9/11, the notion of a "war on terror" has defined the terrain. The phrase had some merit: it captured the gravity of the threats, the need for solidarity, and the need to respond urgently - where necessary, with force. But ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken. The issue is not whether we need to attack the use of terror at its roots, with all the tools available. We must. The question is how.
The idea of a "war on terror" gave the impression of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. The reality is that the motivations and identities of terrorist groups are disparate. Lashkar-e-Taiba has roots in Pakistan and says its cause is Kashmir. Hezbollah says it stands for resistance to occupation of the Golan Heights. The Shia and Sunni insurgent groups in Iraq have myriad demands. They are as diverse as the 1970s European movements of the IRA, Baader-Meinhof, and Eta. All used terrorism and sometimes they supported each other, but their causes were not unified and their cooperation was opportunistic. So it is today.
The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists, or good and evil, the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common. Terrorist groups need to be tackled at root, interdicting flows of weapons and finance, exposing the shallowness of their claims, channelling their followers into democratic politics.
The "war on terror" also implied that the correct response was primarily military. But as General Petraeus said to me and others in Iraq, the coalition there could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife.
This is what divides supporters and opponents of the military action in Gaza. Similar issues are raised by the debate about the response to the Mumbai attacks. Those who were responsible must be brought to justice and the government of Pakistan must take urgent and effective action to break up terror networks on its soil. But on my visit to south Asia this week, I am arguing that the best antidote to the terrorist threat in the long term is cooperation. Although I understand the current difficulties, resolution of the dispute over Kashmir would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms, and allow Pakistani authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders.
We must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it, for it is the cornerstone of the democratic society. We must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties at home and abroad. That is surely the lesson of Guant찼namo and it is why we welcome President-elect Obama's commitment to close it.
The call for a "war on terror" was a call to arms, an attempt to build solidarity for a fight against a single shared enemy. But the foundation for solidarity between peoples and nations should be based not on who we are against, but on the idea of who we are and the values we share. Terrorists succeed when they render countries fearful and vindictive; when they sow division and animosity; when they force countries to respond with violence and repression. The best response is to refuse to be cowed.

The plan, which the French DGSE foreign intelligence service became aware of earlier this year, is revealed in a secret report to the French government on threat levels. The report, dated December 19, indicates that the tip-off came from the American CIA. British and French intelligence agencies have run a series of checks of the security system protecting the 31-mile tunnel but the threat level, the DGSE warns, remains high. British security services remain on high alert throughout the holiday period.
According to the French sources, the plan was put together in Pakistan and is being directed from there. The plotters are believed to be Western Europeans, possibly Britons of Pakistani descent. The DGSE say that levels of 'chatter', the constant communication that takes place between militants, has not been so high since 2001. Last week Sir Ian Blair, the head of the Metropolitan Police, described 'the threat of another terrorist attempt' as 'ever present' adding that 'Christmas is a period when that might happen'.
'It is a far graver threat in terms of civilians than either the Cold War or the Second World War,' he said. 'It's a much graver threat than that posed by Irish Republican terrorism.'
American security sources told The Observer that the threat was 'sky high'.
The news of the threat to the Channel Tunnel comes as Eurostar trains transport record numbers of passengers heading home for Christmas and as fog continues to affect flights to and from the continent.
More than 8 million passengers travelled on Eurostar trains last year. Staff on the line went on strike earlier this year in protest at what they said were lax security arrangements.
'A successful attack on such an installation would be almost as spectacular as September 11', said one terrorist expert. 'Al-Qaeda and those they inspire are trying everything from low-level strikes to major attacks on critical infrastructure.'
The DGSE report also mentions an al-Qaeda project for a 'wave of attacks in an unidentified European country planned and run from Syria and Iraq'. The period of highest risk is said to be from September 2006 to April 2007.
The detail in which the attacks have been planned in Pakistan will worry British counter-terrorist services. The UK is in a particularly vulnerable position as a result of its close alliance with America, its physical accessibility compared with the US, and its large Muslim minority, many of whom have links with Pakistan.
Osama bin Laden and other key senior al-Qaeda leaders are thought to be based in the tribal territories along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There is believed to be a steady stream of British militants making their way to the newly reconstituted al-Qaeda bases in the region. More than 400,000 British citizens travel to Pakistan every year. Though the vast majority are visiting family or friends, some have exploited the ease of travel for darker reasons: at least two of the 7/7 bombers spent time in the south-west Asian state.
Last week news reports in America detailed a squad of a dozen English-speaking militants, nine of whom are said to be British who, having sought out the al-Qaeda bases, have now been trained to a high level in terrorist tactics. The group is known as the English Brothers because of their shared language. Apart from the nine Britons, the squad is made up of an Australian and two Norwegians. It was reported that Bin Laden and other militant leaders hope they will lead a new wave of terror attacks on the continent.
Eliza Manningham-Buller, director-general of MI5, recently disclosed that UK intelligence services are monitoring more than 200 networks and 1,600 individuals in Britain. She said that her investigators had identified nearly 30 plots 'that often have links back to al-Qaeda in Pakistan, and through those links al-Qaeda gives guidance and training to its largely British foot soldiers here'.
In the early 90s, I went from Lahore to Delhi to attend a wedding in the family of some Hindu friends. At one of its many events, I bumped into a friend from Lahore who was also visiting the city. We were chatting in Punjabi when we noticed a well-dressed, middle-aged man lurking nearby, apparently eavesdropping on our conversation. Noticing our discomfiture, he apologised.
�쏻hen you mentioned Lahore, I couldn�셳 tear myself away,�� he said. �쏽ou see, we are Hindus, but my family was Lahori. We had a house in Model Town and I attended Aitchison college. We left at partition. I have never gone back. When my wife passed away, 17 years ago, I thought that even though I had no children or siblings I would get by. But now I feel the creeping loneliness of old age and what I think of most is the happiness of my childhood. I have a yearning to return to Lahore. I want to see it once before I die.��
Everywhere I went in Delhi I heard similar stories, but that is not surprising. At partition, Delhi received a huge influx of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Punjab. Some moved on to other parts of India, but most stayed and put down roots. In the 90s, many of those elderly migrants were alive; whenever I bumped into them and they heard I was from Lahore, they crowded round, asking me to speak in �쐒eal Lahori Punjabi��. Others asked after childhood haunts they hadn�셳 seen for almost 50 years �� Anarkali Bazaar, Shalimar Gardens, Mayo School of Arts, Model Town. �쏰ur home was on Queen�셲 Road. It had a semicircular driveway and black, wrought-iron balconies. Is it still there?�� �쏡o the fireflies still dance on the canal on summer nights?�� �쏡o you ever go to Faletti�셲 hotel? And its famous cabarets?�� When I told the late writer and historian Khushwant Singh �� a Delhi wallah who was once a Lahori �� of my encounters in Delhi, he smiled and said: �쏽ou should see them at the cinema. Whenever Lahore gets mentioned, they all burst into tears together.��
Seventy years ago, on 14 August 1947, as 200 years of British rule came to an end, India was divided into two independent states, Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India. It was one of the most painful births in modern history. More than 12 million people were displaced as Muslims in Punjab and Bengal fled across the hastily drawn borders into Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs made the opposite journey into India. In the sectarian violence that ensued, 2 million people were killed, tens of thousands of women were raped and abducted, homes were plundered and villages were torched.
My father, who was then at Aitchison college, an elite boarding school, remembers being summoned by the English headmaster to an extraordinary assembly in April 1947. School usually broke up for summer holidays in the first week of June, but the headmaster announced that, this year, term would end sooner �� in fact, the school would close the following day. �쏱artition was expected in 1948, but the date had been brought forward and riots had already erupted in parts of the North-West Frontier province and some areas of Punjab,�� recalls my father. �쏶ince he could not guarantee our safety, our headmaster had decided to send us home.�� My father took what he thought was temporary leave of his many Hindu and Sikh friends and left for Shergarh, his village in Okara district, 70 miles south-west of Lahore.
Luckily, the line that was drawn two months later, severing Punjab in two, allotted Shergarh to Pakistan. My Muslim father had the great fortune of not having to flee his ancestral home. Nonetheless, three months of pure terror followed. �쏧 have never known a period of greater fear and uncertainty,�� he says. Shergarh was surrounded by Sikh villages. Once killings began, the villagers braced themselves for an attack every day. �쏻ild bands of marauding men armed with sickles, axes and swords roamed the open countryside, killing and mutilating anyone they found of the opposite faith.��
Yet my father�셲 grandfather had been on good terms with his Sikh and Hindu neighbours. This closeness was not unusual in pre-partition Punjab. �쏷here was no intermarriage between the communities and we tended not to eat at each other�셲 houses, but we were fast friends,�� recalls my mother�셲 brother, Syed Babar Ali, now 91.
When my father returned to school in September, he was one of only 30 of the 300 boys who had left in April. The rest, Hindus and Sikhs, had gone. The school had also lost many of its staff. �쏷here were more cows in the school dairy than boys in the classroom,�� he remembers. �쏛itchison was a haunted place.��
True, political tension had been rising inexorably in the two decades preceding partition, as leaders of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League bickered over the terms of the bitter divorce. But the suddenness, scale and ferocity of the violence that erupted in 1947 was still shocking. As historians and writers such as Nisid Hajary and Saadat Hassan Manto have noted, it was a time when the normal mores of civilisation were suspended and neighbours massacred each other without a thought.
The figures speak for themselves, but it was the barbarity that was unleashed that was terrifying. Trains filled with refugees crossing the border were stopped and every man, woman and child on board slaughtered. Only the engine driver was spared, so he could take his grisly cargo to its destination. Women �� some as young as 10 �� were captured and raped, and pregnant women�셲 bellies were slit open. Babies were swung against walls and their heads smashed in. My great aunt, then a married woman living in the walled city of Lahore, told me she had seen a man crossing an eerily quiet street littered with corpses. He was halfway across when someone shot at him. Scooping up the body of a toddler, he used it as a protective shield as he raced across. �쏧 don�셳 know if that man was Muslim or Hindu,�� she told me 30 years later. �쏧t was dreadful either way.��
Partition, as Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal has observed, was �쐔he central historical event in 20th-century south Asia��. It scarred those who lived through it and permanently soured relations between the two countries. �쏧t is impossible to understand relations between India and Pakistan without looking back to partition,�� says Alex von Tunzelmann, a historian and the author of Indian Summer, a history of partition. �쏷he wounds have never healed.��
Here, five people share their stories of living through partition.
I was born in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, the eldest of six children. We are Punjabi Muslims, but we lived in Jammu because my father was the director of education there. Unlike the neighbouring city of Srinagar, which was predominantly Muslim, Jammu was about three-quarters Hindu and an important centre of the rightwing Hindu party, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. But our neighbourhood in the south was Muslim. My two sisters and I attended a school in the north, about two miles from our house. In between lay the Hindu-dominated area of town. Communal riots were frequent and whenever disorder erupted my mother would make us skip school for a couple of days. If the situation got bad, curfew would be imposed and the Maharaja�셲 troops were called until order was restored.
By May, riots had begun in some districts of Punjab. There was also growing unease in Jammu, but, accustomed as we were to such disruptions, we thought it was more of the same. Srinagar was peaceful, so we moved in with an aunt and uncle who lived there, planning to return home as soon as things calmed down.
At partition, there was doubt as to which country the state of Jammu would join. It had a Muslim majority, but its ruler, Hari Singh, was a Hindu. By mid-August, the rest of India had already been partitioned, but our fates still hung in the balance. As the month wore on, Hindu and Sikh refugees limped into Srinagar, narrating stories of the bloodshed they had escaped in the Punjab. It was not long before riots broke out all over Jammu.
In September, my parents, along with two other Muslim families, decided to move temporarily to Pakistan for safety. A truck set off from Rawalpindi to collect us. On the eve of our departure, my father decided he would stay on. As a civil servant, he felt duty-bound to return to Jammu, since he did not have official permission to leave his post. He assured my mother he would apply for leave and join us immediately.
On 28 September, we boarded the truck with two suitcases and two rolls of bedding each and left for Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, along the Jhelum River road �� a beautiful drive in any other circumstances. My father reported for duty in Jammu city on 5 October. In Pakistan, my mother managed to make contact with my father�셲 younger brother, an accountant who was stationed at Rasul headworks in northern Punjab, and we went on to him.
On 8 November, we received a relative from Gujranwala, a town in Punjab some distance from Rasul. He told us that, three days before, our father had left Jammu in a convoy of trucks arranged by the state government and escorted by its troops. There were about 1,200 Muslims in the trucks. Dusk was falling when the convoy stopped suddenly beyond the city limits and the troops ordered everyone to disembark. In the gathering darkness, the travellers saw clusters of men emerge from behind trees and form two concentric circles around them. They were armed with staffs, swords and daggers. At a signal from their leader, they rushed at the unarmed civilians, hacking, slashing, smashing. It was, he told us, a scene of unimaginable violence. People ran hither and thither, begging for mercy; mothers tried to shield their children; old people fell silently to their knees; men tried in vain to fight back. Mercifully, because it was dark by then, about one-third succeeded in escaping. The border was just a few miles away and the lucky ones managed to straggle across. Our father was not one of them. �쏮alik Sahib was martyred that evening,�� said our relative, lowering his eyes.
In fact, the news was incorrect: my father had volunteered to leave in the convoy, but he was asked by the authorities to stay back and join one departing the next day.
This time, it was broad daylight and the killers were more organised. They cut down everyone and threw the bodies into a nearby canal. A handful survived �� those they had left for dead or who had jumped into the canal. A friend of my father�셲, Chaudhry Hameedullah, was among the survivors. He said: �쏧 saw Sahib being cut down. But I can�셳 say whether he survived or not.��
Because of this tiny element of doubt, my mother clung on to hope for months.
I returned to Jammu in 1979, accompanied by my wife and my daughter. We still have relatives there. I saw my old house, met my Hindu school friends, visited my school. But I went with only one purpose: to see the place where they killed my father.
I was born in a small village called Chahal Kalan in the district of Gujranwala, Punjab. I still dream about it. Chahal Kalan was surrounded by open fields and lakes to which migratory birds came. You could hear the tinkling bells of the bullocks driving Persian wells. We used dung cakes for fuel. During winter, the smoke from our fires and the mist from the lakes would mingle and enshroud our village.
In my village, we Hindus made up only 5% of the population. The rest were Muslims. But there was absolute harmony. Partition was announced on 15 August. Hindus and Muslims decided jointly that we would guard our village together. Night watch groups were formed. A week later, rumours spread that the village was going to be invaded. So, my parents and other Hindus sent their children to a neighboring Sikh village for safety. At lunchtime, we heard our village had been overrun and a Muslim mob was coming to kill us; we ran away in panic. But by the evening we heard our village hadn�셳 been invaded at all. It had been a hoax.
A few days later, a military chief arrived in a jeep to help us evacuate. But it was a small jeep and ours was a large family, so my father declined the offer. He said: �쏻e trust our neighbours and if we have to become Muslims we will become Muslims, but we will not leave.�� The mullah of the neighbouring mosque sent a message to my father; if he wanted to convert, he would be happy to perform the ceremony. A couple of days later, however, the mullah received a message from the Pakistan administration not to convert anybody or encourage them to stay. So, he advised my father to leave as soon as possible. We were all set to go when our neighbours and some people from outside our village stormed our home. But our Christian servants protected us and managed to whisk us out unharmed. We had only two pieces of baggage. One was a shiny trunk, actually a decoy, containing a few clothes. In a small bag, we carried all our valuables �� gold, cash and whatever we could stuff in it.
It had rained the night before and the road was wet. My mother was nearing 50. She had never walked out of the house; now she was running on bare feet. There were about 1,000 people in that caravan, guarded by the army on three sides. People were standing on their rooftops, watching us pass. My brother�셲 Muslim friends ran up to embrace him and say goodbye. My friends were also waving to me from a distance. We spent the night in a primary school. There was no light, no bathroom.
Early the next morning, army trucks took us to the next camp in Gujranwala city, where there was complete chaos. We heard there that my mother�셲 ancestral village had been attacked and many people had been killed. My mother, naturally, was very upset. My brother had also been there then. But, pretending to be a Muslim, he had escaped.
When our caravan finally crossed the border, there were shouts of: �쏦industan zindabad! Bharatmata zindabad!�� (�쏬ong live Mother India!��) People were sobbing. Food and water were being handed around. It was a great relief to be safe, finally. Since we had relatives in Delhi, we decided to go there.
We were able to find space on a train, but it was crammed full of wounded passengers and wailing children. I was excited, because it was my first time on a train, but the stench of blood was overpowering. Our carriage was disconnected at Samalkha in Haryana, where, for the first time, I saw pigs, peacocks and monkeys. The people of Samalkha arranged food. They sent a doctor to tend the wounded. They called us Pakistanis, but they were very helpful.
Coming from a village, I was wonderstruck by Delhi. My cousin wanted to show me around, so he took me on a bicycle to see the sights, which were all deserted.
Almost overnight, Delhi�셲 population swelled from half a million to one and a half million. Necessities were in short supply. You needed a ration card for everything. There were long queues for supplies and fights broke out frequently. People thought British rule was much better. Government machinery had been expanded enormously to cope with the demands, and new recruits were refugees. This brought a lot of corruption, since everybody wanted to make money. That was the atmosphere at that time.
I was a teenager and living in Lahore, near the railway station. Though we Muslims were in the majority, ours was a mixed area, with Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs living in close proximity. To my knowledge, there hadn�셳 been any trouble before. Yes, we didn�셳 eat at each other�셲 houses, but otherwise we lived on amicable terms. Opposite our house were a number of shops owned by Hindus. As partition neared, most of them left for Delhi. But a grocer, having sent his family on for safety, had stayed back to wrap up his business. Our Muslim servants frequented his shop and were friends with him. When the killings started, they smuggled him into our home for safety. And there he stayed, while the city burned and the streets piled up with dead bodies.
One day, I was standing on the veranda fronting our bungalow. Since the house was on a plinth, I had a good view of the street outside and saw the shopkeeper creep out of the gate. I think, because he was a strict Hindu, he had a problem sharing a toilet with our Muslim staff and was going out to relieve himself. Before I could call out, a mob descended on him. One minute he was carefully closing the gate and the next he had been torn to shreds. I must have screamed, because my elder brother charged out, clamped a hand over my eyes and dragged me back into the house.. But it was too late. I had already seen everything: when they slit his throat, a fountain of blood shot up, and they ripped open his stomach so that his intestines spilled out. It has been 70 years, but I can�셳 forget that sight.
We had a beautiful house on Empress Road in Lahore. Built in 1933, it was the first �쐌odern�� art deco house in the city. There was a sweeping marble staircase, a fine library, parquet flooring and a garden spread over three acres. There was also a swimming pool and an orchard of fruit trees. In addition to my father�셲 library, the house was full of treasures my mother had collected �� S챔vres china, Venetian glass, antique silver. My father, Kanwar Dalip Singh (a grandson of the Maharaja of Kapurthala), was a high court judge. My mother, Reva, was a bon vivant and a famous hostess. There would be formal dinners at our table that could seat 18, plus dancing and live bands and music recitals and amateur dramatics. Although our ancestors were Sikhs, my father was Christian and my mother was a follower of Brahmo Samaj, a reformist Hindu movement. They had many Muslim friends, who were constantly in and out of our house.
I was born in Lahore and educated there. In July 1947, I left for England. I was there when partition happened. My parents were in Lahore. Sensing the way the wind was blowing, my father had already decided to sell the house to the US consulate. My father�셲 closest friends were two Muslim gentlemen, Feroz Khan Noon (later Pakistan�셲 prime minister) and Khizar Hayat Tiwana (premier of the Punjab until 1947) and they pleaded with my father not to leave. He was a Christian, he would be safe. But my father was adamant. He said, presciently, that there would be no place for minorities in Pakistan or India.
As we had family in Delhi, he thought we would go there. When the murders and the plundering began, Feroz and Khizar provided Muslim sentries to protect us. But all around was mayhem. My parents lingered until the beginning of August, when another dear Muslim friend, Ishat Habibullah, told my parents: �쏥o now, while you can. Don�셳 worry about your things. I�셪l look after them.�� My parents packed two suitcases and left. I think it was the hardest thing they ever did. My father never recovered. It wasn�셳 the house �� Maharajah Harnam Singh, my grandfather, had walked away from the state of Kapurthala when he converted to Christianity, so what was a mere house? It was the attack on that community of friendship, the plural, liberal values he lived by, that broke his heart.
Delhi was like going to another planet. My parents couldn�셳 read the street signs, which were in Hindi, not Urdu. They had lost their community. Then came a surprise. A few months later, they received a letter from Ishat telling them he was sending their things. Trucks duly arrived from Lahore, filled with everything they had left �� down to the notepaper in my mother�셲 desk, stamped with our Empress Road address �� except for my mother�셲 S챔vres dinner service, my father�셲 edition of Shakespeare�셲 folio that he had received as a wedding present (I later discovered both had been purloined by the Americans) and our dining table, which was too big to put into the truck.
I was born in that house on Empress Road. I had thought I would die there. Like my father, I never recovered. The one thing that displaced people know is that they will never go home. Save for a brief period of my life when I lived in London and managed to find some likeminded people, I have never felt at home again.
�쏧 was seven years old at partition. My father was a lieutenant colonel in command of a hospital in a lovely hill station called Murree, in what became Pakistan. Independence had taken place a week earlier, but everything seemed calm and quiet. We were in no hurry to leave; we hadn�셳 packed anything. On 24 August, my father went to see a good friend of his, a Hindu, who was a civilian doctor. There were rumours in the market that there was going to be trouble and we Hindus were advised to leave. But my father�셲 friend was adamant he wasn�셳 leaving. Born in Murree, he had practised there for 40 years. The next morning, he was discovered in his house, lying dead in a pool of blood. My father decided to get the family out immediately. We left our house as it was.
I remember being made to lie on the floor of the truck because all along the 30-mile journey to army headquarters at Rawalpindi our vehicle was being fired on by snipers. Finally, we reached the army mess, where there was a military Dakota plane leaving for Delhi. My father managed to get my mother, myself, my younger sister and one of our servants on that flight. We sat on the floor alongside lots of soldiers, the family of a Sikh doctor and a number of sacks.
The day we arrived at my aunt�셲 in Delhi, her Muslim dhobi [washerman] staggered into the house clutching his abdomen. His stomach had been slashed and he was holding his intestines.
By September, trains were arriving from Pakistan full of dead bodies. My father and his Hindu colleague, Dr Basu, had joined a convoy of trucks from Rawalpindi to Delhi. They left around 29 August and we didn�셳 know whether they were dead or alive until the end of September, when my exhausted father arrived and told us about thousands of refugees and the River Jhelum, which had run red with blood. Dr Basu and my father, who was a surgeon, had operated on wounded people left by the road. They ran out of anaesthetic and catgut so they made do with ordinary thread. Luckily, they had a big canteen containing liquor, so they made patients drink it as anaesthetic and poured it on to wounds to stop infection.
I grew up and became a painter. It strikes me as strange that very little art came out of those experiences. I think we don�셳 want to remember.

From the moment a small boat nudged the shore of Mumbai's Fisherman's Colony on Wednesday evening and decanted eight young men clad in orange anoraks, the plan was simple: kill and keep killing to the very last breath.
The little group paused to shed their waterproof jackets, revealing jeans and T-shirts. Picking up their bulging rucksacks from the black inflatable, they turned silently and set off towards the heart of India's financial capital.
The beach was virtually empty, most of the residents of the area having retreated indoors to watch the final stages of the one-day cricket match between India and England. India won, but it was the last piece of good news the country would have until yesterday morning when Mumbai was finally freed from the grip of an audacious terrorist outrage that claimed the lives of at least 195 people.
For 62 hours, the gunmen roamed freely around some of the city's most prestigious hotels, killing at random, holding Mumbai and the wider world in horrified thrall.
Despite the lure of the cricket, one man had ventured out onto the beach on Wednesday evening. Bharat Tamore, an assistant supervisor at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, was gazing out to sea when he spotted the dinghy drifting noiselessly towards the beach.
It was 9.15pm and by the light of the moon Tahore watched the men jump off. They were young, no more than 25, thin and good-looking, 'like Bollywood stars,' he recalled later, although their faces wore a grim, determined look. On their backs were blue rucksacks, and in their hands red carry-bags heavy enough to cause one of the smaller men to stumble. They were students, they said, when he asked what they were doing: 'They told me that they were tense and that they didn't need any more tension.'
The young men slipped away into the night in the direction of the Taj Mahal Palace and the ornate splendour of the Gateway of India.
But they were not the only ones on the move. Across the southern tip of the city, others were also collecting weapons and heading out to get the carnage under way. How many there were, no one seems quite sure: as many as 40, some sources suggested.
The key questions are what they intended to achieve in their murderous rampage, their identities, and who sent them to Mumbai. Answers are likely to come in the first instance from one of those who clambered out of the inflatable on Wednesday night - 21-year-old Mohammad Ajmal Mohammad Amin Kasab - the only terrorist known to have been captured alive by Indian security forces. As details of his interrogation were disclosed yesterday in the Indian media, the first proper understanding of what happened in three days of bloodshed began to emerge out of the contradictory details - building a case that pointed ever more strongly towards Pakistan. It is not just the Indian media who are saying out loud what many suspected, but also state officials. What they had only hinted at in the beginning - with Kasab's interrogation - was yesterday stated more boldly. '[The] investigation carried out so far has revealed the hand of Pakistan-based groups in the Mumbai attack,' said Sri Prakash Jaiswal, India's Minister of State for Home Affairs.
As Kasab left the docks, it was in the company of a man the police say has been identified as Ismail Khan, the terrorists splitting into pairs of small kill teams.
The journey that followed across Mumbai - described in the Indian press - took the two men first by taxi to the CST railway station, where Kasab was chillingly photographed as he paused, amid the gunfire and grenades that killed as many as 50 people, in grey combat trousers, a dark blue T-shirt and wearing a rucksack with spare ammunition on one shoulder.
From the railway station Khan and Kasab moved on to the Cama and GT hospitals, firing as they went. According to the same sources, it was during their progress through Mumbai that the pair shot dead the Anti-Terrorism Squad chief Hemant Karkare and another senior officer. Their killing spree was only halted when Khan was shot down in the Girgaum Chowpatty locality of south Mumbai, and when Kasab surrendered.
Now Kasab is talking, and what he has to say is likely to define the future relations of two nuclear-armed rivals - India and Pakistan. Yesterday a Pakistani official said it would divert troops to its border with India and away from fighting militants on the Afghan frontier, if tensions erupt in the wake of the attacks on Mumbai. That the tensions will increase in the coming days seems likely.
Already, if the accounts of his questioning are to be believed, Kasab has revealed that, like him, most of his fellow attackers hailed from Pakistan - although that has yet to be confirmed. He revealed that the group had been planning the attack for months. Some are thought to have taken jobs in the targeted hotels, others had checked in as guests a few days earlier, using their rooms to stockpile weapons. Kasab - from Faridkot in Pakistan - and eight others had visited Mumbai a few months earlier, posing as students and taking a room in the Colaba market area, which they used as a safe-house to store the supplies they would need for the attacks. According to police, Kasab told them that the main planner arrived in Mumbai a month ago to film potential targets to help train the gunmen. Once he was satisfied that they were ready, the boat team members were each issued with an AK-47 rifle, a pistol, 350 bullets and eight hand-grenades.
A recovered GPS device suggested they set out from the Pakistani port of Karachi in a larger boat - though such is the friction between the two countries that such reports have to be treated with caution - before overpowering the crew of another vessel and sailing to within four nautical miles of Mumbai. There, they transferred to speedboats and made for the shore. So began a night of terror.
Even as Kasab and Khan were attacking the CST station, another pair of gunmen hit the the Leopold Caf챕, a popular haunt for backpackers. Witnesses described how the gunmen took weapons out of backpacks and hurled grenades, killing at least one person. More gunmen moved through the area in a hijacked police vehicle, firing indiscriminately.
At Nariman House, the attackers went for a Jewish centre run by Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, and his wife Rivka. The couple's son Moshe, two, was rescued by his nanny. They were the only survivors.
But the images of horror that will forever be associated with one of India's darkest days were reserved for elsewhere - the imposing Oberoi and Taj Mahal Palace hotels, frequented by Western business travellers and well-heeled Indians. Here it was the restaurants that took the brunt of the initial assault, but the terrorists quickly fanned out to round up more hostages. At the Taj, the first shots were fired near the swimming pool before the gunmen swarmed into the hotel.
It was in the Taj that a sinister new element to the attack emerged. Survivors said the gunmen were particularly interested in British and American guests, singling them out as targets and ignoring other nationalities. Guests scattered in panic as the carnage continued. 'There were people getting shot in the corridor. There was someone dead outside the bathroom,' said 28-year-old Australian former Neighbours actress Brooke Satchwell.
Bharat Tamore had reached the hotel only a few minutes earlier. Changing into his uniform ready for the night shift, he heard gunshots coming from the fashionable Shamiana restaurant above. 'I stepped out and saw staff and guests running. It was then I remembered those eight boys,' he said.
Paralysed by fear, he crouched with staff in the kitchen, listening to the crump of explosions and crackle of machine-gun fire until 4am, when they made a dash for freedom.
At the Oberoi, Madhu Kumar, 58, had sat down to a meal with her husband Ashok, 65, and two friends. Panic spread through the room as a gunman burst in, herding them up the stairs. 'He had a scarf like a bandana and a scarf on his mouth and he was carrying a machine gun,' she said. 'There was a stampede. We had heard a commotion and a lot of loud firing. Everybody got panicky. I saw a girl with a bleeding arm. She had been shot.'
She noticed that the gunman was quite fair-skinned and spoke in English - he was a Kashmiri, perhaps, she said. As they moved up the stairs, she heard a gunshot behind her. 'This man was shot by a terrorist behind us. The terrorist said "wait", and I heard the shot and he fell. They were just shooting people at random.'
Caught on the hop and hopelessly outgunned, police struggled to cope. The first team to respond consisted of just eight members of the Mumbai force, each armed with a revolver. It took until 2am for the first military personnel to arrive, a group of 40 Marine commandos summoned from their beds to go to the Taj. Even then, no one was able to give them any information about the layout of the hotel. They did not know the strength of their opponents or what weapons they possessed. Entering the hotel, they found about 15 bodies, but before they could do anything else the terrorists opened fire and hurled grenades. By the time the firing stopped, the gunmen had slipped away into the maze of corridors and passageways in the old building.
Now in the aftermath that has left almost 200 dead - perhaps more in the final counting - it is not simply the question of who sent Kasab and his fellow gunmen to Mumbai that is exercising a shocked India. After three days of combat in which a handful of highly trained and motivated gunmen held off against massively superior Indian forces before being at last overwhelmed, what India wants to know is how its security forces could have been caught so flat-footed yet again, when they should have been at the highest state of vigilance after a series of murderous attacks around the country this year.
How, too, some asked, had they failed so dramatically to bring the situation under control during the best part of three days?
Sitting in a side street listening to the sound of loud blasts and gunfire emanating from Nariman House, Rakash Bhaud, the local leader of the far-right Hindu party Shiv Sena, blamed the central government for the failures that, he said, had left them at the mercy of Pakistan-backed terrorists.
'There is a deep anger here against the government for not providing security for the common people,' he said. 'The extremists have taken advantage of this. We don't have the security to fight against this.'
If the attackers' intention was to stir up tensions between India and Pakistan - and by extension, Hindu and Muslim - they most certainly succeeded. Anti-Pakistan slogans were being chanted freely by the crowds who gathered to watch the storming of Nariman House.
As the firing died away yesterday morning, the work of getting the city back on its feet began. In the restaurant at the Oberoi hotel, staff were starting to sweep the broken glass away from the tables on which meals abandoned by the fleeing guests still lay. But it may take a lot longer to sweep away the memories of the events of last week and the old enmities it has stirred up.
For now, however, it is a moment for India to come to terms with what has happened. 'I had arranged to meet a friend in the Oberoi Trident lobby on Wednesday night,' said Malani Agarwal, 31, a radio presenter on Mumbai Radio. 'He said he was coming late, so I went upstairs to a lounge bar called the Dragon Fly which is a few doors away. Then we saw a lot of "fireworks" in the lobby. Ten minutes later we felt a tremor. That was the first grenade, then another one. People started getting texts about a gang war at Leopold's Caf챕 and then the Oberoi. The Dragon Caf챕 has bulletproof glass and you could see bullets lodged in the windows. That was really scary. We put the television onto the news and saw the Taj burning. The army coming. We all just felt numb. Too scared to move really. It was the worst night of my life. This will be a wake-up call.'
The sight of the army on Britain�셲 streets after the Manchester suicide bomb attack is a clear sign that the UK�셲 foreign policy and approach to fighting terrorism is not working, Jeremy Corbyn has said.
The Labour leader said there must be more money for law enforcement, as he suggested Britain�셲 intervention in wars abroad had fuelled the risk of terrorism at home.
�쏮any experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services, have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home,�� he said.
His comments drew immediate criticism from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, with Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, accusing Corbyn of �쐖ery muddled and dangerous thinking�� that implied blame on Britain for somehow bringing the Manchester terror attack on itself.
Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, intensified the attack, saying Corbyn�셲 comments were �쏿bsolutely monstrous��. Speaking alongside the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he said it was �쏿bsolutely extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way��.
However, Corbyn pitched his intervention carefully, saying he was clear that terrorists were entirely to blame for their own actions but that governments must also examine the effectiveness of their policy decisions.
�쏯o rationale based on the actions of any government can remotely excuse, or even adequately explain, outrages like this week�셲 massacre,�� he said, speaking in Westminster.
�쏝ut we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is simply not working. We need a smarter way to reduce the threat from countries that nurture terrorists and generate terrorism.��
A Labour government would ensure that �쐎ur foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country��, he added.
He said seeing the army on �쐎ur own streets today is a stark reminder that the current approach has failed��.
The longtime peace campaigner and former chair of the Stop the War coalition also made a direct promise to troops that under a Labour government they would only be sent into combat abroad if they were properly resourced, and there was a clear need for military intervention and a plan for lasting peace afterwards.
�쏷hat is my commitment to our armed services,�� he said. �쏷his is my commitment to our country. I want the solidarity, humanity and compassion that we have seen on the streets of Manchester this week to be the values that guide our government. There can be no love of country if there is neglect or disregard for its people.��
His speech marked the return of Labour to national campaigning after a pause following the Manchester Arena suicide bombing, which killed 22 people and injured 116 after an Ariana Grande pop concert aimed at young girls.
Corbyn�셲 event started with a minute�셲 silence and he did not take questions afterwards, as aides said the campaign was being �쐏hased in��.
With less than a fortnight until polling day, Labour is gaining ground on the Conservatives, who are now just five points ahead, according to the latest YouGov poll for the Times.
Corbyn�셲 speech emphasised that he was only blaming terrorists for the attack, and he stressed he did not want to �쐌ake a narrow party political point��.
But he made clear criticisms of Theresa May�셲 record as home secretary, when she oversaw cuts to policing.
He told his audience in London that a government led by his party would provide more resources for law enforcement and the NHS to ensure people were �쐍ot protected and cared for on the cheap��.
Within hours of the speech, Fallon, who has often been used by the Tories as an attack dog in elections, told the BBC and Sky that Corbyn was �쐇mplying this attack might be our fault, might be Britain�셲 fault as a result of our foreign policy��.�쏷his is a very badly timed speech, showing some very muddled and dangerous thinking. He seems to be implying that a terrorist attack in Manchester is somehow our fault, it�셲 somehow Britain�셲 fault. Jeremy Corbyn is far too ready to find excuses and far too slow to support the police and the security services.
�쏷his is a man, by the way, who has opposed every piece of terrorist legislation, who thinks we should talk to terrorists, and who�셲 even questioned whether police should be right to shoot to kill.��
He said the number of armed officers on the streets had increased, and claimed the safety of people was not just about overall numbers of police but frequency of patrols and funding for the intelligence services.
�쏧t also means being tough against terrorism and that is where Mr Corbyn is weak, it is where he lets himself down,�� he said.
Johnson added to the attack after meeting his US counterpart in London. �쏷his is a moment ... when we should be coming together, uniting to defeat these people, and we can and we will, not just in Iraq and in Syria but of course in the battle for the hearts and minds,�� he said. �쏷hey are wrong, their view of the world is a corruption and perversion of Islam and it can be completely confounded.
�쏝ut now is not the time to do anything to subtract from the fundamental responsibility of those individuals, that individual in particular, who committed this atrocity and I think it is absolutely monstrous that anybody should seek to do so.��
Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, also criticised Corbyn�셲 speech, saying: �쏛 few days ago, a young man built a bomb, walked into a pop concert and deliberately slaughtered children. Our children. Families are grieving. A community is in shock. Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to use that grotesque act to make a political point.��
Farron added: �쏧 don�셳 agree with what he says, but I disagree even more that now is the time to say it. That�셲 not leadership, it�셲 putting politics before people at a time of tragedy.��
But Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general and former Liberty campaigner, said Corbyn had been �쐓ubject to horrible character attacks�� and people misinterpreting his speech.
She told the BBC�셲 World At One: �쏧 hear the criticism, but that is not my reading of the speech. Jeremy was clear there was absolutely no excuse, no justification based in foreign policy for the atrocities we�셶e seen. However, it is right he says to the military, as a PM in waiting, it is because there is clear need and there will be a plan �� you�셱e correct that ill-conceived conflicts will be jumped on as an excuse. But the reason not to engage in ill-conceived conflict is because it is ill-conceived.��
Corbyn and his close aides have long held the view that British foreign policy, including the involvement of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he vehemently opposed, has exacerbated the risk of terrorist attacks by destabilising the Middle East and fuelling suspicion of the west.
A leaked EU report examining the terror attacks in Berlin, Paris and Brussels warns of gaping holes in the ability of the security services to monitor movements in and out of Europe.
The document, obtained by the Guardian, notes that all those who committed or sought to commit large-scale terror attacks in recent years crossed the EU�셲 external border �쏿t some point prior to committing their attacks��. It warns that even EU citizens subject to a European arrest warrant were able to enter the continent freely or to leave �쐗ithout being detected due to the non-systematic check of EU citizens��.
Under the current system, it is also impossible for cross-national databases to be searched using biometric data, such as fingerprints.
The authors of the document, drawn up by the European commission�셲 security union taskforce, write that the Schengen Border Code �쐂id not allow for the systematic consultation�� of national and international databases, leaving the security services unable to carry out basic checks that could have avoided the ensuing bloodshed.�쏛nother shared aspect of many of the recent attacks is movement within the EU, be it by the perpetrators or their supporters in preparation for an attack or subsequent escape; or to traffic the means that support terrorists, such as illegal firearms and explosives��, they write. �쏷his raises the question of whether more can be done to enhance security within the Schengen area. This could include action to enhance police checks in internal border regions and along main transport routes.��
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who is suspected of being the overall field commander behind the Paris attacks in 2015, was the subject of both a European and an international arrest warrant, yet travelled from Belgium to Syria via Egypt in March 2013 before returning to Europe. He then left for Syria again, taking a flight from Cologne to Istanbul.
Anis Amri, who murdered 12 people last December by driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, was a failed asylum seeker in Italy, who later entered Germany from Switzerland despite being a suspected terrorist. He used various aliases to avoid detection.
The taskforce further warns of failings in the sharing of information between member states about individuals who are believed to be a risk. �쏮any of the individuals involved in recent terrorist attacks in the EU had [mostly petty] criminal records,�� the taskforce writes.
�쏛 further common element between recent attacks is the appearance of many of the suspects on surveillance lists, especially national watch lists. In a number of cases, perpetrators were subject to SIS [Schengen informaton system] alerts, which are an important tool in the detection of suspected terrorists.
�쏷he number of alerts has significantly increased in the last two years, but there remain differences between the way in which member states use the system, including a lack of consistency in the use of SIS alerts. Should an obligation for information sharing be introduced for all existing EU security databases? Should those databases be searchable by biometric as well as alphanumeric data?��
According to the taskforce, the European commission is now assessing the feasibility of establishing a European police record information system, so that national police forces�� information is collated centrally. It is the commission�셲 intention to pilot a project under which security services can ask the new EU system to confirm whether someone has a criminal record in any of the member states.
The European parliament will debate the EU�셲 ability to secure its citizens on Wednesday to mark the coming anniversary of the attacks in Brussels that killed 32 people, along with the three suicide bombers.
What we know so far about the Finsbury Park terror attack
Just four days into his premiership, Gordon Brown was dealing with the most dangerous situation facing Britain since the attacks on London in July 2005. Police and intelligence officers confirmed that there was a direct link between the Scottish attack and the attempted car bombing of London on Friday - confirming the reality of a renewed UK offensive by Islamist extremists.
Last night the Prime Minister summoned intelligence chiefs and ministers before the Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall to discuss the deteriorating security situation. It was agreed to raise the threat level to the highest degree possible, a decision that confirmed another attack is expected imminently.
In a televised address from Downing Street, a sombre-faced Brown urged people to be 'vigilant' and support the police and security services. He said: 'I know that the British people will stand together, united, resolute and strong.'
As night fell, armed police began stopping vehicles entering airports throughout the UK after warnings were circulated that a nationwide terror cell is preparing more attacks. Liverpool John Lennon airport was closed at 8.30pm while police investigated a suspect vehicle. Glasgow airport too remained closed.
At 3.11pm, a Jeep Cherokee wreathed in flames was crashed into the doors of the main terminal building at Glasgow. Driven by two 'Asian-looking' men, it came to a halt as they threw petrol over it and appeared to try to detonate the vehicle. With the help of bystanders, the two men were overpowered and arrested. One was fighting for his life last night, after throwing petrol over himself and setting it alight.
There was a further twist last night as the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, where the man was being treated, was evacuated. Strathclyde Police later said that the man had possibly been wearing a suicide vest.
William Rae, chief constable of Strathclyde Police, last night confirmed that the attack on Glasgow airport was linked to the London attempt. 'There are similarities between this incident and those in London. We are treating this as a terrorist incident.' The Jeep attack, bearing the hallmarks, police said, of an al-Qaeda plot, came 36 hours after extremists attempted a double car bomb attack in the heart of London's West End.
Two people were arrested in Cheshire late last night in connection with the London and Glasgow failed terrorist attacks, which appear to have slipped completely under the radar of the security services. The pair were arrested by anti-terrorism officers from the Metropolitian and West Midlands Police.
Intelligence sources confirmed the attack on Glasgow airport appeared to be aimed at killing passengers.
As with the failed London attack, the explosives and gas canisters which appeared to be in the Jeep did not detonate, a stroke of fortune that may again have saved the lives of hundreds.
Witnesses described chaotic scenes as the Jeep sped towards the terminal entrance. Robin Patterson, 42, of Rochester, Kent, saw the car burst into flames. 'There was an enormous explosion,' he said. 'The guy next to the car, his skin and clothes just fell off him.' Another described one of the men throwing punches at police while screaming: 'Allah, Allah'.
The Prime Minister's new terrorism adviser, Lord Stevens, said last night: 'Make no mistake, this weekend's bomb attacks signal a major escalation by Islamic terrorists.' Meanwhile in London, a massive investigation into what could have been Britain's most deadly terror attack widened last night. Police and intelligence sources told The Observer that they were now investigating the existence of an Islamic terror cell in the capital. One major branch of the inquiry is tracking down a number of terror suspects who have slipped their control orders, a development that raises fresh questions over their effectiveness.
One man being sought is Lamine Adam, 26, who, in evidence at the recent Crevice terror trial that saw five jailed for plotting fertiliser bomb attacks in the UK, allegedly boasted of targeting nightclubs. One of the Mercedes cars involved in the attack was left outside the busy Tiger Tiger nightclub in Haymarket, in the centre of the West End. The other Mercedes was found in a nearby street.
Other men urgently wanted by police are his brother Ibrahim, 20, and Cerie Bullivant, 24, who have also evaded control orders. The government's independent reviewer of anti-terror legislation, Lord Carlile, has said that there is 'solid evidence' that the trio had wanted to join insurgents abroad and attack British troops serving in Iraq. Security sources said it remains 'possible' that the men were involved in the attempt to bring carnage to London.
After being briefed on the progress of the police investigation, the new Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, released a statement urging greater vigilance. It read: 'The police are clear that the most important contribution that the public can make is to carry on reporting anything suspicious and to remain vigilant. I must stress we must not let the threat of terror stop us getting on with our lives.'
The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, reiterated that the capital faced 'a very real threat' and called on Londoners to be 'vigilant'. Hundreds of extra police were drafted on to the streets to step up security and to reassure the public.
The Gay Pride Festival, which saw hundreds of thousands of people making their way from Baker Street to Trafalgar Square, was accompanied by 350 officers, while extra police were drafted in for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Diana, Princess of Wales, concert at Wembley.
Among other terror suspects police want to track down are former tube worker and 26-year-old Londoner Zeeshan Siddiqui. A court has heard how he trained with a London suicide bomber in Pakistan.
Another individual police want to track down, even if only to eliminate him from their investigation, is Bestun Salim, who disappeared from his Manchester home last year, and is alleged to have links to Ansar al-Islam, a group linked to the terrorist network of the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraq's notorious insurgent leader who was killed last year.
Donald Trump appeared to invent a terrorist attack in Sweden during a campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday, inviting questions that he may have confused the Scandinavian country with a city in Pakistan.
With thousands of supporters gathered in an aircraft hangar in Melbourne, Florida, Trump used his speech to talk about migration in Europe and linked it to terror attacks in Brussels, Nice and Paris. He then added Sweden to the list, incorrectly stating that an attack had happened there on Friday.
Trump told supporters: �쏻e�셶e got to keep our country safe. You look at what�셲 happening in Germany, you look at what�셲 happening last night in Sweden.��
�쏶weden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They�셱e having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what�셲 happening in Brussels. You look at what�셲 happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.��
There were questions about whether Trump had confused Sweden with Sehwan in Pakistan, where more than 85 people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Sufi shrine on Thursday.
Some Swedes were baffled by the comments. One of Sweden�셲 official Twitter accounts, controlled by a different citizen each week, currently a school librarian, said:
Sweden�셲 foreign ministry spokeswoman, Catarina Axelsson, said the government wasn�셳 aware of any �쐔error-linked major incidents��.She told the Associated Press that the Swedish embassy in Washington contacted the State Department on Sunday to request clarification of Trump�셲 remarks and was waiting for an answer.
The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted: �쏶weden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.��
The source of Trump�셲 remark is unclear, but it came after Fox News aired an interview with film-maker Ami Horowitz, whose latest documentary examines whether high crime rates in areas of Sweden is linked to its previous open-door policy on people fleeing war and persecution.
According to the 2016 Swedish Crime Survey, crime rates in Sweden have stayed relatively stable over the last decade, with some fluctuations. In 2015, there were 112 cases of lethal violence in Sweden, an increase of 25 cases compared with 2014, but assaults, threats, sexual offences, car theft, burglary and harassment all reduced compared to the previous year �� as did anxiety about crime in society.
Trump�셲 comments come after Kellyanne Conway, one of his senior advisers, was ridiculed for blaming two Iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened.
At the start of February Conway cited the fictitious �쏝owling Green massacre�� in an interview backing the travel ban imposed on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Two Iraqi men living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, were arrested in 2011 over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-Qaida in Iraq. They are currently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences, but there was no massacre, nor were they accused of planning one.
On 29 January, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, referred three times to an attack in Atlanta �� where a string of bombings were carried out in 1996 and 1997.
Later, in an email to ABC News, he wrote that he �쐁learly meant Orlando��.
Forty-nine people were killed and more injured in the attack at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the Floridian city in June. It was carried out by Omar Mateen, a US citizen born in New York to Afghan parents. Afghanistan is not on the list of countries under Trump�셲 travel ban.
Trump has repeatedly accused what he described as the �쐂ishonest media�� of producing �쐄ake news��. He repeated the attack on Saturday stating: �쏻hen the media lies to people I will never ever let them get away with it.��
He added: �쏻e are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live and what to believe,�� he said. �쏻e are free, independent people and we will make our own choices.��
After Trump�셲 remarks in Florida, the Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet posted a story about crime that really had occurred in Sweden on Friday. Non-fake news it ran included: �쏡ue to harsh weather in northern parts of Sweden the road E10 was closed between Katterjakk and Riksgransen�� and �쏿 man died in hospital, after an accident in the workplace earlier that day��.
It added: �쏰K let�셲 not be fake news, this story took place in the autumn, but was reported Friday before lunchtime and we thought you would like it. A wooden moose got the attention of a lovesick moose bull.��
To which one of his followers replied:
Another Twitter user posted a picture of famous Swedish export Abba, writing: �쏤our extremists responsible for #swedenincident are still at large, if you see these people phone @realDonaldTrump at once.��
After attacks such as Nice, we demand answers. A requirement to understand is necessary both to protect ourselves in the future and to deal with the consequences of horror. What was the motivation? Are there links to other individuals? How did the killer arrive at the decision to kill?
That desire to understand is hardly a new phenomenon, although modern media have made it more pervasive. Joseph Conrad, in the complex character of Verloc �� the anarchist bomber, double agent and provocateur of the The Secret Agent �� was an early explorer of this territory.
White people who buy guns to shoot up cinemas and schools are put into one category: �쐋one wolves��. And inevitably the focus is on psychological and social problems. Individuals from a Muslim background are instantly placed in another category: �쐔errorists��. But when it comes to attacks such as those in Nice and Orlando, the distinction is increasingly unclear.
If those two attacks �� as seems very possible �� were as much about the inadequacies of the attackers as about Islamic State; if Isis, or simply the fact of the attention given to such mass killings claimed by Isis, is no more than a nudge that legitimises, in the perpetrator�셲 mind, mass killing �� then perhaps there is no meaningful distinction.
Part of the problem is that we have come to expect to see in these attacks, especially jihadi-inspired events, certain attributes. But like the proverbial generals always fighting the last war, there is a time lag in our understanding of the patterns of violence.
There is the inevitable search for evidence that these are thoroughly organised murders �� leaving behind an email trail, evidence of contact and warnings of intent on social media. There is an expectation of a familiar path to radicalisation or membership of a group. It should have a coherent justification.
This is the model of 9/11 and al-Qaida: violence marked by a certain fastidiousness of purpose, and long in the planning. That path was understood: individuals were recruited, travelled to training camps in foreign warzones and drawn into plans that were sometimes years in the making. The new kind of outrage, though, appears very different.
A key innovation of Isis has been to reverse the polarity of responsibility: encouraging acts of violence that it accepts as bloody tributes thrown at its feet. That has best been summed up in statements by Isis spokesmen such as Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, who in 2014 encouraged ad hoc attacks using whatever tools are easily available, including vehicles.
And while Isis is organised in places where it is strong, and is capable of setting up cells outside its own territory, it has also recognised that all it needs to do to widen its impact is to provide a lethal context for attacks �� a convenient peg for the angry and alienated.
The crucial point that many have missed is that it does not actually matter to Isis whether there is any real connection: whether the new �쐓oldiers�� it claims after the fact are more disturbed than ideological. What matters is the fact of the act alone and its power to frighten, divide and destabilise �� and that the attack is understood to be inspired by Isis.
The problem for western governments and security forces is that even if that is actually understood, it is hard to convey to a frightened population for whom such subtleties are meaningless. It is also a risky argument. To say that �쐒adicalisation�� can be so instantaneous plays into the hands of individuals such as Donald Trump who would present all Muslims as a risk. Then there is the practical issue of what this means for law enforcement if what we are talking about is an individualistic and post-ideological attraction to violence looking for a model to copy, then that is close to impossible to counter.
If there is a parallel that should serve as a warning �� and I make the comparison extremely carefully and with many caveats �� it is to be found in some of the incidents that have occurred during the so-called �쐊nife intifada�� in the occupied territories. There, smarter Israeli security officials, if not the political cadre, were quick to recognise that one category of those involved in attacks were those with personal problems for whom the act of violence, emulating others, gave a retroactive meaning to their deaths. Again, a common feature in many incidents was a lack of any warnings and few if any connections to groups that might afterwards have praised the attacks.
What this means is that there will have to be a fundamental rethinking of how we seek to describe such events. It is an issue that has become all the more urgent as the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said today that no links have been established yet between the attacker and Isis.
But what if, in this context, that idea of radicalisation is essentially meaningless and what we mean is something more vague, akin to an emotional response? Where an unstable individual �� perhaps already prone to grandiose, deadly and narcissistic thoughts �� borrows the forms and ideas of a certain kind of mass killing because they are familiar?
And the tragic reality �� and the twisted genius of Isis�셲 pitch �� is that it does not matter. They have supplied permission, mediated both via their own outlets and conventional media and through the acts they claim.
And what that implies is that the already false distinction between the disturbed �쐋one wolf�� individual and organised �쐔error�� as we have understood it, has broken down. Our tools for understanding motive have failed.
Returning to Conrad, all we really have left is the name-tag tied to Stevie �� the young man with learning disabilities Verloc sends to deliver his explosives and who dies in the act. A violence whose shape increasingly appears unknowable.
Four victims died after a single terrorist staged an attack in central London on Wednesday, killing three members of the public as he careered across Westminster Bridge in a 4x4 car and stabbing a policeman to death outside parliament. This is how the events unfolded.
There are a lot of Dan Simmons books in our house, but they are not mine. My husband adores Hyperion, Endymion and all his hard science fiction: I haven't got on with it, so when he brought home The Terror a few years ago, I didn't hold out high hopes. A few days later, I emerged from the novel, shivering, terrified and Arctic-obsessed. What better read for a winter weekend than a book about people even colder than you?
The Terror is Simmons's imagining of what happened on Captain Franklin's doomed 19th-century expedition to traverse the Northwest Passage. The real story is appalling enough: Franklin's two ships, the Erebus and the Terror, set off in 1845 but were trapped in the Arctic ice for years. None of the 100-plus men on the ships survived; little is known about how they died, but starvation, hypothermia, cannibalism and lead-poisoning from the canned food they took with them have all been posited.
Skilfully, horribly, Simmons details the months of darkness �� the temperatures of -50F and lower; the shrieking groans of the ice; the wind; the hunger �� from the multiple perspectives of the men on board the ship, and with such detail that I defy readers not to grab another jumper. He adds in another, more deliberate evil: a stalking, polar bear-like monster which tracks over the icy wastelands around the ships, picking the men off one by one. "To go out on the frozen sea in the dark now with that �� thing �� waiting in the jumble of pressure ridges and tall sastrugi was certain death," he writes. "Messages were passed between the ships now only during those dwindling minutes of half-light around noon. In a few days, there would be no real day at all, only arctic night. Roundtheclock night. One hundred days of night." What a horrifying thought.
The sailors realise the ice isn't going to melt enough to free their ships during the summer of 1847, that "there would be no release from this belly of the Leviathan winter this summer. No escape from the cold belly of this ice this year". When the Erebus is crushed by the ice, the remaining men eventually decide that their best bet is to take what is left of their provisions and flee south across the frozen sea. Stalked by "the thing on the ice", starving to death, they claw their way towards Canada.
At almost 1,000 pages, The Terror is no quick read. Not, previously, a Simmons fan, I'm still not quite sure why I started such a doorstopper, but I know I couldn't put it down. I am a sucker for the story of the desperate journey, of survival (or not) against great odds, of man against nature, whether fictional (come on Frodo and Sam!) or true (Graham Bowley's No Way Down: Life and Death on K2 was an excellent recent read). It's hard to imagine a more wretched situation than that faced by Franklin and his men. Simmons, with his "thing on the ice", gives it a go.
I said last week that the fireside scene in The Hundred and One Dalmatians was the cosiest, toastiest in literature. For sheer extremity-freezing, heart-stopping, unbearable wintry cold and misery, though, it has to be The Terror. It's a truly chilling horror novel, made even more terrifying when you remember that much of the horror Simmons describes is based on reality.

More than 80 people are thought to have been killed in a series of brutal attacks in Benue State in central Nigeria, which locals say were perpetrated by groups of nomadic herdsmen.
Although northern herdsmen have fought with locals over land and grazing rights for decades, what was a low-level conflict has recently spiralled into a full-blown crisis, leading to claims the men are �쐔he new Boko Haram��.
On Monday #Benuemassacre began trending on social media on Monday as Nigerians criticised the government�셲 delayed response to the escalating conflict.
Reliable statistics on the total number of people killed are scarce, but according to the Global Terrorism Index, 1,200 people were killed in 2014 by herdsmen, and in 2015 the Index claimed they were �쐔he fourth deadliest terror group in the world��.
But according to locals in Kogi, central Nigeria, the state�셲 new commercial airport was built on land previously used by herdsmen for cattle grazing. Across Nigeria, growing urbanisation, new infrastructure and the rising value of land has made life harder for nomadic groups.
Sola Tayo, an associate fellow at Chatham House, says the characterisation of the herdsmen as militants obscures the abuses they also face. �쏮edia reports largely focus on attacks carried out by herdsmen. What is not so widely reported are claims from herdsmen of attacks again them and their communities.
�쏷he current media narrative is of largely Christian settler communities being attacked by rampaging Muslim herdsmen, which is leading to further mistrust and division.��
Sanusi Baffa, chairman of an association of more than 300 Fulani herdsmen in the northern state of Kano, agrees that land scarcity is at the heart of the conflict, not politics or religion. �쏶ince the commonwealth era, herdsmen had their own designated land to graze their cattle. But now much of that land has been taken over by politicians and the government,�� he said.
He disputes the characterisation that the herdsmen are the aggressors. �쏮ost of the affected people are the nomads. Our cattle is regularly stolen and killed. We are being persecuted even more because our land is restricted and the government have created this crisis for us.��
Headlines such as �쏤ulani Militants are more dangerous than Boko Haram�� have further framed the herdsmen as an organised, political group.
Matthew Page, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an analyst on Nigeria for the US State Department, says this designation is widely disputed by Nigeria experts.
�쏧t unhelpfully labels one of west Africa�셲 largest ethnic groups as �쁳errorist�� based on the criminal acts of some Nigeria-based armed herdsmen. The heinous nature of several of the worst attacks have given domestic media outlets license to portray them as murderers and terrorists,�� he said.
While the widespread comparisons to Boko Haram are in part a reflection of the intensity of the conflict, it also plays on the prejudices held in the predominantly Christian south about the northern Muslim regions.
A number of politicians have stoked these divisions. In late May, the governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose, addressed crowds and vigilantes in an effected community in Ekiti State, and encouraged them to respond violently.
�쏷erminate their lives! Anywhere you find a cow that is grazing on our ways�� we will take them out�� Enough of this political herdsmen operating as herdsmen but are Boko Haram, they are coming into south-west gradually, we are going to fight you.��
In Anambra, governor Willie Obianno has commissioned aerial surveillance to keep track of the herdsmen�셲 movements, while in Enugu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has launched an inquiry to establish the causes behind the attacks.
But in a climate where ethnic sensitivities are heightening, and as the Nigerian economy continues to struggle, the challenge to find a peaceful resolution is becoming increasingly difficult.
Around Christmas, neighbours saw a van outside a small but comfortable home in the Winson Green neighbourhood of Birmingham. Khalid Masood, his partner and two children were moving out. Their new home was close by, but infinitely less salubrious. Their canalside terrace house had been swapped for a tiny bedsit above a restaurant on a busy road.
This and many other details will be picked over by analysts seeking to reconstitute the life of the man who killed four people with a 4x4 vehicle and knives before being shot dead outside the Houses of Parliament last week. The official aim will be to build up a comprehensive picture of the man responsible for the most lethal terrorist attack in Britain since 2005, in order to understand how he could have been stopped. Another aim will be simply to understand what turns someone into a terrorist killer.
�쏞learly the main line of our investigation is what led him to be radicalised,�� said Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard�셲 top counter-terrorism officer, on Friday.
Yet even such a seemingly banal objective is problematic. Many experts now question the whole concept of radicalisation. The FBI talks of �쐏athways to violence��, stressing that every individual�셲 journey to extremist murder is unique. There are fierce debates over the role of ideology, social circumstances, individual personality traits, and mental illness. Analysts prefer to talk of �쐒isk factors�� rather than �쐒oot causes��.
But some trends are evident. One is age. Masood, 52, was an outlier. Ten years ago, the average age of attackers in the west was around 29. Now it is nearer 25. In France almost 2,000 teenagers have been radicalised by Islamic State, officials say, with a 121% increase between 2015 and 2016.
One possible reason for this is demographic �� large numbers of adult second-generation immigrants. Another is intensive social media use on now ubiquitous smartphones, and consequent exposure to propaganda. A third is the specific appeal of Isis, which offers adventure, camaraderie, cash rewards and even sexual opportunity in a way that contrasts dramatically with the asceticism of previous militant groups like al-Qaida.
This also helps explain why the proportion of Islamic militants with criminal backgrounds has risen too. Former Isis militants in Europe have described the attraction of the group as like that of a gang �� yet one in which violence and misogyny become transformed into �쐒esistance�� and �쐒edemption�� for erring sinners. The group�셲 debased message, stripped of all but the most simplistic and distorted theological or political argument, appeals too to those who have neither the intellectual equipment nor inclination to debate, argue or learn.
Masood was convicted of a series of violent offences �� the most recent in 2003. He appears to have converted to Islam around then. A disproportionately high number of militants involved in plots in the west have been converts. In the UK between 2001 and 2013, 12% of �쐆omegrown jihadis�� were converts, but less than 4% of the overall Muslim population were. In the US, the total in 2015 was 40%, against an overall level of 23%. Do converts have something to prove? Are they, with superficial cultural and theological knowledge, more vulnerable to extremist interpretations of key teachings and texts?
Then there is identity. Masood, born Adrian Russell Elms, grew up one of two black men in a village in Kent, son of a single teenage white mother. Much of his life appears to have been marked by racial tensions. This too may help explain the appeal of not just conversion to Islam, but of extremism.
As early as 2008, French security services were stressing �쐓plit identities�� as a key factor behind extremism. Isis has made efforts to project its so-called caliphate as blind to colour, ethnicity and nationality �� in deliberate opposition to the discrimination it claims exists in the west. Isis followers have focused social media activity on incidents of racial violence or injustice in the west. �쏧 am not British or Indian but a Muslim,�� said one British teacher, son of south Asian-born parents, shortly before his death fighting with Islamic militants in Syria in 2015.
Masood does not appear to have tried to leave the UK to fight for the cause at any stage. But from 2004 to 2009 he seems to have been in Saudi Arabia, teaching English. A trip to the Islamic world is another common feature of the background of extremist attackers. Most spend a few months studying, rather than teaching, Islam and Arabic. Many, probably including Masood, are simply steeped in the more rigorous, intolerant and puritanical strains of the faith which, with their limited previous knowledge of Islam, they often do not question. Such strands facilitate, though do not guarantee, a later commitment to more aggressive ideologies. Some are clearly exposed to violent tendencies in establishments linked to extremists.
One factor that has emerged from recent research and reporting of extremist violence is the role of peers, associates and the family. Terrorism is a social activity, not one undertaken by crazed loners. Research last year found that 45% of Islamic militant cases talked about their inspiration and possible actions with family and friends.
Brothers are often involved �� in Paris in November 2015, and Boston in 2013. A married couple launched an attack together in California. Close friends team up �� such as the pair of converts who killed off-duty soldier Lee Rigby in London four years ago. A 2009 FBI study found an average of three, and as many as 14, �쐀ystanders�� in every attack. These were people who knew what was likely to happen but failed to stop it. Most were relatives or friends. Police investigating the Westminster attack will be aiming to find such �쐀ystanders��.
Finally there is the speed at which the �쐏athway to violence�� is travelled. British officials have spoken of �쐄ast turnaround�� radicalisation. Many experts are dubious. But fast or slow, few of those who end up as extremists wake up one day and decide they want to be Isis killers. The process is gradual, if sometimes rapid. Didar Mohammed, a would-be suicide bomber in Kurdistan, told me of �쐗aking up from a nightmare�� when he failed to trip his bomb. A 19-year-old Belgian Isis recruit who at the last moment escaped travelling to Syria, described how she �쐗as no longer herself��. Again and again, former militants describe how they barely imagined their eventual destination when their journey to violence began.
This is important. When on Monday or Tuesday Masood hired the vehicle he used for the attack, had he made up his mind days, or weeks or months before? Could the humiliation of having to give up a family home have been the final element that tipped him into action? What was he saying on WhatsApp, the messaging service, minutes before he launched his attack? And to whom?
It is human nature to try to construct stories, to simplify chaos into linear narratives which provide answers, solutions, explanations. This is what the search for the key to Masood�셲 radicalisation hopes to find. But we know that we do not experience our own lives in this way. Masood, for all his violent tendencies and criminality was, like most murderers, an ordinary man. We will have some answers to our questions. But anyone hoping to definitively resolve the puzzle of how a 52-year-old from Kent came to kill and be killed in the centre of our capital city will be disappointed.
The mother of a murdered British backpacker has accused Donald Trump of using �쐄ake news�� about her daughter�셲 death to further the �쐏ersecution of innocent people�� by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack.
Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, and Tom Jackson, 30, were killed in a knife attack at a hostel in Queensland, Australia, last August. Smail Ayad, 29, from France, has been charged with their murder.
On Monday the White House released a list of 78 attacks that it described as �쐃xecuted or inspired by�� Islamic State to support a claim by Trump that the media has been under-reporting terrorist atrocities.
The list, which was designed to bolster the case for Trump�셲 ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, included the killings of Ayliffe-Chung and Jackson.
In a defiant open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe pointed out that police discounted the possibility that the attack was terrorism related despite reports that the attacker shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� during the stabbing.
�쏮y daughter�셲 death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,�� she wrote.
She told the Guardian that since the White House published the list, Ray Rohweder, a police chief in Queensland responsible for investigating case, had emailed her to repeat that there was �쐍o terror link�� in her daughter�셲 death.
�쏧t�셲 the police who say it wasn�셳 a terror attack. That�셲 good enough for me and it should be good enough for Trump,�� she said.
She added: �쏦e [Trump] is trying to justify his actions in not allowing Muslims into the country from these seven countries. He�셲 trying to find examples of terror and this just isn�셳 one of them.
�쏧t does look like fake news. It�셲 another example of some conniving unpleasant politicking. He [Trump] is using it in a quite pernicious way to justify unfair practices and discrimination against people I find personally we have a lot to learn from.��
The email from Rohweder said: �쏷he crimes were not about race or religion, but individual criminal behaviour. I am so sorry that your terrible loss has become the subject of further comment.��
Ayliffe, from Cromford in Derbyshire, has repeatedly challenged what she says is the myth of a connection between her daughter�셲 death and Islamic fundamentalism. She suggested that Mia�셲 funeral should include a reading from the Qur�셙n to help discount the myth.
Ayliffe, who wrote The Rough Guide to Turkey travel book, said: �쏧�셶e lived and worked in Muslim countries. And I was perfectly happy for my daughter to travel in a Muslim country. She wasn�셳 killed in a Muslim country. She was killed in a Christian country, by a French national. It was not a racist, or a terror attack.��
She added: �쏷rump hasn�셳 just got Mia�셲 death wrong. He�셲 got everything wrong regarding Islam and immigration. What he really needs to do is visit some of these countries and learn about their cultures.��
In her letter to Trump, she wrote: �쏷he circumstances of Mia and Tom�셲 deaths prove that those with the strength of character to travel the world and learn about other cultures should be cherished as brave, resilient characters who have so much to offer if they are nurtured and give opportunities rather than defeated by adverse circumstances.��
She said of Trump�셲 travel ban: �쏷his vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred.��
Last month, outgoing pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson gave a speech at the Oxford Union and said that the War on Terror must, at some point, come to an end:
"Now that efforts by the US military against al-Qaida are in their 12th year, we must also ask ourselves: How will this conflict end? . . . . 'War' must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs. We must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the 'new normal.' Peace must be regarded as the norm toward which the human race continually strives. . . . "There will come a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaida and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, that al-Qaida will be effectively destroyed."
On Thursday night, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow interviewed Johnson, and before doing so, she opined as follows:
It is precisely the intrinsic endlessness of this so-called "war" that is its most corrupting and menacing attribute, for the reasons Maddow explained. But despite the happy talk from Johnson, it is not ending soon. By its very terms, it cannot. And all one has to do is look at the words and actions of the Obama administration to know this.
In October, the Washington Post's Greg Miller reported that the administration was instituting a "disposition matrix" to determine how terrorism suspects will be disposed of, all based on this fact: "among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade." As Miller puts it: "That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism."
The polices adopted by the Obama administration just over the last couple of years leave no doubt that they are accelerating, not winding down, the war apparatus that has been relentlessly strengthened over the last decade. In the name of the War on Terror, the current president has diluted decades-old Miranda warnings; codified a new scheme of indefinite detention on US soil; plotted to relocate Guantanamo to Illinois; increased secrecy, repression and release-restrictions at the camp; minted a new theory of presidential assassination powers even for US citizens; renewed the Bush/Cheney warrantless eavesdropping framework for another five years, as well as the Patriot Act, without a single reform; and just signed into law all new restrictions on the release of indefinitely held detainees.
Does that sound to you like a government anticipating the end of the War on Terror any time soon? Or does it sound like one working feverishly to make their terrorism-justified powers of detention, surveillance, killing and secrecy permanent? About all of this, the ACLU's Executive Director, Anthony Romero, provided the answer on Thursday: "President Obama has utterly failed the first test of his second term, even before inauguration day. His signature means indefinite detention without charge or trial, as well as the illegal military commissions, will be extended."
There's a good reason US officials are assuming the "War on Terror" will persist indefinitely: namely, their actions ensure that this occurs. The New York Times' Matthew Rosenberg this morning examines what the US government seems to regard as the strange phenomenon of Afghan soldiers attacking US troops with increasing frequency, and in doing so, discovers a shocking reality: people end up disliking those who occupy and bomb their country:
"Such insider attacks, by Afghan security forces on their Western allies, became 'the signature violence of 2012', in the words of one former American official. The surge in attacks has provided the clearest sign yet that Afghan resentment of foreigners is becoming unmanageable, and American officials have expressed worries about its disruptive effects on the training mission that is the core of the American withdrawal plan for 2014. . . . "But behind it all, many senior coalition and Afghan officials are now concluding that after nearly 12 years of war, the view of foreigners held by many Afghans has come to mirror that of the Taliban. Hope has turned into hatred, and some will find a reason to act on those feelings. "'A great percentage of the insider attacks have the enemy narrative �� the narrative that the infidels have to be driven out �� somewhere inside of them, but they aren't directed by the enemy,' said a senior coalition officer, who asked not to be identified because of Afghan and American sensitivities about the attacks."
In other words, more than a decade of occupying and brutalizing that country has turned large swaths of the population into the "Taliban", to the extent that the "Taliban" means: Afghans willing to use violence to force the US and its allies out of their country. As always, the US - through the very policies of aggression and militarism justified in the name of terrorism - is creating the very "terrorists" those polices are supposedly designed to combat. It's a pure and perfect system of self-perpetuation.
Exactly the same thing is happening in Yemen, where nothing is more effective at driving Yemenis into the arms of al-Qaida than the rapidly escalated drone attacks under Obama. This morning, the Times reported that US air strikes in Yemen are carried out in close cooperation with the air force of Saudi Arabia, which will only exacerbate that problem. Indeed, virtually every person accused of plotting to target the US with terrorist attacks in last several years has expressly cited increasing US violence, aggression and militarism in the Muslim world as the cause.
There's no question that this "war" will continue indefinitely. There is no question that US actions are the cause of that, the gasoline that fuels the fire. The only question - and it's becoming less of a question for me all the time - is whether this endless war is the intended result of US actions or just an unwanted miscalculation.
It's increasingly hard to make the case that it's the latter. The US has long known, and its own studies have emphatically concluded, that "terrorism" is motivated not by a "hatred of our freedoms" but by US policy and aggression in the Muslim world. This causal connection is not news to the US government. Despite this - or, more accurately, because of it - they continue with these policies.
One of the most difficult endeavors is to divine the motives of other people (divining our own motives is difficult enough). That becomes even more difficult when attempting to discern the motives not of a single actor but a collection of individuals with different motives and interests ("the US government").
But what one can say for certain is that there is zero reason for US officials to want an end to the war on terror, and numerous and significant reasons why they would want it to continue. It's always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war. Cicero, two thousand years ago, warned that "In times of war, the law falls silent" (Inter arma enim silent leges). John Jay, in Federalist No. 4, warned that as a result of that truth, "nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it . . . for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans."
If you were a US leader, or an official of the National Security State, or a beneficiary of the private military and surveillance industries, why would you possibly want the war on terror to end? That would be the worst thing that could happen. It's that war that generates limitless power, impenetrable secrecy, an unquestioning citizenry, and massive profit.
Just this week, a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration need not respond to the New York Times and the ACLU's mere request to disclose the government's legal rationale for why the President believes he can target US citizens for assassination without due process. Even while recognizing how perverse her own ruling was - "The Alice-in-Wonderland nature of this pronouncement is not lost on me" and it imposes "a veritable Catch-22" - the federal judge nonetheless explained that federal courts have constructed such a protective shield around the US government in the name of terrorism that it amounts to an unfettered license to violate even the most basic rights: "I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret" (emphasis added).
Why would anyone in the US government or its owners have any interest in putting an end to this sham bonanza of power and profit called "the war on terror"? Johnson is right that there must be an end to this war imminently, and Maddow is right that the failure to do so will render all the due-process-free and lawless killing and imprisoning and invading and bombing morally indefensible and historically unforgivable.
But the notion that the US government is even entertaining putting an end to any of this is a pipe dream, and the belief that they even want to is fantasy. They're preparing for more endless war; their actions are fueling that war; and they continue to reap untold benefits from its continuation. Only outside compulsion, from citizens, can make an end to all of this possible.
A 29-year-old woman has been charged over a failed jihadist attack near Paris�셲 Notre Dame cathedral as French politicians continue to argue about how to deal with the country�셲 severe terror threat.
The woman, named as Ornella G, was linked to a women�셲 terror �쐁ommando�� that the Paris prosecutor said was guided by Islamic State from Syria. Several women have been arrested in France in recent days as police believed a cell was about to attack Paris�셲 Gare de Lyon station, days after trying to blow up a car near Notre Dame.
The commando �� including a 23-year-old woman who had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out attacks this summer �� illustrated how extensive new terror cells have been able to form in France since the November attacks that killed 130 in Paris last year. A 15-year-old boy was also arrested and questioned at the weekend over links to the failed plot.
The boy had been under house arrest since France declared a state of emergency after the Paris attacks, two judicial sources said on condition of anonymity. They did not say why he was under house arrest. His arrest on Saturday came as he was planning an attack in a public place in the French capital, one of the sources said.
The prime minister, Manuel Valls, said on Sunday that the current terror threat in France was at �쐌aximum�� and that at least two terror attacks had been thwarted in the past week.
In a country that has seen more than 230 people die in terrorist attacks since January 2015, Valls said: �쏷here will be more attacks. There will be innocent victims. Each time I say those words, because it�셲 my role, I realise the importance and gravity of it.��
He said 700 French jihadis were currently fighting with Isis in Syria, including more than 200 women. French security services were also watching 15,000 people for radicalisation. He rejected repeated calls by the rightwing former president Nicolas Sarkozy for a type of internment in which people suspected of showing signs of radicalisation would be put in special detention centres.
Valls said Sarkozy was wrong to try to �쐓trangle the state of law��. Despite a serious overcrowding problem already facing French prisons, Valls said that 10,000 new prison places had to be created in the next 10 years for isolation cells and dedicated units for radicalised prisoners.
Ornella G�셲 fingerprints were found in a Peugeot 607 car that was abandoned last Sunday a few hundred metres from Notre Dame in an area thronging with tourists. The car contained five gas cylinders, three bottles of diesel and a lit cigarette. Two women are suspected of attempting to blow up the car before fleeing when they saw a man they believed to be a plainclothes police officer.
Ornella G, who has three children, had been previously known to authorities for wanting to go to Syria to join jihadis. Her lawyer told French media that she had confessed to investigators. The French paper Le Journal du Dimanche reported that she had told investigators that she and another woman had driven around Paris in the early hours of last Sunday morning, initially considering blowing up the car near the Eiffel Tower.
She has been charged with association with a terrorist group and attempted murder by an organised group. She was arrested at a service station in southern France as she attempted to flee south with her children and former partner.
Ines Madani, 19, who is also suspected of taking part in the failed Notre Dame attack, continued to be questioned on Sunday. She was arrested on Thursday in a town south-east of Paris with two other women as they prepared to carry out what officials called another �쐇mminent attack�� on a railway station, probably Paris�셲 Gare de Lyon. In her handbag, she had a written statement of allegiance to Isis.
Another of the women arrested, referred to as Sarah H, aged 23, had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out deadly attacks earlier this year. One of them was Larossi Abballa, who murdered a police commander and his police officer partner in June at their home in Magnanville outside Paris in the presence of their three-year-old son. He filmed the aftermath on Facebook Live before dying in a police raid. The other was Adel Kermiche, who slit the throat of an elderly French priest during morning mass in Normandy in July.
Donald Trump has criticised the mayor of London, hours after seven people were killed and 48 injured in a terror attack in the centre of the city.
�쏛t least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack,�� the president wrote on his personal Twitter account, �쏿nd Mayor of London says there is �쁭o reason to be alarmed!�쇺��
In response, a spokesman for Sadiq Khan said the mayor had �쐌ore important things to do than respond to Donald Trump�셲 ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks��.
Khan commented on the attacks in a statement overnight and in a television interview earlier on Sunday. In the interview, he said there was �쐍o reason to be alarmed�� by an increased and armed police presence in the city that day.
In his statement on Saturday night, issued as the London Bridge attack unfolded, Khan said: �쏮etropolitan police are responding to the horrific terrorist attack at London Bridge and Borough Market.�� He added: �쏮y thoughts are with everyone affected, and I�셝 like to thank the brave men and women of our emergency services who were first on the scene and will be working throughout the night.
�쏷his was a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night,�� he said. �쏧 condemn it in the strongest possible terms. There is no justification whatsoever for such barbaric acts.��
In the television interview on Sunday morning, Khan said the UK general election, scheduled for Thursday, should go ahead as planned. He added: �쏷here aren�셳 words to describe the grief and anger that our city will be facing today. I�셫 appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners.
�쏷here can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists and I am quite clear that we will never let them win.
�쏮y message to Londoners and visitors to our great city is to be calm and vigilant today. You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world. You saw last night as a consequence of our planning, our preparation, the rehearsals that take place, the swift response from the emergency services tackling the terrorists and also helping the injured.��
After Trump�셲 tweet, a spokesperson for Khan said: �쏷he mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city.
�쏦e has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump�셲 ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police �� including armed officers �� on the streets.��
In another tweet, Trump wrote: �쏡o you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That�셲 because they used knives and a truck!��
He added: �쏻e must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don�셳 get smart it will only get worse.��
Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who is a member of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN the president�셲 words �쐔roubled�� him. Former vice-president Al Gore told the same network: �쏧 don�셳 think a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticise a mayor who�셲 trying to organise his city�셲 response.��
In London, acting US ambassador Lewis Lukens issued a pointed statement: �쏧 commend the strong leadership of [Sadiq Khan] as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack.��
Hillary Clinton also put out a statement sharply contrasting Trump�셲 tone.
Trump was also widely criticised for his first reaction to the news from London, in which he retweeted an unsubstantiated headline from the conservative Drudge Report website and then said: �쏻e need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!��
The White House this week asked the supreme court to reinstate its bar on entry from six Muslim-majority countries. The measure has been blocked repeatedly by lower courts.
Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a western European capital city, has attracted ire from the Trump family before. In March, hours after an attack at Westminster Bridge in which five people died, Trump�셲 oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted: �쏽ou have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan.��
Trump Jr was criticised for taking those words out of context: speaking six months before the Westminster attack, Khan had also discussed the necessity of providing strong security for Londoners.
�� This article was amended on 4, 5 and 6 June 2017 to accurately reflect the timing of Sadiq Khan�셲 comments, and because an earlier version said Khan was the first Muslim mayor of a major European city. This has been corrected to say of a western European capital city.
The facts about what Thomas Mair did are beyond shocking, beyond dispute, and so hard for us to comprehend that we seek a suitable vocabulary. He was convicted by a criminal court and given a whole-life sentence. So does that make him merely a criminal of our worst imagination? Or does it go further than that? Can he reasonably be described as a terrorist?
Jo Cox�셲 bereaved and resolutely dignified partner, Brendan, gave us a clear view into his thinking. This, he said, was a political act �� an �쐇ncompetent and self-defeating�� act of terrorism. Not because the attack itself was not meticulously executed (it clearly was) but because it had wider and deeper aims: aims that Brendan Cox believed the attacker had failed to fulfil. Instead of engineering hate, Cox said, Mair had triggered an outpouring of love and solidarity.
The Oxford Dictionaries definition of a terrorist is: �쏛 person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.�� That clearly describes Mair and his modus operandi.
As he struck the fatal blows, he made clear that his was not solely an attack on Cox as an individual: �쏷his is for Britain,�� he said, and �쏫eep Britain independent,�� reloading his gun. His first court appearance, where he gave his name as �쏡eath to traitors, freedom for Britain��, confirmed that wider motivation.
Even a mind as warped as Mair�셲 cannot have believed that the slaying of one MP would achieve his desired aim. It was an attack on a public representative with the intention of terrorising all that she and others like her represented.
She was the blameless victim, but the target was a philosophy.
That Mair, as an avowed neo-Nazi, was apparently working alone without any obvious association with a group, does not detract from the fact that his aims were terrorist aims and the template employed was that of the terrorist.
After the verdict, Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said her officials had no doubt as to how Mair might best be classified. �쏮otivated by hate, his premeditated crimes were nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology,�� she said.
Hemming and her team had the option of prosecuting Mair under anti-terrorism legislation. They chose not to do so, not because he fell outside the definition but because the charges were framed in such a way as to make his motivation irrelevant.
For all that, the killing of Jo Cox was recognised at the time, by parliamentarians and the public at large �� at home and abroad �� for what it was: an attempt to leverage an isolated act of violence so as to achieve a magnified intimidatory and political effect. Terrorists have been doing that for years.
It has become a cliche question among race-rights campaigners (with whom I have common cause): �쏻hy aren�셳 far-right crimes considered terrorism?�� Such a common question that now, it seems, the police are changing tack and labelling Thomas Mair a terrorist (though not so much that they actually charged him with terrorism offences).
It�셲 certainly true that a narrow definition of terrorism as a �쐏olitical act�� would include Mair. But whatever one particular dictionary might say, there is no widely agreed definition of terrorism.
And while I don�셳 doubt that Mair�셲 motives were political, in the common understanding and usage of the term �쐔errorism��, more than this is required. Because, though he had far-right sympathies, it�셲 clear his actions weren�셳 supporting anyone�셲 agenda but his own.
To my knowledge there is no organisation that calls for the violent overthrow of the state, or for the killing of leftwing MPs. And though some eyewitnesses reported Mair shouting �쏝ritain first�� during his attack on Jo Cox, there�셲 no evidence he was acting for, or under the instruction of, the legal rightwing organisation of the same name.
In fact, the commonly held perception is that a criminal has to be acting on behalf of a wider organisation to be considered a terrorist. So, for example, even though there have been several �쐋one wolf�� attacks by jihadi extremists in the UK and beyond, they are carrying out the agenda of Islamic State, or al-Qaida, and part of a wider bloody struggle. These terror groups gain power because every attack carries the specific and sharpened threat of further violence from another sympathiser.
Mair�셲 guidance came from inside his head. His was a shocking hate crime against a dedicated young woman who was trying to make the world a better place, but it�셲 not surprising that this wasn�셳 widely considered a terror attack amid all the reporting at the time.
And if we�셱e to consider all �쐏olitical acts�� terrorism, then where do we stop? Was the Yorkshire Ripper, who wanted to rid the world of sex workers, a terrorist? What about Robert Ashman, the man who in 2000 killed Andrew Pennington, an aide to the Lib Dem MP Nigel Jones? Lee Harvey Oswald shot a president but has rarely, if ever, been called a terrorist.
By overusing the label we merely dilute our sense of the evil that lies behind those groups and networks that coolly and calculatingly conspire to bring about wide-scale slaughter.
And, to my fellow race equality campaigners: I�셫 not, of course, saying that far-right crimes cannot be considered terrorism. Groups such as Combat 18 have carried out acts of violence and harassment against Britain�셲 ethnic minorities since the 1970s. And the historic campaign of lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan makes it, in my view, a terrorist organisation. The KKK is, however, still legal in the United States, and its favoured candidate is about to move into the White House. It may take some time before this group is officially given the status it deserves.
Donald Trump appears to invent a terrorist attack in Sweden during a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday. Trump uses his speech to talk about migration in Europe and links it to terror attacks in Brussels, Nice and Paris. He then adds Sweden to the list, incorrectly stating that an attack had happened there on Friday
The terror threat level in the UK has been reduced from critical to severe and soldiers deployed to key sites around the country will begin to be withdrawn from Monday, Theresa May has said.
The prime minister said Operation Temperer, in which military personnel were deployed to bolster security in the wake of the Manchester bombing, would be scaled back after the bank holiday weekend.
Security officials had advised the government to raise the terror threat to critical, which means they believe an attack is imminent, after a suicide bomber killed 22 people, including children, at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday. Additional resources were deployed to help with the investigation into the attack and provide greater security at a host of weekend events. It is normal for a critical terror threat level to be maintained for just a few days.
May said: �쏷he public should be clear about what this means. A threat level of severe means an attack remains highly likely. The country should remain vigilant.�� Speaking after a meeting of the government�셲 Cobra emergency committee on Saturday, she said the decision had been taken after �쏿 significant amount of police activity�� over the last 24 hours.
The Manchester bombing was the worst terror attack to hit Britain since the 7 July attacks in London in 2005.
On Saturday a street in Manchester�셲 Moss Side was evacuated by counter-terrorism officers and controlled explosives were used in a raid on a property in Cheetham Hill.
Bomb disposal experts from the Royal Logistics Corps entered a property on Boscombe Street, on the Moss Side/Rushlome border, near the site of Manchester City�셲 Maine Road stadium used to be. Residents from neighbouring properties were evacuated, with others told not to leave their homes for several hours.
An address on Boscombe Street was being searched by detectives throughout Saturday as they sought to close the net on the suspected terror cell behind Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi.
Skiren Khan, 25, lives a few doors down and said she saw two men being put into a police van around 9am. Sunil Magnani, who runs a corner shop nearby, said two men were taken away by police from the terraced house. �쏰ne of my customers told me two guys were taken away, one Arab and one black guy,�� said the shopkeeper.
Two men aged 20 and 22 were arrested in the early hours of Saturday morning at the Cheetham Hill address, police said. Neighbours identified Yahya and Mohamed Werfalli, aged 20 and 22, as two of the occupants of the raided house. They were said to be of Libyan descent and part of the same friendship groups as the Manchester bomber.
Police have not confirmed the identities of any of those arrested in connection with the investigation. Eleven people remain in custody.
On Saturday afternoon, Britain�셲 top counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, said officers had carried out 17 searches, mostly in the north-west. He told reporters: �쏻e are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the bomb. There is still much more to do. There will be more arrests. There will be more searches, but the greater clarity and progress has led JTAC, the independent body which assesses threat, to the judgment that an attack is no longer imminent.��
The threat level was raised on Tuesday over fears that the network linked to Abedi was at large, possibly with access to further explosives and intent on attacking again.
The decision to drop the threat level down one grade to severe means intelligence analysts are satisfied that risk is now under sufficient control.
On Friday, Rowley said: �쏻e have already got a large part of the network, including some very significant arrests and some significant finds. Clearly, we haven�셳 covered all the territory we want to, but we have covered a large part of it, so our confidence has been increasing in recent days. But there�셲 still more to do to get the degree of confidence we want.��
By Saturday morning, analysts at the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which sets the threat level, were satisfied the danger posed by the network linked to the Manchester bomber had lessened through arrests and also after examination of materials seized after a string on raids starting on Tuesday.
There is still concern among counter-terrorism officials about the network linked to Abedi, the Guardian understands, but JTAC believes this is insufficient to state that an attack may be imminent.
Although the threat level has been scaled back, Rowley said there would still be a heightened security presence at events over the bank holiday weekend. In a statement on Saturday afternoon, he said: �쏤or practical reasons and precautionary reasons, we made the decision that the resources that we had planned for this weekends events will continue. They will still see that high level of policing presence �� some armed, some unarmed.��
But he added that after the bank holiday the range of additional resources deployed in the wake of the Manchester attack would be stepped down. He added that military support would also be phased out in the coming days.
The threat level of severe means an attack is highly likely. The two months since 22 March, when five people including the attacker died in an attack on Westminster, have seen a particularly high level of activity by terrorists.
A total of seven plots are publicly known about: the attacks on Westminster and Manchester, and five more that were disrupted and arrests made; four in London, one in Birmingham.
The deadly attacks in Brussels, which Isis has now claimed responsibility for, will have left many individuals in Belgium and elsewhere feeling frightened about a rise in terrorist incidents in Europe. Understanding whether those fears are justified, however, is incredibly difficult.
According to the Global Terrorism Database, three terrorist incidents were reported in Belgium between 2011 and 2014. Finding more recent (or, for that matter, older) data about the frequency of terror attacks is very hard to do, however, since these databases use a flawed methodology.
The Global Terrorism Database is as good a source as any, though. Located at the University of Maryland, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (AKA Start) was established in 2005 as a US Department of Homeland Security center of excellence. Start�셲 database covers the period between 1970 and 2014 and has information on more than 140,000 reported terrorist attacks.
In theory, that should make it easy to track how often terrorist incidents occur and where they are most likely to take place. However, the Global Terrorism Database draws on news sources (as well as existing datasets, books and legal documents) to track terrorist incidents. That makes things difficult: often media sources disagree about the location of an attack, the motives of the attackers and the number of casualties. Although researchers will try to weigh the evidence and select the information that seems most accurate, it�셲 still a judgment call.
It�셲 also problematic when media reports do agree �� that can sometimes mean there are duplicated terrorist incidents in the database. And the overall rise in the volume of media reports over time can exaggerate the rise in terrorist incidents. I discovered this myself when using GDELT, an alternative database, to track kidnappings in Nigeria; my analysis was flawed because it couldn�셳 differentiate between a rise in terrorism and a rise in reporting.
Therefore it�셲 unwise to draw conclusions about whether terrorist attacks are becoming more common �� but it is possible to take a glimpse at geographical patterns. That too should come with a substantial caveat, since the media are no doubt more inclined to cover incidents in certain countries. But there are nonetheless some differences so large that they reveal trends even after accounting for those caveats (and population size too).
Below are the 10 countries with the highest number of terrorist incidents reported by the media between 2011 and 2014. Countries in western Europe do not appear here. The United Kingdom is the only country in Europe to appear remotely close to the top in fact: with 338 reported incidents, it sits in 19th place. Of those, 288 occurred in Northern Ireland.
Over the same time period, 57 terrorist incidents were reported in the United States �� approximately 0.02 for every 100,000 residents.
A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.
She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.
The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.
The accused was aged just 16 when she �쐌arried�� the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.
During Wednesday�셲 short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.
Deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.
In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having �쐔he intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention��.
The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: �쐇. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.��
Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: �쏶ix attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.��
Britain�셲 top police officer added: �쏷he bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.��
The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely. Three such attacks have claimed lives in Britain since 22 March.
�� This article was amended on 23 August 2017 to correct the job title of judge Tan Ikram, who is a deputy senior district judge.
Counter-terror police have arrested three men in Sheffield and Huddersfield following raids across Yorkshire.
Two men, aged 24 and 29, were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of terrorism offences. The raids were not linked to the investigation into the Manchester Arena bombing.
Residents living near the raided homes, including flats in the Kelham Island area of Sheffield and a house in the Crosland Moor area of Huddersfield, reported loud bangs and scores of armed police entering the properties.
A third man, aged 23, from Sheffield, was arrested on Friday morning on suspicion of assisting an offender.
A statement from the north east counter-terrorism unit said: �쏝oth property searches have now concluded and we would like to thank the local communities for their patience and understanding.��
Police said: �쏷here are no connections to the recent incident and investigation in Manchester. The operation is based on recently received intelligence. We understand that people may have concerns as a result of this activity and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of the public while these inquiries are carried out.��
The CTU moved to reassure the public, saying the loud noises were part of police operations to gain entry to addresses.
People living around a block of flats between Dun Street and Cornish Street, close to Sheffield�셲 Inner Ring Road, reported hearing a bang at about 5.30pm on Thursday. One man who lived in the block said he saw a second-floor flat�셲 door had been blown off.Others said they saw armed plain-clothed officers in the triangular courtyard in the centre of the modern block.The flats are fairly new, a short walk from the city centre, in an area that has changed in recent years from a site of derelict 19th-century industrial buildings to a series of residential flats redevelopments.On Thursday night, cordons on the streets surrounding the property were lifted, although a number of police officers continued to guard the block, which is opposite the Shalesmoor tram stop, as searches continued.Similar scenes were reported in Huddersfield, where a large number of armed police were deployed in the Ellison Street area of the town.
Pakistan's powerful intelligence services were heavily involved in preparations for the Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008, according to classified Indian government documents obtained by the Guardian.
A 109-page report into the interrogation of key suspect David Headley, a Pakistani-American militant arrested last year and detained in the US, makes detailed claims of ISI support for the bombings.
Under questioning, Headley described dozens of meetings between officers of the main Pakistani military intelligence service, the ISI, and senior militants from the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
He claims a key motivation for the ISI in aiding the attacks was to bolster militant organisations with strong links to the Pakistani state and security establishment who were being marginalised by more extreme radical groups.
Headley, who undertook surveillance of the targets in Mumbai for the operation, claims that at least two of his missions were partly paid for by the ISI and that he regularly reported to the spy agency. However, the documents suggest that supervision of the militants by the ISI was often chaotic and that the most senior officers of the agency may have been unaware at least of the scale and ambition of the operation before it was launched.
More than 160 people were killed by militants from LeT who arrived by sea to attack luxury hotels, a Jewish centre, a caf챕, a hospital and the main railway station in Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital. Casualties included citizens from 25 countries, including four Americans killed and seven Britons injured. The attacks dominated media for days and badly damaged already poor Indian-Pakistan relations.
European and American security services now fear that LeT, which has thousands of militants, runs dozens of training camps and has extensive logistic networks overseas, is moving from what has been a largely regional agenda �� focused on the disputed Himalayan former princely state of Kashmir �� to a global agenda involving strikes against the west or western interests. The documents suggest the fierce internal argument within the organisation over its strategic direction is being won by hardliners.
Headley, interviewed over 34 hours by Indian investigators in America in June, described how "a debate had begun among the terrorist outfits" and "a clash of ideology" leading to "splits".
"The aggression and commitment to jihad shown by several splinter groups in Afghanistan influenced many committed fighters to leave [LeT]," Headley said. "I understand this compelled the LeT to consider a spectacular terrorist strike in India."
Headley, who changed his name from Daood Gilani, told the investigators that the ISI hoped the Mumbai attack would slow or stop growing "integration" between groups active in Kashmir, with whom the agency had maintained a long relationship, and "Taliban-based outfits" in Pakistan and Afghanistan which were a threat to the Pakistani state.
"The ISI �� had no ambiguity in understanding the necessity to strike India," Headley is reported to have said. The aim of the agency was "controlling further split in the Kashmir-based outfits, providing them a sense of achievement and shifting �� the theatre of violence from the domestic soil of Pakistan to India."
Headley describes meeting once with a "Colonel Kamran" from the military intelligence service and having a series of meetings with a "Major Iqbal" and a "Major Sameer Ali". A fellow conspirator was handled by a Colonel Shah, he claims. Headley also alleges that he was given $25,000 by his ISI handler to finance one of eight surveillance missions in India.
However, Headley describes the ISI director general, Lt General Shuja Pasha, visiting a key senior militant from LeT in prison after the attacks in a bid "to understand" the operation, implying that, as many western security agencies suspect, the top ranks of the agency were unaware of at least the scale of the planned strike.
The Pakistani government has repeatedly denied any involvement of any security official in the Mumbai attacks. Last night, an ISI spokesman told the Guardian the accusations of the agency's involvement in the Mumbai attacks were "baseless".
LeT was banned in Pakistan in 2002. Jamat-ud Dawa, the social welfare wing of LeT, has been blacklisted in the wake of the Mumbai attacks although it continues to function.
The revelations could prove embarrassing to the US government as well as to the Pakistanis. Reports in American newspapers over the weekend claimed that Headley's wife had tried to alert American authorities to her husband's activities but had been ignored.
MPs preparing to vote on whether or not to bomb Isis in Syria would do well to read an article in Foreign Policy magazine, The threat is already inside, and nine other truths about terrorism nobody wants to hear.
Written by Rosa Brooks, a law professor at Georgetown university who has served as an adviser to the US state department, it places the Paris attacks - and all acts of terrorism by Isis - in perspective:
She concedes that �쐏oliticians don�셳 like to say any of this�� and goes on to list nine �쐏ainful truths��. In short form - you need to read Brooks�셲 piece in full - they are:
1: We can�셳 keep the bad guys out. All borders are permeable. There aren�셳 enough guards in the world to monitor every inch of coastline or border
2: Besides, the threat is already inside. The 2005 terrorist attacks in London were carried out by British citizens, the Boston Marathon attack was perpetrated by a US citizen... and the Paris attacks appear to have been carried out mainly by French citizens. Every country on earth has its angry young men.
3: More surveillance won�셳 get rid of terrorism, either. As Edward Snowden�셲 2013 leaks made clear, the United States is already surveilling the heck out of the entire planet and so are half the governments in Europe. The trouble is, the more data you collect �� the more satellite imagery and drone footage and emails and phone calls and texts you monitor �� the harder it gets to separate the signal from the noise.
4: Defeating Isis won�셳 make terrorism go away. Aside from Isis, there is Nigeria�셲 Boko Haram. Before Isis, there was al-Qaida and before that there was Hezbollah and Hamas... and before that there was Abu Nidal, Black September and various other PLO factions. And it�셲 not just Islam. Right-wing extremists in the United States still kill more people than jihadis. The 2011 attack in Norway �� which left 77 people dead �� was carried out by a single far-right terrorist. Since 2006, more than half of all deaths in terrorist attacks in the west have been caused by non-Islamist �쐋one-wolf�� attackers.
5: Terrorism (in the west) remains a relatively minor threat. Between 2000 and 2014, only 2.6% of terrorism victims in recent years lived in western countries.
6: But don�셳 relax too much, because things will probably get worse before they get better. From a historical perspective, the relative safety and security currently enjoyed by those in the western world is anomalous. The history of the west is every bit as violent as the modern Middle East. The world is likely to see an uptick in violent conflict in the coming decades, and the west is unlikely to be fully spared.
7: Meanwhile, poorly planned western actions can make things still worse. The fat, happy, over-privileged west wants to turn away the hundreds of thousands of desperate Muslim families seeking shelter and peace, just because a tiny fraction of those refugees might be militants. Islamic militants couldn�셳 ask for a better recruiting gift. The same goes for stepping up military action against Isis.
8: Terrorism is a problem to be managed. We can�셳 �쐗in�� a �쐗ar�� against terrorism or terror or terrorists any more than we can �쐗in�� a war on crime or drugs or poverty. But we can adopt sensible policies to reduce the risk and damage caused by terrorist attacks, such as funding moderate Muslim organisations. If we�셱e creative in our approaches, we can find ways to make terrorist attacks a little harder to carry out successfully, and make successful attacks less rewarding to those who carry them out.
9: To do this, however, we need to move beyond the political posturing that characterises most public debates about counter-terrorism, and instead speak honestly about the costs and benefits of different approaches.
Brooks concludes by arguing against overreacting to terrorism. �쏻e need to stop viewing terrorism as unique and aberrational. The more we panic and posture and overreact, the more terrorism we�셪l get.��
The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull has led calls for an investigation into why a gunman who held a woman hostage while claiming links to Islamic State had been freed on parole just six months earlier.
Yacqub Khayre, a 29-year-old Somali-born Australian, killed a man before being shot dead by police in a Melbourne suburb on Monday night. He injured three police officers in a shootout in which the hostage was released unharmed. �쏷his is for IS, this is for al-Qaida,�� he reportedly told TV station Channel 7 during the siege.
While conservatives seized on Turnbull�셲 description of the siege as �쏧slamist terrorism�� to call for a new security crackdown and measures to tackle hate preachers, the prime minister demanded the Victorian state government explain whether parole was appropriate for a man with such a lengthy criminal history and who had been previously associated with a foiled terror plot.
The siege unfolded on Monday evening in the beachside suburb of Brighton, about 11km south-east of Melbourne�셲 central business district. At 4pm, police were called to a serviced apartment building in the area after receiving reports of an explosion, and cordoned off surrounding streets.
By 6pm, Khayre emerged from the ground floor apartment where he had been holding an escort hostage �� a 36 year-old Colombian woman unknown to him and who he had arranged to meet him at the complex that afternoon through an agency. He began firing at police who had the building surrounded. Three police officers were injured during the gunfire, and Khayre was killed. His hostage, who remained inside, was uninjured.
The body of the building clerk was found in the reception area of the apartment building, and police said Khayre shot the man dead when he first arrived at the apartment complex. This was likely the cause of the explosion noises reported to police.
The clerk was a 36-year-old Australian national born in China, and was recently married. He has a child. Police could reveal little more about the man as they were still speaking with his family, but Victoria�셲 police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said on Tuesday morning that he was an innocent man caught up in the situation while doing his job.
Police confirmed reports Khayre tampered with his ankle monitor bracelet and are investigating whether he did so in an attempt to lure police to the scene, though said they were already responding to reports of explosions by this stage.
Court documents relating to Khayre�셲 prior crimes detail a troubled childhood. He came to Australia as a child, arriving with his grandparents as refugees from Somalia via a Kenyan refugee camp.
In time, Khayre�셲 parents joined him in Australia, but their relationship was tense, the court heard.
In her sentencing of Khayre in 2012, then aged 24, for a series of charges including aggravated burglary and theft, Melbourne county court judge Felicity Hampel described his parents as �쐁onservative, traditional and strict��.
�쏽our grandfather died towards the end of your secondary schooling and you lost his steadying influence,�� Hampel said. �쏛t about that time, it would appear you had already started dabbling in drugs and alcohol, but following your grandfather�셲 death, you began abusing them seriously.
�쏽ou did not complete your schooling, and the cycle of drug abuse and committing offences commenced then, and has continued until now.��
Khayre served a period of time in the youth justice system as a teenager from 2007 for more than 40 offences including multiple burglaries and theft, giving a false name and address, possession of amphetamines, car theft and driving offences.
Hampel warned that Khayre was becoming isolated from society and sentenced him to five years and six months in prison, with a non-parole period of three years. This parole period was extended due to Khayre�셲 difficult behaviour in prison.
In November, he was released on parole, four-and-a-half years into his sentence.
Between his most recent sentence and his release from the youth justice system, Khayre spent 16 months in a high-security prison charged with terrorism offences related to a 2009 Holsworthy army barracks terror plot in Sydney. He was acquitted of the offences and, upon his release, Khayre�셲 family distanced themselves from him. His drug use continued.
In 2009, Khayre was ordered to take part in a deradicalisation program. By the time of his release from jail in 2016, he was no longer being closely watched by counter-terror police. Police are now investigating whether Khayre may have been radicalised again at some point, or whether the program was effective at all.
Turnbull asked on Tuesday morning: �쏦ow was this man on parole?
�쏦e had a long record of violence. A very long record of violence.
�쏦e had been charged with a terrorist offence some years ago and had been acquitted.
�쏦e was known to have connections, at least in the past, with violent extremism. �쏝ut he was a known, violent offender. How was he on parole?��
But Victoria�셲 premier, Daniel Andrews, said Khayre had adhered to his bail conditions in the six months before his death.
The state�셲 police commissioner Graham Ashton confirmed: �쏦e�셲 been compliant, including drug tests, attending appointments and observing a curfew.��
Victora, he added, had the toughest parole review system anywhere in Australia.
Victoria�셲 opposition leader, Matthew Guy, called on Andrews to resign during a heated parliamentary question time on Tuesday afternoon. He joined Turnbull in questioning parole laws and in asking why Khayre was released.
�쏽ou are weak, and you should resign,�� Guy told Andrews.
In December, the Andrews government introduced a raft of new laws to stop courts from allowing people convicted of serious crimes to serve part of their sentence in the community on parole. The new laws applied for those convicted of the most serious crimes including rape, murder, child sexual abuse and violent offences.
Khayre was granted parole in November and released in December.
��[Doing so] does not keep anyone in our state safe, it is as simple as that, and shame on you,�� Andrews said. He added that parole laws would be scrutinised.
Islamic State propaganda agency Amaq claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday morning in an online statement. �쏷he attack in Melbourne, Australia, was carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in response to the call for targeting the subjects of the coalition states,�� the statement read.
But Ashton cautioned against labelling Khayre�셲 actions as part of a plot, saying Isis �쏿lways tend to jump up and claim responsibility every time something happens��.
He said he believed Khayre was acting alone.
Police are now scouring Khayre�셲 home in Melbourne�셲 northern suburbs to find a motivation for the attack and insight into why he chose Brighton as the location.
�쏷here is nothing that we�셶e found thus far that would suggest to us that this was anything that was planned or done in concert with others,�� Ashton said. �쏷here isn�셳 a sort of ongoing threat in relation to any plot or anything around this individual.��
On Tuesday evening the deputy commissioner, Shane Patton, reiterated the comments.
�쏧 want to stress at this stage the community should feel reassured we aren�셳 looking for any other people,�� Patton said, but he added that security would be increased for sporting and public events occurring over the Queen�셲 birthday long weekend, which Victoria recognises on Monday 12 June. No threats to any venues had been made, he said.
Of the three police officers injured during the siege, one was treated at the scene, while two remain in hospital. Both were stable, with one requiring surgery for wounds to his face, and the other requiring surgery and skin grafts to his hand, Patton said.
He vehemently rejected a suggestion the counter-terrorism arm of Victoria police had made a �쐌istake�� for not watching Khayre more closely upon his jail release. He praised the counter-terrorism unit, saying police were working on the investigation with Australian federal police.
Patton added that police should be praised for foiling a number of terror plots in Melbourne. In 2015 police made arrests relating to an alleged terror attack being planned for Anzac Day remembrance events. In May that same year, they arrested a 17-year-old from Melbourne who was later found guilty of planning a terrorist attack on Mother�셲 Day.
In December, police arrested a number of men in raids across Melbourne allegedly planning a Christmas Day terror attack.
�쏷hey showed great courage last night in the way they quickly attended to an issue,�� he said.
�쏻hen they were confronted, they were decisive, they were swift when confronted by a terrorist armed with a firearm.��
What public purpose is served by the prime minister declaring she has raised Britain�셲 �쐔hreat level�� to �쐁ritical��? Before she thought another terrorist attack was �쐆ighly likely��. It is now �쐃xpected immediately��.
What are we supposed to do with this혻information, other than feel vaguely혻alarmed? The words can have meaning only in the wartime sense, of ordering us to put on gas masks and head for bunkers. Do we alter our journeys to work? Do we put on body armour? Do혻we keep away from crowded places? As for sending in the army �� terrorism�셲 propaganda coup �� what good does that혻do? It supposedly releases the police, but to do what?
For the past 48 hours we have witnessed the impressive calmness of the people of Manchester. They have not shown anger or clamoured for revenge, as in more hot-headed societies, just an intense grief over young lives pointlessly lost. Their prayers, candles, poetry and song have been those of a community closing round its bereaved with dignity. The accidental death of anyone for any reason is private agony enough, but when so many are involved,혻it is right for public figures to express a more distant sympathy.
Sympathy is quite different from aggressive language and bombastic response. We can agree with Theresa May that the Manchester attack was sickening, callous, warped, twisted, even cowardly, and the other adjectives with which she deluged it on Tuesday. We might wonder if she stopped for a moment to ponder the wisdom of turning personal tragedy into such purposeful aggression, knowing it would be greeted with glee by terrorism�셲 supporters. A similar rush to rhetoric on May�셲 part led to a severe over-reaction to the Westminster deaths in March.
Open societies have no defence against suicide bombers. Counter-terrorism manuals assert this, over and again. The conduct of public security �� such as swamping places with police, closing streets and searching bags �� merely redirects the determined bomber elsewhere. Terror bombing is the one foolproof weapon of the weak against the strong. We cannot screen every public space or search every pedestrian. There is nothing new to this.혻The car bomb and the terror grenade are as old as Conrad�셲 secret agent, and his �쐏estilence�� which stalks the street with혻death in its pocket.
All we can hope to do is enter into the혻minds of the bombers and their associates to prevent them at source. That is essentially a covert activity, and is clearly in its infancy. We can try to clean the pool in which fanaticism swims, the ideological grooming and conditioning. The security services must혻relentlessly infiltrate Islamist networks. That is their job �� they claim to foil a dozen attacks a year �� but publicising it cannot be necessary.
When accused of seeking political capital from terrorist outrages, politicians explain that their job is to �쐃xpress public outrage and show that something is being done��. That is cynical. Mancunians this week expressed grief, not outrage. A leader�셲 job is to allay rather than promote public anxiety. It is to minimise rather than propagate the impact of an incident.
The key text here remains the reaction of New York�셲 mayor Rudy Giuliani on the afternoon of 9/11, when he called on New Yorkers to stay calm, �쐀uy a pizza, take the kids to the park, see a show��. May makes no such statements. She does not even do what most prime ministers were careful to do during the IRA terrorism, which was to treat it as criminal, however heinous, and leave it the home secretary to respond.
May seized the megaphone for herself, and thus inevitably politicised the event. There was murmured talk of states of emergency and of suspended election campaigns. Armed troops were deployed in British cities. Parliament is shut down. Buckingham Palace�셲 guard is not changed. This is a statist response on a par with Tony Blair�셲 deployment of Scimitar tanks to Heathrow in 2003 as a �쐂eterrent to terrorism.�� The sole consequence was an instant, multimillion-pound hit to the tourist industry.
The prime minister yesterday plunged twice into Cobra, ignoring Thatcher�셲 maxim of �쏡eny terror the oxygen of publicity��. She was like David Cameron during last year�셲 Brussels massacre, when he put 10,000 troops �쐎n standby��, assigned 22 helicopters to the capital and donated 짙143m to further counter-terrorism measures. He thus encouraged Donald Trump to his absurd conclusion that Belgium and France, if not the whole of Europe, �쏿re혻literally disintegrating��.
The politics of fear is the oldest sick trick in the book. The idea that tanks, troops and helicopters can deter a suicide bomber in a crowded space is ridiculous. The only people it deters are foreign tourists. It shows the madness that seizes all ministers who descend the murky depths of Cobra. They think they are suddenly Churchill�셲 children.
If another attack occurs, as it always may, who can tell where or when? The perpetrator will have just one aim, to gain publicity for a cause. Bruce Hoffman, in his classic book Inside Terrorism, constantly emphasises the role of �쐏sychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target.�� Terrorism�셲 objective is not just to kill but �쐔o create power where there is none, through the publicity generated by the violence��. Publicity is terror�셲 �쐓econd wave��. Without publicity, terrorism is just dead bodies.
Today�셲 terrorist wants to frighten the enemies of Islam into curbing liberties and oppressing Muslims. That is why a genuinely �쐔ough�� response to Manchester would be opposite of May�셲. It would be to let the city bury its dead in peace, not surrounded by her guns. It혻would plead with Muslim leaders to look to their own. It would beg the media not to play terror�셲 game, by relentlessly publicising its violence and harassing the victims�� families.
Above all, a tough response would point out that terrorism is aimed at our freedom to congregate. It is the price of that freedom. For all its horror, the risk of death from terrorist violence is minimal. True toughness would downplay it, avoid the grandstanding and empty rhetoric, the machismo of soldiers and gunships. It would avoid the easy slither into a bruised and weakened liberty that is now the most menacing threat.
An investigation into the foreign funding and support of jihadi groups that was authorised by David Cameron may never be published, the Home Office has admitted.
The inquiry into revenue streams for extremist groups operating in the UK was commissioned by the former prime minister and is thought to focus on Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly been highlighted by European leaders as a funding source for Islamist jihadis.
The investigation was launched as part of a deal with the Liberal Democrats in exchange for the party supporting the extension of British airstrikes against Islamic State into Syria in December 2015.
Tom Brake, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, has written to the prime minister asking her to confirm that the investigation will not be shelved.
The Observer reported in January last year that the Home Office�셲 extremism analysis unit had been directed by Downing Street to investigate overseas funding of extremist groups in the UK, with findings to be shown to Theresa May, then home secretary, and Cameron.
However, 18 months later, the Home Office confirmed the report had not yet been completed and said it would not necessarily be published, calling the contents �쐖ery sensitive��.
A decision would be taken �쏿fter the election by the next government�� about the future of the investigation, a Home Office spokesman said.
In his letter to May, Brake wrote: �쏛s home secretary at the time, your department was one of those leading on the report. Eighteen months later, and following two horrific terrorist attacks by British-born citizens, that report still remains incomplete and unpublished.
�쏧t is no secret that Saudi Arabia in particular provides funding to hundreds of mosques in the UK, espousing a very hardline Wahhabist interpretation of Islam. It is often in these institutions that British extremism takes root.��
The contents of the report may prove politically as well as legally sensitive. Saudi Arabia, which has been a funding source for fundamentalist Islamist preachers and mosques, was visited by May earlier this year.
Last December, a leaked report from Germany�셲 federal intelligence service accused several Gulf groups of funding religious schools and radical Salafist preachers in mosques, calling it �쏿 long-term strategy of influence��.
The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said he felt the government had not held up its side of the bargain made ahead of the vote on airstrikes. The report must be published when it was completed, he insisted, despite the Home Office caution that information in the document would be sensitive.
�쏷hat short-sighted approach needs to change. It is critical that these extreme, hardline views are confronted head on, and that those who fund them are called out publicly,�� he said.
�쏧f the Conservatives are serious about stopping terrorism on our shores, they must stop stalling and reopen investigation into foreign funding of violent extremism in the UK.��
The long-lost ship of British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, HMS Terror, has been found in pristine condition at the bottom of an Arctic bay, researchers have said, in a discovery that challenges the accepted history behind one of polar exploration�셲 deepest mysteries.
HMS Terror and Franklin�셲 flagship, HMS Erebus, were abandoned in heavy sea ice far to the north of the eventual wreck site in 1848, during the Royal Navy explorer�셲 doomed attempt to complete the Northwest Passage.
All 129 men on the Franklin expedition died, in the worst disaster to hit Britain�셲 Royal Navy in its long history of polar exploration. Search parties continued to look for the ships for 11 years after they disappeared, but found no trace, and the fate of the missing men remained an enigma that tantalised generations of historians, archaeologists and adventurers.
Now that mystery seems to have been solved by a combination of intrepid exploration �� and an improbable tip from an Inuk crewmember.
On Sunday, a team from the charitable Arctic Research Foundation manoeuvred a small, remotely operated vehicle through an open hatch and into the ship to capture stunning images that give insight into life aboard the vessel close to 170 years ago.
�쏻e have successfully entered the mess hall, worked our way into a few cabins and found the food storage room with plates and one can on the shelves,�� Adrian Schimnowski, the foundation�셲 operations director, told the Guardian by email from the research vessel Martin Bergmann.
�쏻e spotted two wine bottles, tables and empty shelving. Found a desk with open drawers with something in the back corner of the drawer.��
The well-preserved wreck matches the Terror in several key aspects, but it lies 60 miles (96km) south of where experts have long believed the ship was crushed by ice, and the discovery may force historians to rewrite a chapter in the history of exploration.
The 10-member Bergmann crew found the massive shipwreck, with her three masts broken but still standing, almost all hatches closed and everything stowed, in the middle of King William Island�셲 uncharted Terror Bay on 3 September.
After finding nothing in an early morning search, the research vessel was leaving the bay when a grainy digital silhouette emerged from the depths on the sounder display on the bridge of the Bergmann.
�쏣veryone was up in the wheelhouse by that point in awe, really,�� said Daniel McIsaac, 23, who was at the helm when the research vessel steamed straight over the sunken wreck.
Since, then, the discovery team has spent more than a week quietly gathering images of the vessel and comparing them with the Terror�셲 19th century builders�� plans, which match key elements of the sunken vessel.
At first, the Terror seemed to be listing at about 45 degrees to starboard on the seabed. But on the third dive with a remotely operated vehicle, �쐗e noticed the wreck is sitting level on the sea bed floor not at a list - which means the boat sank gently to the bottom,�� Schimnowski said Monday.
About 24 metres (80ft) down, the wreck is in perfect condition, with metal sheeting that reinforced the hull against sea ice clearly visible amid swaying kelp.
A long, heavy rope line running through a hole in the ship�셲 deck suggests an anchor line may have been deployed before the Terror went down.
If true, that sets up the tantalising possibility that British sailors re-manned the vessel after she was abandoned at the top of Victoria Strait in a desperate attempt to escape south.
One crucial detail in the identification of the ship is a wide exhaust pipe rising above the outer deck.
It is in the precise location where a smokestack rose from the locomotive engine which was installed in the Terror�셲 belly to power the ship�셲 propeller through closing sea ice, said Schimnowski in a phone interview.
The ship�셲 bell lies on its side on the deck, close to where the sailor on watch would have have swung the clapper to mark time.
And the majestic bowsprit, six metres (20ft) long, still points straight out from the bow as it did when the crew tried to navigate through treacherous ice that eventually trapped Erebus and Terror on 12 September 1846.
The wreck is in such good condition that glass panes are still in three of four tall windows in the stern cabin where the ship�셲 commander, Captain Francis Crozier, slept and worked, Schimnowski added.
�쏷his vessel looks like it was buttoned down tight for winter and it sank,�� he said. �쏣verything was shut. Even the windows are still intact. If you could lift this boat out of the water, and pump the water out, it would probably float.��
The Arctic Research Foundation was set up by Jim Balsillie, a Canadian tech tycoon and philanthropist, who co-founded Research in Motion, creator of the Blackberry.
Balsillie, who also played a key role in planning the expedition, proposed a theory to explain why it seems both Terror and Erebus sank far south of where they were first abandoned.
�쏷his discovery changes history,�� he told the Guardian. �쏥iven the location of the find [in Terror Bay] and the state of the wreck, it�셲 almost certain that HMS Terror was operationally closed down by the remaining crew who then re-boarded HMS Erebus and sailed south where they met their ultimate tragic fate.��
The 21st-century search for Franklin�셲 expedition was launched by Canadian former prime minister Stephen Harper as part of a broader plan to assert Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic and promote development of its resources �� including vast reserves of oil and natural gas, which will be easier to exploit as the Arctic warms and sea ice disappears.
Parks Canada underwater archeologists have led the mission since it began in 2008. Now they must confirm the wreck is Terror, either by examining the foundation�셲 images or visiting the site themselves. With the first winter snow already falling in the High Arctic, Terror Bay will soon be encased in thick sea ice.
The latest discovery was made two years and a day after Canadian marine archeologists found the wreck of Erebus in the same area of eastern Queen Maud gulf where Inuit oral history had long said a large wooden ship sank.
The same stories described startled Inuit stumbling upon a large dead man in a dark room on the vessel, with a big smile. Experts have suggested that may have been a rictus smile, or evidence that the man had suffered from scurvy.
Parks Canada archeologists found Erebus standing in just 11 meters of ocean. Sea ice had taken a large bite out her stern, and more than a century of storm-driven waves had scattered a trove of artifacts around the site.
So far, archaeologists have brought up the bell from Franklin�셲 flagship, a cannon, ceramic plate and other objects.
Inuit knowledge was also central to finding the Terror Bay wreck, but in a more mysterious way. Crewman Sammy Kogvik, 49, of Gjoa Haven, had been on the Bergmann for only a day when, chatting with Schimnowski on the bridge, he told a bizarre story.
About six years ago, Kogvik said, he and a hunting buddy were headed on snowmobiles to fish in a lake when they spotted a large piece of wood, which looked like a mast, sticking out of the sea ice covering Terror Bay.
In a phone interview, Kogvik said he stopped that day to get a few snapshots of himself hugging the wooden object, only to discover when he got home that the camera had fallen out his pocket.
Kogvik resolved to keep the encounter secret, fearing the missing camera was an omen of bad spirits, which generations of Inuit have believed began to wander King William Island after Franklin and his men perished.
When Schimnowski heard Kogvik�셲 story, he didn�셳 dismiss it, as Inuit testimony has been so often during the long search for Franklin�셲 ships.
Instead, the Bergmann�셲 crew agreed to make a detour for Terror Bay on their way to join the main search group aboard the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Royal Canadian Navy�셲 HMCS Shawinigan, at the north end of Victoria Strait.
That is where the only known record of the Franklin expedition provided coordinates for what experts now call the point of abandonment.
A scrawled note dated 25 April 1848, and concealed in a stone cairn at Victory Point on northern King William Island, said Erebus and Terror had been abandoned three days earlier, stuck in sea ice.
Crozier was in command of �쐔he officers and crews, consisting of 105 souls��, because Franklin had died on 11 June 1847, the note continued, �쏿nd the total loss by deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men��.
Crozier and Captain James Fitzjames signed the note, which had what seemed a hurried postscript, scrawled upside down in the top right corner: �쏿nd start on to-morrow 26th for Back�셲 Fish River��.
Survivors apparently hoped to follow the river �� now known as Back river �� south to safety at a Hudson�셲 Bay Company fur trading outpost.
None made it, and for generations, the accepted historical narrative has described a brutal death march as the Royal Navy mariners tried to walk out of the Arctic, dying along the way.
Now Franklin experts will have to debate whether at least some of the dying sailors instead mustered incredible strength, fighting off hunger, disease and frostbite, in a desperate attempt to sail home.
Britain has become more vulnerable to terrorist attacks because �쐄rustrated travellers�� are finding it more difficult to get to Syria and are being urged by different extremist groups to commit atrocities in the UK.
The return of some British fighters from Syria has added to a complex picture, which means the UK�셲 counter-terrorism agencies are feeling heat from all sides, intelligence sources said.
�쏷here is pressure on the counter-extremism strategy because of the confluence of frustrated travellers who would go to Syria if they could but are stuck here, and returnees,�� said one Whitehall source.
�쏝oth Isis (Islamic State) and al-Qaida are calling for these travellers to stay at home and attack in the west instead. The risk seems far greater now. The risk is changing.��
The police and intelligence services are seeking to establish the motive of the Manchester killer, Salman Abedi, and whether he was working alone or part of a wider network. Although Isis claimed responsibility, the police have not found any evidence to support this.
The MI5 director, Andrew Parker, cautioned last year that the agencies could stop most but not all attacks, while his MI6 counterpart, Alex Younger, warned of highly organised external attack-planning structures within Isis.
Sources pointed to a message posted earlier this month by Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden. He urged lone actors to seek martyrdom in the west, echoing the calls more frequently made by Isis as the group comes under intense military pressure in Iraq and Syria.
Hamza called on followers to �쏿venge�� the �쐁hildren of Syria��, the �쐗idows of Palestine��, the �쐄ree, honourable women of Iraq�� and �쐔he orphans of Afghanistan��.
Messages like this are being supplemented with instructions to commit jihad made on subscription channels set up on messenger services such as Telegram. �쏷hey are echo chambers and war rooms where they plan how to spread material on social media,�� said the source.
Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorism expert at the Royal United Service Institute thinktank based in London, said: �쏛l-Qaida has always been a threat, and Isis persists in calling for attacks.
�쏧 think this is reflected in recent patterns of arrest in the UK. There appear to have been more for plotting terrorist attacks than before, rather than the usual funding and propaganda. The tempo may be changing.��
The UK has faced 13 serious terrorist plots since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in May 2013, the Met police�셲 assistant commissioner and national lead on counter-terror policing, Mark Rowley, said in an BBC interview in March. But the list has grown by several more since then.
In addition to these plots and alleged plots, the police make arrests almost every week for lesser offences, from alleged support for terrorists to downloading terrorist-related material from jihadi websites.
More than 850 UK citizens have travelled to fight for Isis and other jihadi groups in Syria and Iraq, of whom about half have returned. The MI5 watchlist of people of concern has risen to about 3,000 and includes some who have returned from Syria. Those returning are assessed and placed in various categories, ranging from high to low risk.
Although the budget of all three intelligence agencies has been increased, MI5 only has the resources to maintain physical surveillance on a limited number of people. The people needed to maintain surveillance varies from case to case but a large number would be needed to keep tabs on even one person for 24 hours.
After the London bombings, MI5, which had been concentrated in London and Belfast, decentralised, establishing regional centres in the north-west of England and elsewhere around the UK.
The joint terrorism analysis centre, which is housed in MI5 headquarters and brings together the UK agencies and police dealing with counter-terrorism, upgraded the threat level from severe, the fourth highest ranking, established in 2014 amid fears of jihadis returning from Syria.
Moving it on to the fifth and highest level, critical, is only supposed to reflect security service fears that another attack is imminent. But it may be a precautionary, temporary measure until it is established whether Abedi was acting alone or with others.
The role of MI5 will come under scrutiny over whether the bomber was under surveillance. Abedi had been on MI5�셲 radar but was not considered high-risk. His name had come up in relation to other investigations but he was viewed as a peripheral figure, much the same as the terrorist responsible for the Westminster attack, Khalid Masood.
The intelligence agencies repeatedly warn that they do not have the resources to mount 24-hour physical surveillance of more than a small number of the 500 suspects regarded as being of concern.
The failure to prevent the Manchester attack will be felt keenly by all the intelligence agencies. Parker reflected this in an unusually personal statement for one of the heads of the UK�셲 three intelligence agencies.
�쏣veryone at MI5 is revolted by the disgusting terrorist attack in Manchester last night,�� he said, adding: �쏻e remain relentlessly focused, in numerous current operations, on doing all we can to combat the scourge of terrorism and keep the country safe.��
Theresa May�셲 �쐃nough is enough�� speech is an attempt to reshape dramatically Britain�셲 policy to thwart terror after murderous attacks. Mrs May gave her most explicit pitch today to policing thoughts rather than acts. This is a bad idea. It rests on a strategy to counter ideology rather than one that counters terrorism. It penalises people for holding unspoken beliefs and promotes a form of thoughtcrime. Such a move would end up with Britain losing the fight against terrorism in a legal minefield of dogma and piety. Mrs May wants us to believe that we face a threat from doctrines that do not espouse violence but somehow mutate into terror by contingency. The conclusion of her speech is that a non-violent person who harbours anti-British, extremist thoughts �� to be defined presumably by a future parliament �� could be blacklisted, maybe even criminalised. This is a leap away from current policy, although Mrs May has been heading in this direction for years. It should worry us all. What of animal rights, ecological defence or anti-arms-trade activists who do not subscribe to violent belief systems when criminal acts �� sometimes amounting to terror �� have been carried out in their name? Will they be banned too?
Non-violent extremism is not just difficult to define. Even if one could ban so-called adherents from public positions this would hinder, not help, the fight against terrorism. Facing the threat of terrorism means the government is obligated to exploit every possible avenue to prevent it. Mrs May�셲 policies exclude cooperation with the very people who might be best placed as discouragers of terrorism: those who hold혻similar �쐃xtremist�� beliefs but who are non-violent and are opposed to the methods of violence. Mrs May�셲 plans criminalise the eyes and ears you need to spot terror.
Then there is the need for unity. Even before the police publicly commented on the identity of the three attackers, the prime minister had linked the London Bridge massacre, last month�셲 Manchester suicide bombing and the Westminster terrorist outrage in March to a �쐓ingle evil ideology of Islamist extremism��. Politicians should take care in the language they use. Both al-Qaida and Islamic State have tried to claim the mantle of Islam for barbarism and death. We should not play into their hands. Mrs May should not have lumped together murderers and peaceful Muslims who are simply observant rather than violent, even if it might be politically expedient to use such words. Ukip trades in crude Islamophobia and perhaps Mrs May wants to ensure she is not outflanked when a shiver of fright runs through the electorate. It may allow her to paint, surreptitiously, her Labour opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, as tolerant of extremists. But such words risk pulling people apart when they need to come together.
Have we learned nothing from our own history? Listening to the prime minister speak from outside Downing Street, it is troubling to conclude that we have not. The wickedness that saw ordinary Londoners enjoying a night out mown down in the street and stabbed in bars must not mean we trade too much liberty for security. More than four decades ago in October 1974, a terrorist bombing saw people lose their lives and scores injured within a week of a general election. A few months later MPs voted for the Prevention of Terrorism Act, containing emergency �쐔emporary�� powers so draconian they needed to be renewed yearly. What were meant to be crisis measures became permanent. Current legislation reproduces much of the earlier problematic law, along with more intrusive powers. The aim of terror is to scare us into changing the nature of our democracy. Promoting sweeping new measures with alacrity in response to terrorist acts is no way to proceed. Politicians should steer public sentiment on matters of national security. But they should do so in an atmosphere becalmed by reasoned debate; not in the frenzy of the final days of a혻general혻election.
Last week�셲 attacks in Paris and this week�셲 arrests in Belgium and Germany have thrown the spotlight on to jihadis returning from Syria to hatch terror plots in Europe. The five countries deemed to be at most risk of attack are Belgium, France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.

The French government has created a smartphone app designed to send warnings directly to people�셲 phones in the event of a bombing, shooting or other disaster.
Two days before the Euro 2016 football tournament opens in France amid a high police and military presence, the French interior ministry unveiled its alert app called Saip (Syst챔me d�셙lerte et d�셢nformation des populations), which was developed after last November�셲 coordinated terrorist attacks across Paris killed 130 people.
Available in English and French, the app can be configured to receive an alert if an attack occurs near the user. In the event of a terrorist bombing or shooting, the smartphone screen turns crimson and displays the word �쏛LERT��, a brief description of what is happening and advice on how to react.
Although the screen turns red, there is no sound or vibration so that anyone who might be hiding near possible attackers is not put in danger by their phone sounding, the daily Lib챕ration reported. The user then clicks on an information button to find out if a police operation is under way and what to do.
The app is also seen by the government as an official counterpoint to possible inaccurate speculation on social media. Its alerts can be shared on Facebook and Twitter.
The app was initially configured to alert only on armed attacks and bombings, but officials plan to update it so that it can flag industrial accidents, floods and other emergencies.
Advice already on the app includes general tips on what to do in other emergencies, such as a nuclear alert, including �쐔ake cover in a closed building��, �쐂o not pick up your children from school�� and �쐂o not overcrowd telephone networks��.
The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said after the November attacks that he wanted to improve information to the public at a time of crisis.
Britain will need to radically change its strategy to stop jihadi attacks because the threat is now at a �쐁ompletely different�� level of danger, according to the country�셲 top counter-terrorism officer.
Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, said the changes could cover police, MI5, communities, technology companies, the law and other policies.
Rowley outlined his blueprint as police admitted that Khuram Shazad Butt, the London Bridge attacker pictured in a football shirt with a hoax suicide bomb belt, had been investigated in 2015 but ruled out as a potential terrorist attacker.
The assistant commissioner admitted Butt had been categorised as not posing a risk of attack two years ago.
The investigation into the attacks involved two more raids on Monday in Newham and Barking, east London, as police tried to establish if the three attackers had any help. The Renault van used to stage the attack was hired just before the attack, police said. On Monday night police said that all 12 people arrested following the attacks had been released without charge.
Butt, Rachid Redouane and a third man not yet named by police hit people with a van on London Bridge and then went on to stab others on Saturday night. Seven people were killed and at least 48 were injured. The attackers were killed in a hail of 46 bullets fired by eight police officers.
The attack came after atrocities in Westminster on 22 March and Manchester on 22 May, with suspected attack plots foiled in between, one of which was by chance.
Rowley said: �쏧n nine weeks, we�셶e had five plots foiled and three successful attacks. That is completely different to anything we have seen for a long time. As the prime minister has indicated, we�셱e going to need to do some things differently.
�쏻e�셱e going to have to think again about the next iteration of our police and security service model, which has constantly had to innovate over many decades.��
He said of Butt: �쏻e will probably discover information on covert communications that were [not in] our knowledge that if we had access to those communications it may have changed our judgment.��
At a press briefing with questions mounting about what the authorities knew, Rowley said: �쏫huram Shazad Butt was known to the police and MI5. But there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly.��
Counter-terrorism sources have been warning of an increasing workload since 2014 following the rise of Islamic State and its declaration of a caliphate which 900 Britons are believed to have traveled to.
There are 3,000 people suspected of jihadi activity �� Butt was in this pool �� and 20,000 former suspects, who included Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi.
Rowley said more would be asked of communities to challenge extremism, and of the private sector, believed to be a reference to internet companies. He said the new government would �쐗ant to wrestle again with legal and policy issues��.
The Met�셲 commissioner, Cressida Dick, warned of a �쐍ew reality�� of terrorist threat after the attacks on London Bridge and Borough Market. Into this mix come fears about battle-hardened Britons returning from Isis-held territory in Syria as the terrorist group loses territory, adding to the threat.
Two of the attacks have come since the general election was called, catapulting security into the political debate.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, backed calls for Theresa May to resign, saying: �쏻e should never have cut the police numbers��. They fell by 20,000 while she was home secretary.
May responded that she gave police extra powers to deal with terrorism, which Corbyn had opposed when he was a backbench MP.
�쏪eremy Corbyn has boasted that he has opposed those powers and opposed the powers for anti-terror actions throughout his time in parliament,�� she said. �쏛nd I also support, absolutely, shoot-to-kill and I think what we saw on our streets on Saturday was how important that was.��
On Monday, 36 people remained in hospital, 18 in a critical condition.
The family of James McMullan, a 32-year-old from London, said they believed he was among the dead. His sister, Melanie McMullan, said police had found his bank card on a body at the scene.
It emerged that Christine Archibald from British Columbia in Canada died in the arms of her fiance, Tyler Ferguson. The French government confirmed that a French man was killed and French media reported that seven people from France were injured, four of them critically.
Crowds gathered outside City Hall for a vigil for the victims on Monday night where the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, laid white roses.
Police named the second attacker as Rachid Redouane, 30, who claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. He was not known to police and MI5 before the attack on Saturday. The third attacker has not been named.
Butt is reported to have associated with al-Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group whose leader Anjem Choudary has been linked to the recruitment of more than 100 British terrorism suspects. He featured in a Channel 4 documentary about British jihadis and was thrown out of a mosque in Barking for repeatedly challenging the imam.
Rowley said he had seen nothing to suggest mistakes were made in assessing the danger Butt posed in 2015, despite a member of the public complaining about him to the anti-terrorism hotline.
In January, Brooklyn teenager Osiris Aristy was arrested for �쐌aking a terroristic threat��. If convicted, this would carry a sentence of up to seven years in prison. In part, the case turns on the use of emojis in some of the 17-year-old�셲 Facebook status updates. Among other posts, expressing typically teenage concerns, three now-deleted updates appeared to convey his disdain for the police using emojis of a police officer and a revolver.
This case is especially noteworthy as the basis for Aristy�셲 alleged �쐔errorist threat�� �� which falls under the New York legal statutes on terrorism (introduced after 9/11) �� does not include a written or verbal threat. Aristy�셲 arrest was primarily based on his use of emojis.
Emojis originated in Japan. They literally mean �쐏icture��(e)-�쓈haracter�� (moji). As you might expect, emojis are particularly popular among teenagers, where they can be used as a shorthand symbol to express an often fairly complex idea or emotion in a visually evocative and appealing way. But can emojis be construed as a language; one that can potentially fall foul of increasingly stringent anti-terrorist laws around the globe?
Emojis constitute a class of what linguists refer to as icons. Like the recycle bin or trash can on your computer desktop, an icon is a sign that, in some way, resembles the thing it evokes. The recycle bin icon on my computer is the place where I delete files. But in most cases, natural languages such as English or Japanese eschew icons in favour of signs known as symbols, which are quite different from icons. The symbols (or words) that make up a spoken language are meaningful, not because of any inherent resemblance relationship with the ideas that they point to, but rather, their meaning derives from an unspoken agreement between speakers of a linguistic community: the symbol will point to a specific entity or idea, agreed upon by all. This is known as a �쐋inguistic convention��. For instance, the same idea conveyed by the English word �쐁at�� is represented in different ways, across languages: �쐁hat�� in French, �쐀illi�� in Hindi, and �쐇kati�� in Zulu, for instance.
So, from this perspective, emojis �� icons �� function in quite a different way from the symbols used in English. Nevertheless, spoken languages do make use of some iconic signs. Many English words for animal sounds, ranging from �쐀uzz�� to �쐌oo��, are iconic: they resemble the sound produced by the animal they relate to, the bee and the cow respectively. And English is not unusual in this.
But language is not restricted to a specific medium for its expression. Since the 1960s, it has been recognised that sign languages, which make use of the manual-gestural medium, are fully functional languages, with the same levels of lexical and grammatical complexity as spoken languages. And as findings on signing have amassed, today we know that sign languages make extensive use of iconic reference, arguably far greater than in spoken languages. This is a consequence of the medium of expression: hand shapes and gestures can more readily depict an idea or entity, in iconic fashion, than is possible in the spoken medium. This shows that the once-heralded hallmark of human language �� that it predominantly makes use of symbolic reference �� may not be a hard-and-fast requirement for a communicative system. As emojis amount to iconic signs, ideally suited to the visual medium of expression, they are not automatically disqualified from being language-like.
Perhaps a better way of characterising a language, then, is in terms of the functions it fulfils. There are two very important ones: first, a language is used to convey ideas, and, second, to influence others. In short, an important function of language is to enable us perform actions, sometimes referred to as �쐓peech acts��, that can even change aspects of the world. These might range from the significant, when a member of the clergy pronounces a couple husband and wife, to the more banal, as when I ask a passerby in the street to give me the time. And from this perspective, the use of emojis, potentially at least, can be used to fulfil both functions: they can convey ideas, and be used to influence the mental states, emotions, and even behaviours of others.
In the case of Osiris Aristy, the issue will turn on whether a reasonable person would interpret his teenage disdain as a terrorist threat; or perhaps, whether his use of emojis was intended as a threat. And that is a slightly different issue. But, as emojis, and the way they are increasingly being used, share some of the attributes common to language, then, in principle at least, they could be used to make terrorist threats, and can be interpreted as such.

Theresa May has declared she is prepared to rip up human rights laws to impose new restrictions on terror suspects, as she sought to gain control over the security agenda just 36 hours before the polls open.
The prime minister said she was looking at how to make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and how to increase controls on extremists where it is thought they present a threat but there is not enough evidence to prosecute them.
The last-ditch intervention comes after days of pressure on May over the policing cuts and questions over intelligence failures, following terror attacks on London Bridge, Manchester and Westminster.
She said: �쏝ut I can tell you a few of the things I mean by that: I mean longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences. I mean making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terror suspects to their own countries.
�쏛nd I mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat, but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court.
�쏛nd if human rights laws stop us from doing it, we will change those laws so we can do it.��
The proposed measures appear to be an attempt at strengthening terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) rather than a complete return to Labour�셲 control orders, which were repeatedly struck down by the courts and then scrapped by May in 2010 when she was home secretary.
They could involve further curfews, restrictions on association with other known extremists, controls on where they can travel and limits on access to communication devices.
She could even increase the period for which terror suspects can be held without trial, currently 14 days �� a move that provoked clashes with civil liberties campaigners when Tony Blair attempted it after the 7 July 2005 attacks.
May told the Sun she would consult the intelligence agencies about what they think is needed: �쏻hen we reduced it to 14 days, we actually allowed for legislation to enable it to be at 28 days. We said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this. I will listen to what they think is necessary for us to do.��
The Conservatives have promised not to withdraw from the European convention on human rights during the next parliament but they could begin to try to replace or amend parts of the Human Rights Act after the UK leaves the EU.
It is possible May�셲 plans could involve seeking further derogations from the ECHR. This is the way the government is seeking to prevent human rights claims against soldiers in future military situations.Earlier in the day, the prime minister tried to return her election campaign to the issues of Brexit and her leadership, as the Tories�� poll lead over Jeremy Corbyn�셲 Labour remained narrow.
But she continued to face a barrage of questions over the impact of cuts to policing. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said planned cuts of 10-40% in London over the next four years would make it �쐆arder to foil terrorist attacks on our city��.
May was then repeatedly challenged about how the Home Office, police and intelligence services dealt with the information relating to the attackers, after Boris Johnson, her foreign secretary, said MI5 had questions to answer. One of the attackers, Khuram Butt, 27, had been reported to the anti-terror hotline in 2015 and a third attacker, Youssef Zaghba, 22, had been detained by Italian authorities in 2016.
Zaghba, named by police for the first time yesterday, was put on an international terrorism database for an attempt to travel to Syria in March 2016 which was thwarted after he allegedly told officials at Bologna: �쏧 am going to be a terrorist.�� But this does not seem to have been spotted by UK intelligence agencies.
His mother, Valeria Collina, told the Italian news magazine L�섷spresso that her son was �쐄riends�� with the two other men and monitored by Italian officials after his failed journey to Syria.
May said she �쏿bsolutely recognised people�셲 concerns�� and added that she expected the intelligence agencies to launch a review of the London Bridge attack.
�쏻e need to look at how the terror threat is evolving, the way that terrorism is breeding terrorism and the increased tempo of attacks. We have had three horrific attacks and we have foiled five others. The tempo is there in a way we haven�셳 seen before,�� she said.
�쏻e will look at how the processes were followed, what they did. They will want to be looking at that because they will want to learn lessons for the future, if there are those lessons to be learned.��
She added: �쏷he police and security service have done a good job in foiling a number of plots �� just five in the last three months, and a significant number in the last few years as well.��
May declined to say whether Zaghba had been monitored or subject to an exclusion order when he returned to the UK after being stopped in Italy, and declined an opportunity to apologise for any failures by the intelligence agencies.
Despite having previously said she believed the police and security services had the resources they needed to deal with terrorism, she went on to announce details of a proposed crackdown on terrorism at a rally of Conservative activists in Slough.
Her remarks suggested that if she is re-elected her government could look to step up the use of orders that restrict the movement of terror suspects.
There are currently only seven terror suspects considered enough of a threat to be given Tpims, while there are about 23,000 people considered to have been subjects of interest by the security services. Tpims, which expire after two years, can include overnight curfews of up to 10 hours, electronic tagging, reporting regularly to the police, exclusion from certain zones, enforced relocation and some limitations on use of a mobile phone and the internet.
Elements of the orders could be strengthened but any attempt to return to the 18-hour-a-day curfews imposed by control orders would be likely to end up in the courts.
May�셲 proposals follow criticism from Labour and other parties about her cuts to policing and approach to tackling terrorism in the Home Office, which she led for six years. Corbyn accused the prime minister on Sunday night of trying to �쐏rotect the public on the cheap�� by implementing 20,000 police cuts.
The prime minister has also been accused of politicising her response to the London Bridge terror attack when she addressed the nation outside Downing Street on Sunday. She declared �쐃nough is enough�� as she announced plans to
introduce new anti-terror laws, without going into details about what
she would do.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: �쏽ou can�셳 keep our country safe on the cheap. Theresa May is refusing to put in the resources that are needed. She has slashed funding for the police, our courts system and border force.
�쏧 will do everything necessary and effective to keep our people safe. We will always keep the law under review, but don�셳 believe would-be terrorists and suicide bombers will be deterred by longer sentences or restricting our rights at home.
�쏷he right response to the recent attacks is to halt the Conservative cuts and invest in our police and security services and protect our democratic values, including the Human Rights Act.
�쏧t is disgraceful that the Conservative government is suppressing its own report into terrorist funding. We will not shy away from the difficult conversations about who funds and supports terrorism.��
Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said May was only �쐏osturing about being tough on terror��. He added: �쏧n her years as home secretary she was willing to offer up the police for cut after cut. We have been here before �� a kind of nuclear arms race in terror laws might give the appearance of action, but what the security services lack is not more power, but more resources. And responsibility for that lies squarely with Theresa May.��
The London Bridge attack on Saturday night left seven people dead, and 15 remain in hospital in critical condition. Raids and searches of properties in east London continue, but 12 others arrested as part of inquiries into whether anyone else helped the attackers have been released without charge.
France goes to the polls on Sunday with terrorist violence casting a long shadow over its fraught presidential election, after the shooting of a policeman on the Champs 횋lys챕es deepened already bitter political divisions.
Candidates with radically opposing visions for the country�셲 future clashed openly over the response to the killing, claimed by Islamic State less than 72 hours before polling stations open.
The frontrunner, Emmanuel Macron, accused his two closest rivals of using the killing of Xavier Jugel챕, 37, and the serious wounding of two other police officers on Thursday night to score political points before Sunday�셲 first-round vote.
Macron suggested the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, with whom he is neck-and-neck in polling for the first-round vote, and the rightwing candidate Fran챌ois Fillon �� currently in third place �� were engaging in one-upmanship in their response to the attack. Hardline statements from Le Pen and Fillon spoke of a country �쏿t war�� with radical Islam, which they described as organised, expansionist, totalitarian and barbaric.
The gunman, identified by prosecutors on Friday as Karim Cheurfi, 39, had a long record of violence against police including two attempted murders.
Shot dead as he attempted to flee the scene after firing on a police van with an automatic rifle, he was reportedly under surveillance by intelligence services but was not flagged as a potential jihadi threat.
The US president, Donald Trump, offered a tacit endorsement of LePen, describing her as the �쐓trongest�� candidate.
The US president told the Associated Press that although he was not �쐃xplicitly endorsing�� the leader of the Front National, she was the �쐓trongest on borders, and she�셲 the strongest on what�셲 been going on in France.��
Earlier on Friday Trump tweeted that the attack would have a �쐀ig effect�� on the election, adding: �쏷he people of France will not take much more of this.��
Campaigning for the first round ends at midnight on Friday and polls suggest any two of four leading candidates could go through to the runoff on 7 May.
The French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the government had reviewed its extensive election security measures and was fully mobilised in the wake of the attack. He appealed for national unity and for people �쐍ot to succumb to fear��.
Cazeneuve said more than 50,000 police and gendarmes and 7,000 soldiers would be on duty for Sunday�셲 first-round vote in the two-stage election, and nothing could be allowed to �쐆amper this democratic moment��.
Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister running as an independent centrist, said in response to the attack that it was vital for people to summon a �쐓pirit of responsibility in what is an extreme period�� and come up with a measured response to �쏿 tragic event that has left our country in grief��.
�쏻e must not give way to panic, nor in any way allow any attempt to manipulate these events,�� he said at a press conference. �쏷he terrorists want to destabilise the country �� at a time when the French are deciding on their future.��
He promised that if elected he would create a presidential unit to �쐗ork around the clock�� to tackle Isis. �쏛 vigorous offensive will be taken to fight Islamic radicalisation, especially on the internet,�� he said. �쏷his is a moral challenge, a challenge for civilisation.��
He accused Le Pen of lying when she claimed she could have prevented previous attacks if she had been in office. �쏶he won�셳 be able to protect our citizens,�� Macron said.
Le Pen, widely seen as taking the hardest line on security, had earlier taken a characteristically tough stance against Islamic extremism, branding it a �쐀arbaric and monstrous totalitarian ideology�� and insisting France immediately take back control of its borders from the European Union.
She said France must engage in a �쐗ar against terrorism�� and accused successive French governments of being too lax towards fundamentalists. She demanded the immediate expulsion of foreigners linked to Islamism and flagged as suspects considered a potential risk to national security.
Those with joint nationality should be stripped of their French citizenship and expelled to their country of origin, she said. �쏷his war is asymmetric and revolutionary. It is a war in which all the population, all the country is targeted. It is obviously a war we cannot lose,�� Le Pen told journalists.
�쏷he Islamist, Salafist ideology has no right to be in France and should be banned. Preachers of hate should be expelled and their mosques closed.��
Like Le Pen and Macron, Fillon, the rightwing candidate whose campaign has been hit by allegations he paid his wife, Penelope, public money for parliamentary assistance she did not provide, cancelled planned end-of-campaign meetings on Friday.
He said France must show it was united, and not afraid. For years �쏧 have been warning that we are confronting an Islamic totalitarianism, in other words, an ideology that is radical, organised and expansionist,�� he said.
�쏧�셶e not stopped warning the government and my compatriots about the breadth and depth of that totalitarianism whose goal is to destroy our civilisation and crush all enemies from south-east Asia right up to west Africa.��
Cazeneuve criticised Le Pen and Fillon�셲 reactions, claiming they were excessive and divisive. He said Le Pen �쐓eeks, after each drama to exploit it to manipulate and divide in order to shamelessly exploit the fear and emotion for exclusively political ends��.
The Champs 횋lys챕es reopened on Friday morning having been sealed off for much of Thursday night as police ordered tourists back into hotels and blocked people from approaching the scene. Emergency vehicles blocked access and metro stations were closed.
France has been on its highest possible level of terror alert since the 2015 Charlie Hebdo and Paris attacks and the Nice truck attack of July 2016. Thousands of troops and armed police have been deployed to guard tourist hotspots such as the Champs 횋lys챕es.
This week, two men were arrested in Marseille on suspicion of planning an attack before the election. A machine-gun, two handguns and 3kg of TATP explosive were found at a flat in the southern city, along with Isis propaganda material.
Polls have suggested Le Pen and Macron are the most likely candidates to go through to the second-round runoff, but Fillon and the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc M챕lenchon are only two or three points behind, and up to 25% of voters have yet to make up their minds, making the race impossible to call.
Ragaa met Adel Abdul Bary, the man who would become her husband, in 1981. Her Egyptian family had moved from the countryside into a flat near the centre of Cairo. In those days she was a girl in tight jeans and a T-shirt, with long hair below her waist, though at her parents' insistence she tied it back in a plait, and was not allowed to wear makeup. At Cairo University, Ragaa found herself doing business studies instead of the art or music she had wanted to do, because her final school exam results were not good enough.
She hated her course but was entranced by the university world. Before long, other girls from her class, wearing hijab, began to take her aside and talk to her about how her beautiful hair should be hidden, encouraging her to come into the mosque area of the college. "I went," she says. "It was something different. I felt calm, peaceful in there."
Ragaa and her sister began to follow Islam more strictly than the rest of their Muslim family. It was the fashion for the educated young back then, she says. The two girls went to an all-female Islamic study circle where the male teacher sat the other side of a curtain. One day, Ragaa saw him after class in the street, a handsome man with a little beard and turban, and imagined how lovely it would be to be his wife. Later, his sister spoke to her about a marriage, and then to her great excitement, he and his family came to visit hers. The marriage was decided.
At the time Egypt was a tinder-box of political and religious tension. On 3 September 1981 President Anwar Sadat had ordered an extraordinary mass round-up of religious leaders, politicians, journalists, army officers and others. He mocked the girls wearing chadors, "going about like black tents", and the young men with beards. Sadat was assassinated shortly afterwards, during a military parade, by a handful of young Islamist officers, and was succeeded by another military leader, Hosni Mubarak.
After Adel's return from a year's study in Yemen, there was a formal written Islamic marriage. Ragaa thought the life she had imagined was about to begin but soon Adel was arrested like so many thousands opposed to the Mubarak regime. She spent six months travelling with his sister to every prison in Egypt to try to find him. When she finally did, he was a veteran of torture �� by hanging, electric shock and solitary confinement underground. There had been a period of hospitalisation, followed by ordinary prison. No one knew when Adel would be released, or if he ever would.
Tensions grew between the families, but Ragaa, for all her unhappiness, would not give up her marriage. "I was a stubborn teenager," she says. "Of course I resisted. It was pride. He was the first man in my life, and I wanted to support him, out of duty." Giving up her idea of work being haraam (sinful), she registered for a dressmaking course, only to have her sister-in-law tell her it was not allowed. Under his son's influence, Adel's father had also grown a beard; his sister was wearing a face veil. Adel himself had taken all the family photographs and burned them. So Ragaa stayed at home, and regretted it bitterly decades later.
Her husband came out of prison, but for those first years of their married life he was in and out again every six months or so �� torture became the almost unspoken constant of his experience, and for her a dark corner where she didn't want to let her mind go. "Miserable me," is her description of the person she had suddenly become.
Eventually Adel left for the US, and then later the UK. He had finished his degree in prison and was soon a well-known human-rights lawyer; he had strong contacts with Amnesty International in those years when arrests in Egypt of suspected opposition figures were in the thousands. In 1990, Adel gained refugee status in the UK, three years after he had arrived. Ragaa and the children joined him, and for five years they lived a quiet family life in London. Ragaa spoke little English, only went out occasionally, always with her husband and his friends and their wives. "He did everything, everything, for me and the kids here in London," she says. "And I was happy because he was with me, playing with the kids, taking us to the park �� it was the normal life we never had in Egypt."
In the summer of 1998, al-Qaida blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 220 people and wounding nearly 5,000. It ended that normal life in London. There was a dawn raid by British police in white contamination suits, brandishing truncheons and breaking down the front door. Ragaa and the children were traumatised. A dozen or so men were suddenly in their bedrooms, shouting for her husband, searching the children's clothes, tearing out pages from any books with telephone numbers.
Adel was led away, and Ragaa, hurriedly putting on her black hijab and abaya, was told to get into a bus with her five children, one of whom was a small baby. They were taken to a hotel where they stayed in their room for three or four days, without any information about why they were there, or how long it would be. She did not know how to phone her family in Egypt, and felt desperate and alone.
When they were finally taken home, she found her house upside down, drawers open, the front door broken and a metal gate across it. "I had absolutely no idea what to do �� he was the one who always knew everything," she says. After five days, however, her husband came home and family life resumed, without him discussing what had happened.
The British police found there was no terrorism case to charge Abdul Bary with. He was charged with possession of gas canisters, bailed, and then acquitted in a jury trial. (An official letter from the anti-terrorism police at the time stated that after nine months of exhaustive investigation, they found that he and the other Egyptian men arrested with him had no connection with al-Qaida, nor any connection with terrorism in Britain.)
However, six months later, Ragaa more than once noticed someone who seemed to be following them. Her old anxiety from the Cairo years flooded back. Her husband reported what she'd seen to the police. A week later he was rearrested. His extradition was requested by the US on exactly the same evidence dismissed in Britain the previous year. It had been sent by the UK to the US as part of the great fishing net of shared intelligence in the war on terror. His lawyers began to fight the extradition in a process that soon took on the character of Dickens's Jarndyce v Jarndyce in Bleak House.
An entire roomful of documentation built up. The committal papers from the US amounted to more than a dozen ring binders of documents, mostly in Arabic. Between 2002 and 2008, successive UK secretaries of state spent six years coming to a decision to extradite him. Representations for judicial reviews and appeals were made by his lawyers, including several medical reports, which over the years warned of his serious depression and risk of suicide in prison.
In those family milestones that mark a person's life �� his own mother's death, his daughter's wedding, his boys becoming men �� he was the unreachable ghost figure for his bewildered and overwhelmed family. Ragaa, unprepared in language or custom, overnight became a single mother, linked to her husband only by the daily telephone call from prison, or visits when a Muslim charity drove the family to Belmarsh, Brixton, Manchester or Long Lartin prisons.
"In the visits I left the kids to talk to him, play with him, sit with him, and I just watched," she says. "I thought about how unfair for them this is �� this is only how they know their dad." For her and the children the security checks for the visits were an ordeal, with women officers touching their bodies in the searches and police dogs sniffing them. They always felt hostility towards them �� for being foreign and the stigma of visiting a Category-A prisoner.
Years of dark depression inside the home crept past, Ragaa struggling with six children in isolation. She rarely phoned home to Egypt, gradually leaving the family bonds to wither. In 2004, her mother died. She had had no passport to visit her mother while she was ill, and she could not forgive herself for not being there.
As the children got older she began to hear about the London world outside her flat from the older ones, with stories about drugs, violence, knife crime and truancy among their schoolfriends. It terrified her. She took most of them out of school and taught them their GCSEs at home.
The exhaustion of doing all this, the weight of the responsibility, took a big toll on Ragaa's health. Money was very short. There was a time she slept on the floor as the family were a bed short, winters when she didn't turn on the heating. She developed health problems.
Her oldest daughter was married early to a cousin, something that Adel arranged from prison. Her babies were often in Ragaa's care too, as her daughter, with fluent English, took on the time-consuming and never-ending administrative battles with the local council or benefits office, set up hospital appointments for her mother.
One of Ragaa's two youngest girls wrote a poem after their father when he had been gone about six years. It was about her "honey-coloured teddy that was given to me from my Dad/Each time I looked at it, it made me feel sad." They wrote letters to their father, drew him pictures and talked to him when he phoned. All over the flat were the pictures he had begun to paint in prison �� some of bright flowers, but most heavy with the symbolism of prison: keys and cell bars. That atmosphere lay over the home.
Adel was stuck �� a bit player in one of the landmark cases of the war on terror, facing the prospect of lengthy pre-trial detention in a US supermax prison, a trial that none of his defence team believed could be fair, and then a possible life sentence. He and many others were named as defendants in the terrorism case called USA v Osama Bin Laden et al.
In London Adel's work had focused only on his own country, and he ran an office called International Office for the Defence of the Egyptian People. He put out a newsletter on Egyptian affairs, for which Ragaa, while looking after her children, used to write a weekly women's column.
The extradition case would put Adel Abdul Bary on trial with a large number of other defendants whose names were added over the years, charged with general conspiracy to kill Americans and with substantive charges in the east African embassy bombings. Ragaa blanked it out �� it was all too frightening to think about. The one concrete thing her husband was on trial for was his possession of a fax sent to him �� found in his office weeks after the events �� about the bombings of the US's East African embassies. (These faxes were everywhere in the Arab areas of London at the time, handed out in places such as outside the Regents Park and other mosques and sent to news organisations across the world.) This fax �� along with the al-Qaida defector Jamal Al Fadl's testimony on Egyptian Islamic Jihad's supposed al-Qaida links �� was apparently enough for the Americans to jump to the conclusion that Abdul Bary (never named by Al Fadl) had prior knowledge and responsibility in the bombings.
In 2001 three people were convicted for their roles in the bombing and a fourth for activities in the East African al-Qaida cell that carried it out. In 2011 another defendant, Ahmed Ghailani, was tried on 286 charges, found guilty on just one and received a life sentence.
For Ragaa all this detail, over so many years, passed her by �� she blanked it. "I don't read anything about it, I'm just not interested. Twenty years of all this politics has been too much. I have to live my kids' lives."
Ragaa enrolled in a dress-making course at a college of higher education with her husband's permission. It took her three visits to the college to persuade them to take her, because her English was weak. Every day she set off in the bus with her packed lunch and plunged into a class of giggly British women 20 years younger than her. The living room table at home became covered in cut-out paper patterns; she borrowed books, went to museums, searched the internet and sewed elaborate dresses that won prizes at her college. Ragaa's English made a leap forward and she ignored her acute fatigue, pain while walking and continuous confusion over benefit payments and the boys' schooling.
At the end of the year she passed with distinction and was accepted for a two-year higher level course �� although this time her husband told her he would prefer her to stay home.
He also told her he worried about her safety and preferred she did not make a trip to Cairo in 2009 when her British passport finally came through. But she went anyway, with her little girls and one boy. After 17 years she saw her own family again, and got a measure of how far the hard, lonely, years in London had taken her from an Egyptian life. Her family told her they found she had become cold and British.
In late 2010 her husband and the small group of Muslim men, all fighting deportation orders, were moved to Manchester prison while Long Lartin, where they had been for years, was refurbished. Soon the daily phone calls were punctuated with complaints about disrespect, racist behaviour by guards, new rules about phone calls having to be in English, not in Arabic. Manchester was so far that Ragaa did not manage to visit.
Then her husband told her he was going on hunger strike to protest about his treatment. The girls became convinced their father would die and spent tearful nights without sleeping, and days phoning their lawyers to ask them to make emergency visits to him.
Even after the Muslim detainee group were returned to Long Lartin, a new anxiety came to dominate her everyday life when her youngest daughter turned 10, and Ragaa's income support was reassessed. A Social Security or First Tier Tribunal assessed Ragaa as fit for work, despite evidence that she could only walk extremely slowly because of pain in one foot, and a sheaf of letters from doctors and hospitals about the various treatments she was undergoing.
Alternate Monday mornings became a humiliating ordeal as she went to sign on to get benefits. She did not complain, but her daughter, who went to physically support her and to translate, came back exasperated, with story after story of casual racism. She detailed the pain of experiencing open disrespect towards her mother, a woman in her 50s who had brought up six children, who was queried by a young official about why she "had never worked", or why she "didn't speak better English after all these years".
It is now four months since Ragaa and her children said goodbye to Adel in prison in Britain. Extradition had become inevitable in the autumn of 2012, after the European Court of Human Rights refused his final appeal. They brought his bed-clothes, his paintings and a few possessions home to London. The next day his usual phone call never came.
Since then, Ragaa has had only two 15-minute phone calls from Adel in his New York prison. He spoke to each child, leaving just time for a quiet word of greeting between husband and wife. Ragaa knows he is in solitary confinement and sees only his lawyers. The trial will be in October.
Alone in London now, she says: "My life, it is just my kids now �� but maybe, after 20 years of nothing but anxiety, maybe, maybe, I can say I'm recovering myself �� maybe."
�� This article was amended on 22 February 2013. The original said that "this vast case went nowhere until in 2011 one of the defendants, Ahmed Ghailani, was tried on 286 charges, found guilty on just one and received a life sentence." This has been corrected.
The head of US intelligence was exposed on national television yesterday as being unaware of the arrests in Britain of suspects in an alleged terrorist plot.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence, looked stumped when asked by Diane Sawyer on ABC about the arrests of 12 suspects in London and elsewhere around Britain earlier this week. "London?", Clapper asked, looking puzzled.
Later, the White House admitted that Clapper had not known about the developments in the UK.
John Brennan, the White House adviser on homeland security and security, said; "Should he have been briefed by his staff on those arrests? Yes."
The show was taped on Monday but hours after the arrests, which received wide coverage on US television.
The gaffe could make life difficult for Clapper as the post of director of national intelligence, since its creation after the 9/11 attacks, has been a controversial one, seen as an extra agency in an already crowded field, and without real power. It was intended to co-ordinate the work of the dozen or so US intelligence agencies but has yet to establish serious credibility.
Clapper's job is to brief the president each morning on intelligence developments.
One explanation offered is that he was focused on North-South Korean tensions. Brennan, defending Clapper at a press conference, said: "I know there was attention by the media about these arrests and it was constantly on the news networks. I am glad that Jim Clapper is not sitting in front of the TV 24 hours a day and monitoring what is coming out of the media."
Barack Obama on Sunday condemned an �쏿ct of terror and an act of hate��, after a gunman stormed an LGBT nightclub and shot dead 50 people in the worst mass shooting in American history.
The US president looked grave on what he said was an especially tragic day for lesbian and gay Americans, following the mass shooting at a haven for the vibrant LGBT community of central Florida.
The FBI identified the gunman as Omar Mateen, 29, a US citizen of Afghan heritage who was born in New York. He was killed when a police Swat team used a Bearcat vehicle to smash their way into the club and rescue 30 hostages early on Sunday morning.
The FBI special agent Ron Hopper told reporters Mateen had called the emergency 911 service before the attack, and spoke in �쐅eneral to the Islamic State��. Mateen was a known Isis sympathiser, Hopper said, and had been the subject of two previous investigations, closed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
He was interviewed repeatedly during those years, but the FBI was unable to verify any alleged ties to terrorists.
�쏦e is not a prohibited person, so he can legally walk into a gun dealership,�� a representative of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said. �쏦e did so within the last week or so.��
At the White House, where the US flag was lowered to half-mast, Obama said: �쏷oday marks the most deadly shooting in American history.��
The president said the full resources of the government would be used to investigate what he described as a �쐆orrific massacre�� and continued: �쏻e are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We�셶e reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer.
�쏷he FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I�셶e directed that we must spare no effort to determine what, if any, inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days we�셪l uncover how and why this happens and we�셪l go wherever the the facts lead us.��
The president, who had just met with FBI and homeland security officials, said families of the victims were �쐅rasping for answers with broken hearts��, adding: �쏛lthough it�셲 still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.��
He described it as �쏿n especially heartbreaking day for all of our friends and fellow Americans who are lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual��. They had gone to the club �쐔o be with friends, dancing and singing��, he said.
It was the 15th time Obama had addressed the country after a mass shooting. Less visibly emotional than on other occasions, the president made a brief reference to the gun control issue, saying: �쏷his massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that allows them to shoot people at a school, or a movie theater, or a church or a nightclub.
�쏷his could have been any one of our communities ... We have to decide whether that�셲 the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.��
As a stunned nation braced for a full tally of the victims, gay rights campaigners said they were �쐂evastated�� by the unprecedented attack on their community, which also left 53 people injured, many critically.
Buddy Dyer, the mayor of Orlando, said: �쏷oday we are dealing with something we never imagined and is unimaginable.��
Hopper, the FBI agent, told a morning press conference the case was being investigated as an act of terrorism. A US official, however, told the Guardian that while an unfolding federal investigation was in the earliest stages, an initial hypothesis regarding the shooter�셲 motive leaned closer to a hate crime than an act of terrorism.
�쏷he idea of it being terrorism is not off the table, but it�셲 probably not the principal approach,�� said the official, who wished to remain anonymous.
The tragedy happened amid an already febrile election campaign in which the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has called for a ban on Muslims entering the country because of fears of terrorism. In a sign of how the political tone could rapidly deteriorate, Trump first tweeted on Sunday: �쏛ppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don�셳 want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!��
Subsequently, Trump did not cite any sources when he tweeted: �쏳eporting that Orlando killer shouted �쁀llah hu Akbar!�� as he slaughtered clubgoers.��
In reference to a reported arrest in Los Angeles, Trump added: ��2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.��
The presumptive Republican nominee later issued a statement in which he called for Obama to �쐓tep down��, because he �쐂isgracefully refused to even say the words �쁒adical Islam�쇺��, and added: �쏧f Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words �쁒adical Islam�� she should get out of this race for the presidency.��
Clinton, the former secretary of state, was more circumspect. �쏧 join Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando, their families and the first responders who did everything they could to save lives,�� she said in a statement posted to Facebook.
Clinton did, however, call the attack �쏿n act of terror��, adding: �쏻e will learn more in the hours and days ahead. For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad.��
Clinton also called the attack �쏿n act of hate�� against the LGBT community.
After police said the shooter had an �쏛R-15-type assault rifle�� and a handgun, the shooting also stoked the debate over gun control. Obama has long and sometimes tearfully expressed his frustrations at trying to push reforms through Congress. He has described the 2012 shooting of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Connecticut, as the worst day of his presidency.
In her statement, Clinton said: �쏻e need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.��
NBC News said it had contacted Mateen�셲 father, Mir Seddique, who said: �쏻e are saying we are apologising for the whole incident. We weren�셳 aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country. This had nothing to do with religion.��
NBC News also reported Mateen�셲 father as saying his son reacted angrily a couple of months ago when he saw two men kissing in Miami. The Washington Post reported Mateen�셲 ex-wife said he was violent and mentally unstable and beat her repeatedly while they were married.
�쏦e was not a stable person,�� the newspaper�셲 website quoted her as saying. �쏦e beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn�셳 finished or something like that.��
America�셲 worst mass shooting unfolded over three terrifying hours at the Pulse nightclub, which was celebrating Latin Night. A drag queen from Puerto Rico was scheduled to perform, after Orlando�셲 25th Gay Days festival. The shooting began at about 2am. Anthony Torres was about to leave. �쏧t seemed fake,�� he later wrote on social media. �쏷his had to be planned.��
Torres wrote that he saw people �쐓creaming and running, looking for their loved ones�� and saw other �쐇njured people sitting on the floor��. He and his boyfriend, sister and friends ducked out the door.
A police officer outside the club moved to confront the gunman, the Orlando police chief, John Mina, told reporters on Sunday. The officer drew the gunman outside on to Orange Avenue, where they exchanged fire. Then the shooter re-entered the club and started firing again.
A survivor, Christopher Hansen, mistook the first sounds of discharge to be part of the DJ�셲 set. �쏽ou think you hear a song, it�셲 music, and then you realize no, it�셲 not, it�셲 real life, there�셲 somebody actually shooting,�� he told a reporter outside the club. �쏧t�셲 not OK. It�셲 not.��
He added that he knew the gunman must have had more than a handgun: there were too many shots. He fired dozens of rounds.
Staff at Pulse posted on Facebook: �쏣veryone get out of pulse and keep running.��
Outside, more than 100 personnel congregated, including officers from departments and agencies around central Florida, Swat teams, FBI agents and a bomb squad with dogs.
Inside, people scattered. Some hid in bathrooms. A local station, WFTV, broadcast several texts to family members. A mother recounted a text from her daughter and two nieces: �쒋�쁏lease come and get us. Please come and get us now. They�셱e shooting. They�셱e shooting.�쇺��
�쏦e�셲 coming,�� a man wrote in another. �쏦e�셲 in the bathroom with us.��
Eventually, the police made contact with the gunman, who had taken hostages. Mina declined to describe those talks on Sunday morning. The standoff lasted for hours. A mother, Mina Justice, said her son texted her.
�쏦e said: �쁇e has us, and he�셲 going to kill us,�� and that was it.��
Another mother, Lilbia Carmen, appealed for news on Facebook.
�쏯othing yet. My daughter is in there. Please keep praying for them,�� she wrote. �쏶he�셲 waiting for cops to be able to come out. I was on the [phone] and all I hear is shot guns.��
Carmen�셲 daughter escaped the carnage. The children of dozens of other parents did not.
At about 5am the police and FBI decided they could not wait any longer. �쏰ur biggest concern was further loss of life,�� Mina later told reporters.
Two loud explosions startled the press and survivors still within earshot of the club �� two controlled blasts �쐔o distract the suspect and gain that advantage��, Mina said. Then an armoured Bearcat truck smashed through a bathroom wall to free people while nine officers stormed the building, beginning a new battle with the shooter.
The gunman struck one of the officers with a bullet, but the man was saved by his Kevlar helmet, Mina said. The shooter was shot dead and about 30 people were rescued.
In addition to the weapons, police found a suspicious device on the suspect�셲 body. A bomb-defusing robot rolled inside, and they found the object was not explosive.
But the death toll surpassed authorities�� worst fears. They had estimated about 20 people killed at an initial briefing. After entering the club, they found 30 more bodies, 50 in all, and many more in dire condition, marking a death toll without precedent.
Later on Sunday, a 27-year-old man, who did not want to be named, showed reporters a bloody scratch across his stomach where he said a bullet had grazed him. The man said he had been standing at the bar, paying his bill, when the shooting started. He was carried across the bar by the weight of others rushing to escape, he said, and ended up underneath a pile of people.
When he was able to look up, he said, he saw about 20 bodies apparently dead or badly wounded on the floor around him.
Later, at police headquarters, people waited for news of loved ones. Brian Vieoma had been texting and calling his brother Luis�� cellphone since his family learned about the shooting. He had no reply and now feared the worst.
�쏦e came over for Latin Night. Venezuelans love to go dancing,�� Vieoma said of his 22-year-old brother.
Dyer declared a state of emergency, and alongside Mina, Hopper and a local imam urged Americans to give blood and unite. He told WESH-TV: �쏧t�셲 a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. My heart goes out to the victims, their families. But we�셱e a strong, resilient community.��
Dyer, who has been mayor of Orlando for 14 years, said he had �쐍ever seen anything like this. I hope no mayor ever has to see anything like this��.
Michael Cheatham, a surgeon with Orlando Health, told the press briefing local hospitals had implemented a �쐌ass casualty plan�� and spent the morning operating on a number of victims, �쐌any of them critically ill as a result of their injuries��. Blood banks in the Orlando area were straining under the effort to take in donors, the Orlando Sentinel reported, as hundreds come out to give for the victims.
The mayhem came in the month that Americans celebrate gay pride. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign �� the country�셲 biggest LGBT rights organisation �� said: �쏻e are devastated by this tragic act of violence, which has reportedly claimed the lives of at least 50 LGBTQ people and allies and injured more than 50 others.
�쏻e are grieving for the victims and our hearts are broken for their friends, families, and for the entire community. This tragedy has occurred as our community celebrates pride, and now more than ever we must come together as a nation to affirm that love conquers hate.��
Democrats ended a 14-hour filibuster in the Senate overnight with the promise of some progress on proposed gun control legislation. Republicans leaders agreed to take a vote on amendments to expand background checks and ban gun sales to those who are on the government�셲 terror watch list, closing what is known as the �쐔error gap��.
It�셲 unknown how Republicans would vote on the proposals. But in the wake of the nightclub shootings in Orlando, a small handful of them in the Senate are now showing greater willingness to compromise on the terror proposal than they did last December, when rival measures from the two parties to close the terror gap in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting both failed.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the White House, is scheduled to talk to the NRA on Thursday to help formulate his own policy position on the so-called terror gap �� a not-so-subtle acknowledgement of the extraordinary power that the gun lobby wields over legislators and candidates for high office alike. Here�셲 what you need to know about the terror gap.
The terror gap is the notion of a legislative hole whereby US citizens can purchase deadly firearms even if they are under investigation for suspected terrorist activity. The Government Accountability Office found that between 2004 and 2014, some 91% of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy a gun �� 2,043 out of 2,233 �� succeeded.
Attempts to close the gap, going back to the George W Bush administration, have repeatedly failed despite broad public support because of pressure on congressional legislators from the NRA.
Not entirely. The Bush and Obama administrations have both supported the same set of proposals, and the legislation most hotly contested by the NRA has been proposed jointly by Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democratic senator, and Peter King of New York, a Republican congressman. That said, Republicans tend to be in lockstep with the NRA more consistently than Democrats. Fifty-four senators voted against the Feinstein-King legislation last December, 53 of whom were Republicans. Just one Republican, Mark Kirk of Illinois, voted in favor.
The FBI has different ways of categorizing people it is investigating for possible terrorist ties. In addition, there is a federal no-fly list of people deemed too dangerous to be allowed to board an airplane. Some in the Senate, including Republican Pat Toomey, want to create a single consolidated list and have it subject to the authority of the foreign intelligence surveillance, or Fisa, court.
Feinstein and King want to give the Department of Justice, which includes the FBI, sole discretion over which terrorist suspects get to purchase weapons and which do not �� in part so that the FBI has the option of allowing sales to go ahead as part of their investigative process. Anyone who feels unfairly targeted would still have a chance to appeal against any denial of gun rights in the courts.
The NRA�셲 preferred approach, currently championed in the Senate by Republican John Cornyn, would require the government to respond to a contested gun sale by filing a brief in federal court, offering the targeted individual the opportunity to make his or her case in response, and convincing the judge to rule within 72 hours. Without fulfilling all of these conditions, the sale would go ahead. The president of Michael Bloomberg�셲 group Everytown for Gun Safety said this week: �쏷he Cornyn bill has an absurdly high standard that applies only to people who are proven to be about to commit a terrorist act. At that point, we shouldn�셳 be debating about terrorists�� gun rights �� just about the quickest way to incapacitate them.��
Among those seeking a compromise is Toomey, a Republican facing re-election in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He wants to address concerns about government overreach leading to people being put on a list erroneously by consolidating the many different ways the FBI has of tracking terror suspects, as well as the federal no-fly list, and putting it under the authority of the Fisa court.
Detractors on the left and the right are worried that a list of terror suspects used to curtail individual liberties would be prone to abuse and inadequate constitutional safeguards. The no-fly list has come under fire for exactly this criticism. Many people have not been informed that they are on the list, making it difficult or impossible to get themselves removed, and many others have not been given a reason for their inclusion. The American Civil Liberties Union is engaged in a five-year-old legal battle to challenge the constitutionality of the no-fly list and would accept it as a basis for denying individual gun rights only �쐗ith major reforms��.
The NRA, for its part, cites the risk of governmental overreach as a cornerstone of its argument for subjecting any contested gun purchase to the scrutiny of a judge. In principle, the NRA says it wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists, but in practice it has set almost impossibly high bars to making this happen.
Probably not. The Feinstein-King legislation as written last December would not have covered Omar Mateen because the FBI twice put him on a list of suspected terrorists and then took him off again. They now have new language, tailored to the events in Orlando, to extend a weapons purchase ban for five years after an individual is put on a terrorism suspect list.
Of course, there are many other ways to obtain an assault rifle and a machine pistol such as the weapons used at the Pulse nightclub than by going into a gun store �� for example, at a gun show, where there are no background checks. Another bill that will now go up for a vote to require background checks at gun shows is much less likely to pass.
Slightly, but don�셳 hold your breath. Senators such as Toomey and Rob Portman of Ohio, also facing re-election this year, are indicating an interest in finding compromise language. Feinstein, however, said on Wednesday that her own efforts to find a middle ground were not working. �쏧 don�셳 think it�셲 going to work out,�� she said.
Because, as Ari Freilich, a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, put it: �쏷he NRA sets the term of the debate.�� That applies even to a presidential candidate who famously claims to be beholden to nobody. The NRA has endorsed Trump, and Trump is doing what many, many other NRA endorsees have done before him.
The government and media have blown the Islamist terrorism threat out of proportion, giving extremists publicity that is counter-productive, a former head of Britain's intelligence service has said.
Sir Richard Dearlove, chief of MI6 at the time of the Iraq invasion, said that Britons spreading "blood-curdling" messages on the internet should be ignored. He told an audience in London on Monday there had been a fundamental change in the nature of Islamist extremism since the Arab spring. It had created a major political problem in the Middle East but the west, including Britain, was only "marginally affected".
Unlike the threat posed by al-Qaida before and in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks 13 years ago, the west was not the main target of the radical fundamentalism that created Isis, (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), Dearlove said.
Addressing the Royal United Services Institute, the London-based security and defence thinktank, he said the conflict was "essentially one of Muslim on Muslim".
He made it clear he believed the way the British government and the media were giving the extremists the "oxygen of publicity" was counter-productive. The media were making monsters of "misguided young men, rather pathetic figures" who were getting coverage "more than their wildest dreams", said Dearlove, adding: "It is surely better to ignore them."
The former MI6 chief, now master of Pembroke College, Cambridge University, was speaking to a prepared text hours after the ITV programme Good Morning Britain broadcast an interview with a Briton who had appeared in an Isis video saying he was recruited through the internet and was prepared to die for his cause.
Abdul Raqib Amin, who was brought up in Aberdeen, appeared in an online video last month with two men from Cardiff urging western Muslims to join the fighting with Isis. He told Good Morning Britain: "I left the UK to fight for the sake of Allah, to give everything I have for the sake of Allah. One of the happiest moments in my life was when the plane took off from Gatwick airport. I was so happy, as a Muslim you cannot live in the country of kuffars [non-believers]."
Amin added: "I left the house with the intention not to go back, I'm going to stay and fight until the khilafah [rule of Islam] is established or I die."
Dearlove said he was concerned about the influence of the media on the government's security policy. It was time to take what he called a "more proportionate approach to terrorism".
MI5, MI6, and GCHQ devoted a greater share of their resources to countering Islamist fundamentalism than they did to the Soviet Union during the cold war, or to Irish terrorism that had cost the lives of more UK citizens and British soldiers than al-Qaida had done, Dearlove noted.
A massive reaction after the 9/11 attacks was inevitable, he said, but it was not inevitable the 2001 attacks would continue to "dominate our way of thinking about national security". There had been a "fundamental change" in the nature of the threat posed by Islamist extremists. Al-Qaida had largely failed to mount the kind of attacks in the US and UK it had threatened after 9/11.
It was time, he said to move away from the "distortion" of the post-9/11 mindset, make "realistic risk assessments" and think rationally about the causes of the crisis in the Middle East.
The al-Qaida franchises that had emerged since had largely "fallen back" on other Muslim countries, Dearlove said. What was happening now was a long-awaited war between Sunni and Shia Muslims that would have only a ripple effect on Britain, he suggested.
Pointing the finger at Sunni Saudi Arabia, Dearlove said the Isis surge in Iraq had to be the consequence of "sustained funding".
He made it clear he believed more attention should be paid to security threats from Europe and China, which he warned was heading inexorably into the paradox of a "strong government but weak state".
Britain is facing a level of threat from Islamic State militants not seen since the IRA bombings of the 1970s, according to Britain�셲 new terror chief.
Max Hill, one of the country�셲 leading terrorism prosecutors, warned that Islamist extremists were planning �쐇ndiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians�� on a scale similar to those staged more than 40 years ago by the IRA.
The warning comes just days after Hill, who helped to convict the failed July 2005 London suicide bombers, was named as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, replacing David Anderson.
In his first interview since securing the post, Hill said militants were targeting cities and posed �쏿n enormous ongoing risk, which none of us can ignore��.
He told the Sunday Telegraph: �쏧n terms of the threat that�셲 represented, I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning �� with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas �� represents an enormous ongoing risk that none of us can ignore.��
He went on: �쏶o I think there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk that is at least as great as the threat to London in the 70s.��
The IRA abandoned its armed struggle for an end to British control of Northern Ireland and unification with Ireland in a 1998 peace deal.
More than 3,600 people were killed, including at least 1,000 members of the British security forces, during the sectarian conflict that began in the late 1960s.
British security officials have repeatedly said that Isis militants, who are losing ground in Iraq and Syria, will target the UK.
While Hill compared the severity of the threat they posed to the risks Britain faced in the dark days of the IRA, he said it would be wrong to �쐂raw a simple conclusion between Irish republicanism and the ideology of so-called Islamic State��.
Hill, who was praised by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, for his �쐗ealth of experience and legal expertise�� following his recent appointment, also expressed fears about the imminent return of hundreds of British jihadis who have been fighting for Isis in Syria.
He said: �쏧t�셲 an enormous concern that large numbers �� we know this means at least hundreds of British extremists who have left this country in order to fight �� are now returning or may be about to return.��
Last October, senior Obama officials anonymously unveiled to the Washington Post their newly minted "disposition matrix", a complex computer system that will be used to determine how a terrorist suspect will be "disposed of": indefinite detention, prosecution in a real court, assassination-by-CIA-drones, etc. Their rationale for why this was needed now, a full 12 years after the 9/11 attack:
On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on whether the statutory basis for this "war" - the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) - should be revised (meaning: expanded). This is how Wired's Spencer Ackerman (soon to be the Guardian US's national security editor) described the most significant exchange:
That the Obama administration is now repeatedly declaring that the "war on terror" will last at least another decade (or two) is vastly more significant than all three of this week's big media controversies (Benghazi, IRS, and AP/DOJ) combined. The military historian Andrew Bacevich has spent years warning that US policy planners have adopted an explicit doctrine of "endless war". Obama officials, despite repeatedly boasting that they have delivered permanently crippling blows to al-Qaida, are now, as clearly as the English language permits, openly declaring this to be so.
It is hard to resist the conclusion that this war has no purpose other than its own eternal perpetuation. This war is not a means to any end but rather is the end in itself. Not only is it the end itself, but it is also its own fuel: it is precisely this endless war - justified in the name of stopping the threat of terrorism - that is the single greatest cause of that threat.
In January, former Pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson delivered a highly-touted speech suggesting that the war on terror will eventually end; he advocated that outcome, arguing:
In response, I wrote that the "war on terror" cannot and will not end on its own for two reasons: (1) it is designed by its very terms to be permanent, incapable of ending, since the war itself ironically ensures that there will never come a time when people stop wanting to bring violence back to the US (the operational definition of "terrorism"), and (2) the nation's most powerful political and economic factions reap a bonanza of benefits from its continuation. Whatever else is true, it is now beyond doubt that ending this war is the last thing on the mind of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner and those who work at the highest levels of his administration. Is there any way they can make that clearer beyond declaring that it will continue for "at least" another 10-20 years?
The genius of America's endless war machine is that, learning from the unplesantness of the Vietnam war protests, it has rendered the costs of war largely invisible. That is accomplished by heaping all of the fighting burden on a tiny and mostly economically marginalized faction of the population, by using sterile, mechanized instruments to deliver the violence, and by suppressing any real discussion in establishment media circles of America's innocent victims and the worldwide anti-American rage that generates.
Though rarely visible, the costs are nonetheless gargantuan. Just in financial terms, as Americans are told they must sacrifice Social Security and Medicare benefits and place their children in a crumbling educational system, the Pentagon remains the world's largest employer and continues to militarily outspend the rest of the world by a significant margin. The mythology of the Reagan presidency is that he induced the collapse of the Soviet Union by luring it into unsustainable military spending and wars: should there come a point when we think about applying that lesson to ourselves?
Then there are the threats to Americans' security. Having their government spend decades proudly touting itself as "A Nation at War" and bringing horrific violence to the world is certain to prompt more and more people to want to attack Americans, as the US government itself claims took place just recently in Boston (and as clearly took place multiple other times over the last several years).
And then there's the most intangible yet most significant cost: each year of endless war that passes further normalizes the endless rights erosions justified in its name. The second term of the Bush administration and first five years of the Obama presidency have been devoted to codifying and institutionalizing the vast and unchecked powers that are typically vested in leaders in the name of war. Those powers of secrecy, indefinite detention, mass surveillance, and due-process-free assassination are not going anywhere. They are now permanent fixtures not only in the US political system but, worse, in American political culture.
Each year that passes, millions of young Americans come of age having spent their entire lives, literally, with these powers and this climate fixed in place: to them, there is nothing radical or aberrational about any of it. The post-9/11 era is all they have been trained to know. That is how a state of permanent war not only devastates its foreign targets but also degrades the population of the nation that prosecutes it.
This war will end only once Americans realize the vast and multi-faceted costs they are bearing so that the nation's political elites can be empowered and its oligarchs can further prosper. But Washington clearly has no fear that such realizations are imminent. They are moving in the other direction: aggressively planning how to further entrench and expand this war.
One might think that if there is to be a debate over the 12-year-old AUMF, it would be about repealing it. Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who heroically cast the only vote against it when it was originally enacted by presciently warning of how abused it would be, has been advocating its repeal for some time now in favor of using reasonable security measures to defend against such threats and standard law enforcement measures to punish them (which have proven far more effective than military solutions). But just as happened in 2001, neither she nor her warnings are deemed sufficiently Serious even to consider, let alone embrace.
Instead, the Washington AUMF "debate" recognizes only two positions: (1) Congress should codify expanded powers for the administration to fight a wider war beyond what the 2001 AUMF provides (that's the argument recently made by the supreme war-cheerleaders-from-a-safe-distance at the Washington Post editorial page and their favorite war-justifying think tank theorists, and the one being made by many Senators from both parties), or (2) the administration does not need any expanded authority because it is already free to wage a global war with very few limits under the warped "interpretation" of the AUMF which both the Bush and Obama DOJs have successfully persuaded courts to accept (that's the Obama administration's position). In other words, the shared premise is that the US government must continue to wage unlimited, permanent war, and the only debate is whether that should happen under a new law or the old one.
Just to convey a sense for how degraded is this Washington "debate": Obama officials at yesterday's Senate hearing repeatedly insisted that this "war" is already one without geographical limits and without any real conceptual constraints. The AUMF's war power, they said, "stretches from Boston to the [tribal areas of Pakistan]" and can be used "anywhere around the world, including inside Syria, where the rebel Nusra Front recently allied itself with al-Qaida's Iraq affiliate, or even what Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called 'boots on the ground in Congo'". The acting general counsel of the Pentagon said it even "authorized war against al-Qaida's associated forces in Mali, Libya and Syria". Newly elected independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said after listening to how the Obama administration interprets its war powers under the AUMF:
Former Bush DOJ official Jack Goldsmith, who testified at the hearing, summarized what was said after it was over: Obama officials argued that "they had domestic authority to use force in Mali, Syria, Libya, and Congo, against Islamist terrorist threats there"; that "they were actively considering emerging threats and stated that it was possible they would need to return to Congress for new authorities against those threats but did not at present need new authorities"; that "the conflict authorized by the AUMF was not nearly over"; and that "several members of the Committee were surprised by the breadth of DOD's interpretation of the AUMF." Conveying the dark irony of America's war machine, seemingly lifted right out of the Cold War era film Dr. Strangelove, Goldsmith added:
Nobody really even knows with whom the US is at war, or where. Everyone just knows that it is vital that it continue in unlimited form indefinitely.
In response to that, the only real movement in Congress is to think about how to enact a new law to expand the authorization even further. But it's a worthless and illusory debate, affecting nothing other than the pretexts and symbols used to justify what will, in all cases, be a permanent and limitless war. The Washington AUMF debate is about nothing other than whether more fig leafs are needed to make it all pretty and legal.
The Obama administration already claims the power to wage endless and boundless war, in virtually total secrecy, and without a single meaningful check or constraint. No institution with any power disputes this. To the contrary, the only ones which exert real influence - Congress, the courts, the establishment media, the plutocratic class - clearly favor its continuation and only think about how further to enable it. That will continue unless and until Americans begin to realize just what a mammoth price they're paying for this ongoing splurge of war spending and endless aggression.
Although I'm no fan of mindless partisan hackery, one must acknowledge, if one is to be honest, that sometimes it produces high comedy of the type few other afflictions are capable of producing.
On a related note: when Attorney General Eric Holder spoke about the DOJ's subpoeans for AP's phone records - purportedly issued in order to find the source for AP's story about a successfully thwarted terror attack from Yemen - he made this claim about the leak they were investigating: "if not the most serious, it is within the top two or three most serious leaks that I have ever seen." But yesterday, the Washington Post reported that CIA officials gave the go-ahead to AP to report the story, based in part on the fact that the administration itself planned to make a formal announcement boasting of their success in thwarting the plot. Meanwhile, the invaluable Marcy Wheeler today makes a strong case that the Obama administration engaged in a fear-mongering campaign over this plot that they knew at the time was false - all for the purpose of justifying the president's newly announced "signature drone strikes" in Yemen.
The key lesson from all of this should have been learned long ago: nothing is less reliable than unchecked claims from political officials that their secret conduct is justified by National Security Threats and the desire to Keep Us Safe.

A mock terrorist attack has been carried out at one of the UK�셲 busiest shopping centres, in a marauding assault similar to the Paris and Brussels atrocities.
More than 800 volunteers took part in the staged attack at the Trafford Centre in Manchester on Monday night.
As part of the drill a fake suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a packed food court at the shopping centre.
The volunteers, wearing ear defenders and safety glasses, screamed out as if they were in pain as the training exercise unfolded.
A second masked gunman then appeared at the entrance to the food court and fired a number of blank rounds.
Media organisations were then taken outside to witness the arrival, five minutes later, of armed police.
Two police marksmen moved towards the mock terrorist, ignoring the injured in a new tactic to save lives outlined by Scotland Yard following a similar training exercise in December.
The Trafford Centre mock attack, five months in the planning, then continued in the media�셲 absence until 6am.
Greater Manchester police sought to reassure people that there is no specific intelligence of an attack on the shopping centre, six miles west of Manchester city centre:
The shopping centre will be open as usual on Tuesday, although the training exercise is due to continue unseen at unnamed locations until Wednesday, when it will finish in Merseyside.
Counter-terror officers have stepped up their planning for a marauding-style terror attack following the atrocities in Paris last year and Brussels in March.
In Brussels, 32 people were killed and more than 300 injured when three suicide bombers detonated explosives in the airport and Maelbeek metro station.
In November last year, 130 people were killed when three suicide bombers struck near the Stade de France in St-Denis, Paris, followed by suicide bombings and mass shootings at cafes, restaurants and the Bataclan music venue.
Three terror attacks in three months have left the British security services desperately searching for ways to prevent another atrocity being committed in our streets.
But the frightening reality is that terrorism has become impossible to police. The attacks in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge were carried out by extremists who had nothing in common apart from a view of the world that places the murder of innocent people at the heart of a warped ideology. Their different ages, ethnicities and social backgrounds demonstrate the size of the task now facing counter-terrorism agencies in this country.
The Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, a Muslim convert in his early 50s, had for many years lived a relatively stable life in the home counties. Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi, a 24-year-old Mancunian, had fought on the frontline in Libya; while London Bridge ringleader Khuram Butt, a 27-year-old from east London, was an extremist living so much in plain view that he had featured in a Channel 4 documentary on extremism.
These men were all born or raised in Britain and radicalised in very different ways. Although Scotland Yard and MI5 were aware of them, there is no evidence that the men ever knew each other. Their circumstances comprise such a wide spectrum of behaviour, associations and life histories that they do not fit a straightforward terrorist profile.
Of urgent concern for the security services is understanding why Masood, Abedi, Butt and the third London Bridge attacker, Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian, were all known to them but were not stopped.
The answer is that the security services were �� and are �� drowning in the sheer volume of police reports, intelligence and referrals from members of the public.
Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command, MI5 and GCHQ share a database of 23,000 subjects of interest. Of these, they have prioritised 3,000 who they believe pose the greatest threat. Under MI5�셲 traffic-light system, a further 500 are given the highest priority and are being investigated as part of ongoing counter-terrorism operations.
But the security services must also혻contend with tens of thousands of혻other혻names that have been brought혻�벬쟯r should have been brought �벬쟴o their혻attention, including 3,000-4,000 arrests and many more who have been stopped and questioned by the police.
There are people who may have, from혻time to time, expressed extremist views, which in turn have led to referrals혻to the Prevent programme (8,000 in the last year) or the anti-terror hotline. Some referrals may include reports of an individual�셲 support on social media for a caliphate, or a desire to live in a country ruled by sharia law. Other reports may include references to conversations where someone has said they believe Muslims혻have the right to defend themselves혻with violence when they are attacked, or혻that Israel has no right to exist.
The security services and Prevent teams are inundated with these kinds of referrals, all of which must be investigated. At the same time police and MI5 officers are already committed to hundreds of counter-terror investigations and inquiries. MI5 must try to assess which of the thousands of cases matching the government�셲 fluid definition of extremism deserve resources.
In essence, they are trying to establish the crucial moment when a nonviolent view of the world turns to thoughts혻of terrorism. The easier cases are those that exhibit a criminal profile: attempting to obtain weapons, buying explosives ingredients or evidence of attack planning. And these are indeed the clues that have led to 18 terror plots since 2013 being thwarted, including five in the last two months.
But the dumbed-down terror attacks of Westminster and London Bridge are examples where there may be just days between planning and execution.
Khuram Butt illustrates exactly how difficult the science of terrorist detection has become: even when someone gleefully advertises their extremism, the police still need intelligence of attack planning before they can act.
There are hundreds of young men like Butt who express extremist views but stay on the right side of the law. Butt had been risk-assessed but dismissed because he had not shown any interest in domestic terrorism. Perhaps the police were beguiled by the belief that members of groups such as Anjem Choudary�셲 al-Muhajiroun, or those following the Islamist clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, observed a �쐁ovenant of security��, whereby Islamists living in the UK vow not to carry out acts of domestic terrorism.
Theresa May�셲 plans for tougher control orders, longer prison sentences or human rights-busting deportations would not have stopped any of the recent terror attacks. These measures all require intelligence that demonstrates that an individual poses a threat. None of the recent killers had been assessed in such a way, and so were not subjects of interest placed under surveillance.
Years of counter-terrorism policies directed against Islamic communities have made young Muslims deeply suspicious of the police. It is unfortunate but true that before each of the major terror attacks committed in the UK since and including the 7/7 London bombings, the security services had knowledge of, or even dealings with, at least one of the suspects. In each case it was a lack of hard intelligence that혻left혻the men unhindered to carry out their killings. It is vital that resources are now혻directed at mending the broken links in the vital chain of intelligence that flows from the community to the authorities.
The three terrorists who struck London Bridge last Saturday tried to hire a 7.5-tonne lorry on the morning of the attack to kill even more people and inflict a bigger atrocity on Britain.
Early on Saturday morning police investigating the attack made raids in east London and arrested two more people on suspicion of terror offences, bringing the number being held to seven. A 27-year-old man was detained at a house in Ilford and a 28-year-old man at a house in Barking.
Five other people were already in custody as detectives and MI5 investigate if anyone assisted the London Bridge terrorists or had knowledge of their plans go run people over and go on a stabbing rampage. Eight people were killed and 48 wounded in the attack.
The van they used was hired by the ringleader, named by police as Khuram Butt. Police believe the intended atrocity was on a similar scale to that in Nice, France, in August 2016 when a truck drove into a crowd and left 86 people dead.
The attempted truck hire failed only by chance, because Butt failed to provide payment details. Instead they hired a Renault van from a firm in Harold Hill, Romford, in east London.
Commander Dean Haydon, of Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command, said: �쏞oncerningly, Butt had earlier attempted to hire a 7.5-tonne lorry that same morning. When he did not provide payment details, the rental did not go ahead. The effects could have been even worse.��
Scotland Yard gave their fullest detail yet of the attack last Saturday, the third to strike Britain in three months, amid debate about tougher measures, impacting on civil liberties, to protect the United Kingdom against an unprecedented terrorism threat.
The attackers drove to London Bridge at 9.58pm. They drove up and down twice as a practice run, or by way of reconnaissance, before U-turning and then mowing down people in the van, driven by Butt. Three people were killed there, with one, French tourist Xavier Thomas, knocked into the river Thames as he walked with his girlfriend on a summer evening.
The trio then took knives they had bought, tied to their wrists with leather straps. All three had the same type of pink 12-inch kitchen knife with a ceramic blade. After crashing their hired van into railings, they first went off on their own to attack people, then regrouped to rampage through Borough market.
They had wrapped water bottles in grey tape to look like a suicide belt, strung around their upper bodies. As they set upon a young man passing by, armed police rushed towards the terrorists to save him. The police opened fire and killed the attackers in a hail of 46 bullets. At least two officers came under direct attack from the jihadis.
Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were all killed by police. One passerby was shot in the head by a police bullet.
Three people died after being hit by the van and five were stabbed to death in the attack led by Butt.
In the van police found 13 wine bottles containing flammable liquid with rags stuffed in them, essentially Molotov cocktails, and blow torches to ignite them, potentially meant for another wave of attacks. There were also bags of gravel, chairs and a suitcase meant to hide their murderous intent if the rental company or friends asked why they had hired a van.
The counter-terrorism command believes an east London flat rented since April by Redouane was the safe house where they prepared their attack. Detectives recovered craft knives from the flat used to cut the leather straps attached to the knives, lighter fluid used in the petrol bombs and other materials linking it directly to the attack.
Butt had been investigated by MI5 in 2015 but slipped off their radar after they found no evidence of attack planning or any crime. He was an acolyte of Anjem Choudary, an extremist cleric whose groups were believed by security officials to be a gateway to terrorism, with MI5 assessing that 500 people linked to them went on to commit terrorist acts.
Haydon said he expected more arrests and searches as the inquiry continued against a backdrop of unprecedented attack planning and terrorist threat level.
Haydon said his teams were working flat out: �쏻e also need to watch out for those who may be inspired by these recent attacks.�� He asked firms to report people they are suspicious of who are trying to hire vehicles or trucks for �쐍o particular reason��.
He said the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was a trigger factor for the upsurge, and it ends in just over a fortnight.
The van used was booked out at 5.50pm on the evening of the attack, using a recently activated mobile phone bought by Butt, and was due to be returned at 10am the next morning.
It was picked up at 6.30pm and by 7.17pm it arrived at a Barking address used by Zaghba.
At 7.38pm the attackers left the address and drove from east London to just south of the centre of the capital.
By 9.58pm they drove north to south across London Bridge in the first of the two reconnaissance runs, and then started the attack. The first 999 call to police was at 10.08pm, with police having shot them dead eight minutes later.
At the time of the attack, Butt was on bail for a non-terrorist offence, of trying to defraud a bank. Police said the CPS has decided they would not prosecute him. He also had two cautions, one in 2008 for fraud, and one in 2010 for assault. The other two had no criminal record in the UK and inquiries found none in countries they had links to. In Zaghba�셲 case that was Italy where he lived and Morocco, in Redouane �셲 case that was Ireland as well as Morocco and Libya.
Extra protection against vehicle attacks are now being put on eight London bridges including at Westminster, Waterloo, Lambeth, Tower Bridge, Blackfriars and Vauxhall. Urgent security reviews are being carried out for all events, including summer music festivals.
Three teenage women have been arrested in connection with Thursday�셲 counter-terrorism raid in north London, in which another woman was shot and injured.
Two 18-year-olds and a 19-year-old were arrested on Monday morning in east London on suspicion of planning terror attacks, the Metropolitan police said. They are being held at a police station outside London.
The arrests were part of an �쐎ngoing intelligence-led operation��, police said.
Ten people have now been arrested under the Terrorism Act since Thursday evening, when armed police swooped on a terrace house on Harlesden Road, Willesden, shooting and injuring the 21-year-old woman and firing CS gas canisters.
That raid was carried out by elite counter-terrorism specialist firearms officers (CTSFO) and is believed to have been the first time the unit has opened fire during an operation. Dramatic footage filmed by witnesses showed armed officers in black pointing weapons at the upstairs window of the property.
The injured woman was arrested on Sunday immediately after being released from hospital, where she had spent two days recovering under police guard.
Witnesses said the injured woman, who was wearing a long dress and hijab, shouted at paramedics not to touch her body as she was treated at the scene. Although some media reports suggested the woman was pregnant, it is understood she is not.
Four people, one of whom was a 16-year-old boy, were arrested, including two people who returned to the house in the early hours of Friday morning. A man aged 21 was arrested nearby and a 43-year-old woman was arrested in Kent.
Speaking on Friday, deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu said the raids were in response to an active plot, adding that police had �쐁ontained the threats��.
On Saturday Westminster magistrates court extended the detention of those arrested to dates between 2 and 4 May.
One of those arrested is believed to be Mohamed Amoudi, 21, a British citizen of Yemeni origin who was deported from Turkey in 2015 and questioned on his return to the UK but released without any further action.
The former Queen Mary University student was arrested in Turkey in 2015 on suspicion of planning to cross the border into Syria alongside two 17-year-old schoolboys, the Times reported at the time. The three were arrested again on their return to the UK but released without charge.
Scotland Yard said the Willesden house had been �쐕nder observation by counter-terrorism officers as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation��, adding that the incident was not connected to the suspected attempted terrorist attack in Westminster earlier on Thursday.
Greater Manchester police have admitted that use of the phrase �쏛llahu Akbar�� was a planned part of a terror training exercise at one of the UK�셲 biggest shopping centres.
Police were criticised for explicitly linking the drill at the Trafford Centre in Manchester to Islam when a fake suicide bomber shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� before appearing to detonate a device. The phrase translates as �쏥od is greatest�� and is used in prayer by Muslims.
On Tuesday Asst Ch Con Garry Shewan apologised for the use of the phrase. On Wednesday police said they had always planned to use the phrase in the operation, which took five months to organise, and that it was not introduced by the individual playing the part of the terrorist.
More than 800 volunteers took part in the training exercise on Monday night, which was designed to be similar to the Paris and Brussels atrocities.
Shewan said on Tuesday: �쏤or the past 24 hours, GMP, along with other agencies, has been hosting a counter-terrorism training exercise based at the Trafford Centre, which began with a mock suicide bomber detonating a bomb inside the shopping centre.
�쏧t is a necessity for agencies, including the police, to train and prepare using exercises such as this, so that we would be in the best possible position to respond in the event that the unthinkable happened and an attack took place.��
He went on: �쏷he scenario for this exercise is based on a suicide attack by an extremist Daesh-style organisation and the scenario writers have centred the circumstances around previous similar attacks of this nature, mirroring details of past events to make the situation as real life as possible for all of those involved.
�쏦owever, on reflection, we acknowledge that it was unacceptable to use this religious phrase immediately before the mock suicide bombing, which so vocally linked this exercise with Islam. We recognise and apologise for the offence that this has caused.��
One of the people who complained, Siema Iqbal, a Manchester GP, tweeted to Greater Manchester police demanding an explanation for why the terrorist in the training exercise had to be Muslim.
Erinma Bell, another doctor, retweeted Iqbal, adding: �쏥ood question. We need to move away from stereotypes if we want to achieve real learning. A terrorist can be anyone.��
The Community Safety Forum, an anti-Islamophobia organisation, said: �쏷his sort of thing panders to stereotypes and further divides us. It will increase anti-Muslim hate crime.��
Tony Lloyd, the mayor of Greater Manchester and the area�셲 police and crime commissioner, said the simulated terror attack had been �쏿 very good exercise in preparing for a situation we never want to see but must be ready for��.
But he said it was frustrating that the operation had been �쐌arred by the ill-judged, unnecessary and unacceptable decision by organisers�� to have those playing the parts of terrorists shout the Islamic phrase. �쏧t didn�셳 add anything to the event, but has the potential to undermine the great community relations we have in Greater Manchester,�� he said.
The apology from Greater Manchester police provoked a backlash by some who saw it as overly politically correct. An editorial in the Sun newspaper described it as �쏿 gutless surrender to political correctness��.
It said: �쏞ops have been cowed by dim, dangerous idiots unable to admit the simple reality that Britain�셲 main security threat is from Islamist murderers. The staged assault was meant to be by �쁝 Daesh-style organisation��, another term for IS. Rightly so. Who else but IS and al-Qaeda pose us such a threat? In whose name do they claim to kill but Allah�셲?��
The drill �� the latest in a series of similar exercises across the country �� started at midnight in the food court when a man dressed in black walked in and shouted at the crowd. An explosion was heard and a masked gunman fired shots at volunteers, who were wearing ear defenders and safety glasses. Fake shoppers covered in fake blood screamed out as if they were in pain.
Neither the emergency services nor volunteers taking part knew the precise details of the scenario, called Exercise Winchester Accord. The drill lasted for six hours.
The shopping centre was open as usual on Tuesday, although the exercise was due to continue unseen and at unspecified locations until Wednesday, when it will finish in Merseyside.
It was Monday morning and Australia was winding down for Christmas.
There was a smattering of news around: some terrorism raids in north-west Sydney, the release of a business case for Victoria�셲 proposed East-West Link toll road and from Canberra, the release of treasurer Joe Hockey�셲 mid-year financial report.
Otherwise, Monday was a typical summer day �� hazy, warm and soporific, made for skipping off work early, lazy lunches, Christmas shopping or drinks with friends.
Then, at 9.44am, it all changed. A man who had been a customer in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, at the heart of the city�셲 business district, held a gun to the head of a worker. It was the beginning of a 16-hour siege, the aftershocks of which will be felt in Australia for some time to come.
The first anybody in the Lindt cafe knew something was wrong was when the manager of shop, Tori Johnson, had a gun pointed at him by customer Man Haron Monis.
Previously, Monis, 50, had been seated, talking with Johnson, the Monday-morning hubbub of the cafe all around them.
An 83-year-old former Wimbledon tennis player, John O�섳rien, was in the cafe after his annual visit to the eye doctor. At another table were Louisa Hope, 50, and her mother Robyn, 70. Both live outside Sydney, but were enjoying an overnight stay in the city and had come to the cafe as a Christmas treat.
Also in the cafe were two Indian-born software engineers �� Pushpendu Ghosh and Viswakanth Ankireddy, who were working on a project for nearby bank Westpac. Marcia Mikhael and Selina Win Pe, two more Westpac employees, were also customers.
Behind the counter were workers Joel Herat, Jarrod Hoffman, Harriette Denny, Fiona Ma, Elly Chen, Bae Jieun and supervisor Paolo Vassallo.
Scant attention was paid to Monis, who sat with a bag at his feet.
Then, almost without warning, Monis was standing.
He drew a gun �� which, although not confirmed by police, has been reported as either a short barrelled or sawn-off shotgun �� and bellowed at customers to stand with their hands up.
He screamed at them that he was a representative of Islamic State and that this was a terrorist attack.
He told them there were bombs in the building, and that they must do as he instructed. Monis locked the doors of the cafe and forced his hostages to stand still, their hands high in the air.
When a woman outside came to the automatic doors, banging on them to be let in, Monis waved the gun in her direction, a silent warning that no one was to come in �� or out.
The woman alerted police, who quickly surrounded the building. Martin Place, busy for a year-end Monday morning, was hastily evacuated.
News of an unusual situation, possibly an armed hold-up, was first broadcast to the wider world by a tweet from The Australian�셲 Chris Kenny at 9.52am. It said: �쏶cary situation Martin place �� cops clearing area �� woman says man may have shotgun.��
Guardian reporters checked the information with NSW police, who replied a �쐏olice operation was ongoing��.
Kenny added more detail, saying there were hostages with their arms against the window in the Lindt coffee shop. He had gone in for a takeaway coffee and narrowly missed being caught in the drama.
On the television, Channel 7 �� whose headquarters are across the road from the cafe �� were running a feed with commentary of the incident.
Morning Show hosts Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies were on the air as armed police began to gather in the background of their shot.
Guardian reporter Oliver Milman jumped in a cab from nearby Surry Hills to the scene in the CBD. Almost immediately, his taxi was nearly hit by an unmarked police car, its balaclava-wearing occupants agitated to get to the scene, forcing its way through the traffic.
Martin Place station was being evacuated and a police cordon was placed around the cafe.
Milman saw a female hostage pressed against the third window down from the door. Black-clad police were huddled against the wall, a position they�셝 keep for the next 15 hours or so.
Office buildings and shops were evacuated and onlookers gathered. Channel 7�셲 studios were evacuated. Journalist Mieke Buchan, a guest on The Morning Show, had been in the makeup room when she was evacuated. �쏧t looked like some sharp shooters went into the side door, and then police in protective gear basically came rushing in,�� she said.
Many evacuated office workers thought it was a bomb scare. Westpac, which had staff members trapped in the cafe, closed all 12 of its CBD branches.
Jorge Bonora stood alone on the Macquarie Street corner of Martin Place, as close as he could to the cafe where his fiancee, Harriette Denny, was.
Police came and went, asking Bonora for information about the layout of the cafe as he had worked on the renovations a while back. Bonora had the phone number for the cafe�셲 architect but no one had come to get it from him yet. In the meantime he fielded dozens of texts and calls from worried family and friends.
Lindt cafe worker Nathan Grivas was also at the scene. He arrived for his shift, tried the doors �� which were locked �� and then caught sight of the gunman and his terrified colleagues through the glass.
�쏷he doors were already shut, it all looked pretty dodgy. As soon as someone said gun, we got out. We called the cops and about a minute later all these guys on motorcycles arrived, so you realise it�셲 pretty serious,�� he told the Guardian. �쏧 was there for a bit because I had called the police and they wanted me to tell them the layout. I couldn�셳 be too much help because I only started on Friday. While I was there I saw a few of [my colleagues] up against the window with their hands up, I think one of them looked at me. He looked shocked. Lucky I didn�셳 start at nine.��
Meanwhile, the family of barrister Katrina Dawson were frantically trying to contact her via text. They had heard about the siege and were afraid she might be inside.
Dawson, who worked at nearby Eight Selbourne chambers, went to the cafe most days to buy hot chocolate.
On Monday she was accompanied by fellow barrister Julie Taylor. Stefan Balafoutis, another colleague, was also in the cafe.
As crowds and police gathered, suddenly the captive Lindt workers appeared at the windows holding up a flag.
The black flag with white writing hung in the window was initially mistaken by many for an Isis flag.
The pictures were broadcast instantaneously due to Channel 7�셲 live feed. This had turned from a siege at gunpoint to a possible terrorist attack. Rumours started to fly.
It turned out the flag was not an Isis flag. From the sliver of writing that could be made out in the early footage, it was identified correctly by some to be the Shahada �� the Islamic creed �쏷here is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God�� �� rendered in calligraphic Arabic. The message appears on the flag of Saudi Arabia, the al-Qaida linked group Jabhat al-Nusra, and the radical group Hizb ut-Tahrir.
Meanwhile, Muslim community leaders were talking. It had been a busy morning. At around 9am, a number of them had received phone calls from the counter-terror unit of the New South Wales police. They were called to a briefing in Bankstown, to be held an hour later, about an arrest earlier that morning of a suspect in an unrelated terror financing case. The meeting ended early as police learned of the Martin Place incident.
Ahmed Kilani, publisher of the website Muslim Village, was one of about 10 community representatives in the meeting room who remained behind, following the siege on TV.
He recalled the moment the unmistakable shahada flag flashed on screen. �쏧t was shock. Horror. Oh my goodness. This is our biggest nightmare coming to life,�� he told the Guardian.
�쏛nd then it was about, well, who is this guy? So we�셱e ringing around asking, �쁗ho is it?��, and people keep saying: �쁈 don�셳 know��.��
About an hour into the siege, hostage Harriette Denny, a barista at the cafe, rang her fiance Jorge Bonora. She told him that she loved him but couldn�셳 speak and then she hung up.
Bonora thought she must have managed to call him from upstairs where staff lockers were kept, and that she sounded scared.
Police were called over to where Bonora was standing. They suggested Bonora text Denny back. She replied later, saying much the same thing: she loved him and couldn�셳 wait to see him. She would text at least once more but gave no information about the ordeal.
�쏶he�셲 the sweetest person ever,�� Bonora told the Guardian. �쏶he took some of my old shoes and made me wash them and she gave them to a homeless guy. She just cares about everyone.��
A torrent of rumours swirled in those first heady hours. A bomb had been defused at Sydney Opera House. Two more had been planted in the city. Two more still were being toted by the gunman inside the cafe.
There was speculation that a police chase through city streets was a second gunman. It was unrelated to the siege, police said.
Sydney radio host Ray Hadley reported that there were terror raids in Lakemba, a suburb with a large Muslim population.
Citing Hadley, the rumours spread across social media. But the truth turned out to be more prosaic �� it was a pre-arranged police tour of a mosque. There were no raids.
And how many hostages were inside the cafe? It seemed no one knew. Estimates ranged from eight to 50, with dozens of figures in between.
In the panic, buildings were evacuated or closed, even some thousands of kilometres from the siege, including the Victorian parliament building and Lindt shops in other cities.
Screenshots from flight tracking websites flooded Twitter, showing masses of aircraft allegedly diverting from Sydney airport, claiming airspace above the city had been shut down. Mobile phone reception in the CBD would soon follow, some said on Twitter. These rumours worked their way into online mainstream media coverage and in those feverish early hours were reported in some places as fact.
Throughout the day, Monis forced his hostages to call media outlets around the country and act as his spokesperson.
They called newsrooms at radio station 2GB, TV stations Nine, Seven and Ten as well as News Corp Australia and the ABC, relaying Monis�셲 demands. Those on the receiving end of the calls reported hearing the gunman barking orders in the background. But all media had been requested by police not to go to air.
Channel Ten reported his demands, as well as the claim there were bombs in the city. Journalist Hugh Rimington said afterwards that police had not specifically asked them not to air the messages.
2GB�셲 radio presenter Ray Hadley took the call off air, but let listeners know that the hostages had been in touch. 2GB said the phone call had been verified by NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione, but asked about it at a press conference shortly afterwards Scipione would not confirm or deny it.
So what did Monis want? In exchange for an on-air live broadcast phone call with Tony Abbott, Monis was prepared to release five hostages.
In exchange for a public declaration from the government that his was an act of terror committed on behalf of Islamic State, he was prepared to release two more.
And for a black Isis flag he was prepared to release a final prisoner.
As the standoff dragged into the afternoon, Monis began to realise his message was not being heard.
Monis was spreading terror and fear amongst his captives. Some screamed, while others burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably. At least one hostage began to vomit in fear.
Monis became furious once he realised his messages were not being broadcast by media outlets.
�쏻e�셱e not getting out of here,�� one hostage said to another, �쐍one of us are. We are going to die here.��
When a hostage�셲 phone rang and was answered, Monis screamed: �쏡rop that phone!��
Monis was the only person holding a weapon in the cafe. But he realised he could not, alone, keep control of so many hostages.
�쏷he gunman was surrounding himself with the staff from Lindt,�� the Guardian was told by a hostage, �쐄orcing them to stand near him, he was using them to control the social media, to get his message out. He was directing them on what to do, who to call, what to say.
�쏷he other people, the older people, he pushed to the other side of the shop, he kept them there.��
The gunman was refusing to engage with police negotiators. Hours passed without a clue about his identity. According to sources, at around 1.30pm officers invited senior Muslim leaders to a south-west Sydney police station and distributed photographs of the assailant. Did anyone recognise him?
�쏧t could be Sheikh Haron,�� one finally said, referring to a notorious self-styled peace activist.
Police scrambled to compare the photographs to police videos from the previous day, when Haron, or Man Haron Monis, had checked in with police in line with his bail conditions. The pictures matched.
Superintendent John Reilly, commander of the NSW counter-terrorism special operations group, told the Guardian that around the same time, across the city, a number of Muslim and police sources were also coming to the conclusion that Monis was the gunman.
Nearby, Ahmed Kilani�셲 phone was ringing. �쏷his is going to sound really weird and strange,�� the officer on the other end of the line said. �쏝ut I want you to try to get me an Isis flag.��
Kilani said he was struck by the request, but not offended. �쏰ur relationship is so good with these guys, we discuss everything openly. So there was no embarrassment, nothing.��
Still, he had never actually seen an Isis flag in Australia. �쏮aybe we could make one up for you?�� he asked.
Reilly says the request for the Isis flag came �쐄airly early�� in the siege.
�쏪ust to have one on tap, we contacted community leaders. So they�셱e ringing around trying to find one for us,�� he said. �쏛nd eventually we were able to get one.��
Reilly said the flag was provided in �쐅ood faith�� that there would be no repercussions. �쏻e haven�셳 gone looking for the source of it. If we�셱e asking for something, we�셱e not going to persecute [the owner].��
In the afternoon, a coordinated area for families of the hostages was set up near St James�셲 station.
But even inside the dedicated support and information centre, relatives received news the same way the rest of the country did, watching or reading the news. Some would wander out to the street for a cigarette or fresh air.
The family of barrister Katrina Dawson decided not to say anything to her three young children, hoping that she would emerge from the ordeal unscathed.
For the first hour Bruce Herat, father of hostage Joel, was kept at police barricades without information.
�쏛bout two and a half hours later we were told that a special room was being set up [for the families] in the old criminal courthouse,�� Herat told Fairfax Media.
�쏻e were given very neutral information first at around 2pm on Monday. Looking back it was frustrating �� but they wanted to be able to deliver information efficiently, when all the families were gathered round, rather than having to repeat it a dozen times when each of the families arrived, so I can see the logic of it.��
In the cafe, the tension was horrific.
�쏷here was no reasoning with him, he was so angry,�� one hostage told the Guardian. �쏦e knew his message was not getting out, and he was getting angrier and angrier.��
There were moments, however, of calm and of conciliation. Hostages were allowed to take drinks of water, and one woman who had medication was given permission to take it.
When his captives asked to go to the toilet, Monis deputised a member of the cafe staff �� themselves hostages �� to escort them, and bring them back to the shop.
But as the afternoon dragged on, Monis, grew more erratic and unpredictable. Hostages began to plead with their captor. Some begged to be released, pleading to see their families. Monis refused.
Hostages Stefan Balafoutis and John O�섳rien asked to go to the toilet, and, being escorted past the glass doors, asked the staff member pressed into being their sentry whether the green button at the base of the door would open it.
The staff member did not know. �쏧�셶e only worked here for about a week.��
It was 3.37pm, and the siege had run nearly six hours. The men decided to take their chances.
As Monis was focused on speaking to the people nearest to him, they ran for the front door, and pushed at the button.
The doors slid open, and they sprinted to safety.
Then a third, Lindt supervisor Paolo Vassallo, escaped through a fire door nearby.
The police were armed and in position �� as they had been since the siege begun around seven hours earlier.
Abruptly, two Lindt employees, Elly Chen and Bae Jieun 20, ran out of the cafe within seconds of each other. Bae Jieun was the first to escape. Distress etched on her face, she ran into the arms of a police officer. Elly followed seconds later.
Photographers were there to catch images which went around the globe �� they went on to become the faces of the Sydney siege.
The crowd had grown to about 400 but spectators had become more sedate. Nadia El-Mouelhy, who watched from the gutter, said she felt compelled to come to Martin Place to see if she could help. �쏧 feel so sorry for the people inside. This isn�셳 Islam, it�셲 stupid.��
Channel 7 journalist Chris Reason had been allowed back into the evacuated Martin Place newsroom. He and a cameraman were positioned next a police sniper, looking directly into the cafe. He said the hostages were being rotated near the window and food had been delivered to them.
Meanwhile on social media the hashtag #illridewithyou was gaining momentum both in Australia and overseas. Earlier in the day Michael James had tweeted a screenshot from the Facebook profile of a woman named Rachel Jacobs, who said she had seen a Muslim woman in Brisbane take off her hijab after news of the siege broke. At 4.28pm, Twitter user Tessa Kum built on Jacobs�셲 actions, offering to travel with any Muslims who felt unsafe wearing religious attire.�� A minute later, she tweeted: �쏮aybe start a hashtag? What�셲 in #illridewithyou?��
By 6pm it had been mentioned 90,000 times and was trending worldwide, with countless news outlets mentioning it as a bright spark of hope in a tragic day.
When it got dark Monis started handing out food to hostages but realised the cafe lights made him visible to those watching outside. He asked a woman to turn them off. Mike Bowers, a Guardian photographer stationed nearby, caught an image of a cafe worker in an apron turning off the light. All went dark.
�쏬ater on a dim light came on and you could see silhouettes,�� Bowers said.
It started getting cold, the winds racing through the empty canyons of Martin Place. As time passed the crowds dispersed, but the police remained in position.
Just after midnight, the first video from inside the Lindt cafe was uploaded to the internet. The clip, which looked as though it had been shot from a phone, featured a woman in front of the same Islamic flag that had been displayed from the window hours earlier.
Soon four videos had been uploaded. The speakers, all women, warned of bombs in the city that would be �쐇gnited�� if the hostage taker�셲 demands were not met.
�쏻e do not understand why these demands haven�셳 been met yet, they are not unreasonable. He is only asking for a flag and a phone call,�� one hostage said. She called the man �쐎ur brother��.
Hostage Joel Herat was forced to upload the videos through his Facebook and YouTube account.
Herat�셲 father told Fairfax: �쏧 felt somewhat cold when I saw those, thinking if [the gunman] is going to that resort, then obviously he is starting to target people as emotional conduits to get what he wanted. My concern then was how far would he go.��
Around 2am Monis became agitated and started moving hostages around in two groups. As Monis moved one group, the other group of seven made a dash for the door.
Bruce Herat said his son�셲 group of hostages decided to kick down an internal door and escape.
�쏤rom what Joel told me initially, towards 2am Monis started to bring groups of people together in close proximity from where they had been dispersed throughout [the cafe]��, Herat told Fairfax Media.
�쏛nd at that point in time, Joel and five others came to the conclusion that they were not going to survive until the morning if they did not do something. So I think him and Jarrod [Hoffman, another hostage] basically came to the conclusion that they would bust down the door. And I know that Joel made sure that Harriette [Denny] ... got behind him and he said, �쁚ou�셱e coming with me��, and basically made sure that all that group were ready to go when Joel and Jarrod broke down the door.��
The group was seen fleeing the building just minutes before heavily armed police stormed the cafe with flash grenades and live ammunition.
The gunfight was over in about 30 seconds, and from the cafe police and emergency officers emerged carrying injured hostages. Three were on stretchers and a fourth hostage was carried in the arms of two officers.
Louisa Hope, who had reportedly been used as a human shield by Monis when police entered, had been shot in the foot. Her mother was shot in her shoulder. Another woman was shot in the leg, while a police officer received a minor facial injury from a gun pellet.
Ambulance officers worked frantically, administering CPR on the sidewalk to barrister Katrina Dawson, a mother of three who had been shot. She was pronounced dead at hospital.
Tori Johnson, the cafe manager, was also killed during the siege, reportedly shot in the head by Monis.
Monis was the third person killed during the siege.
After six terrorist assaults on civilians in less than a fortnight, France and Germany are reeling from a series of shocks that, beyond the immediate fears and tensions they have sown, will increasingly test Europe�셲 liberal democratic order. Both countries are experiencing an unprecedented wave of violent acts just as they gear up for key elections next year. An already volatile, angst-ridden situation is amplified by a political context of rising populism and partisan point-scoring.
As France struggles to cope with the aftermath of the killing of Father Jacques Hamel in his church near Rouen, barely 24 hours after Germany had experienced its fourth assault in a single week, the sentiment is growing that life as people have known it is unravelling; and that the new normal may resemble a mixture of unpredictable, hidden dangers and a rush to large-scale security measures. In France, where attacks began in 2012, talk of �쐗ar�� with jihadi terrorism has become commonplace. There is a nationwide state of emergency. Germany neither talks of war, nor is there a state of emergency. But혻after Ansbach, the first Islamic State-claimed suicide bombing in Germany, the interior minister, Thomas de Maizi챔re, acknowledged that Germany too had become a target for international terrorism.
In the immediate aftermath of each attack, the question is always why it was not foiled. In France, security flaws are blamed. In혻Germany, the argument is about monitoring refugees. The questions swirl regardless of whether or not there is a connection with last year�셲 massive refugee movement into Europe, or with radical Islam.
In both France and Germany in the aftermath of attacks, political passions quickly flared; but it is France�셲 political cohesion that혻appears under the greater strain. France�셲 show of national unity after the 2015 attacks in Paris swiftly fell apart in the aftermath of the Nice attack. Fran챌ois Hollande is now struggling to defend his credibility and resist growing demands for heightened security measures. Some of his rightwing critics even call for a �쏤rench Guant찼namo��. Marine Le Pen�셲 far right Front National seized on Tuesday�셲 attack to say France�셲 �쏞hristian roots�� are in peril. Anti-immigrant hyperbole is rife. In Germany, political reactions are comparatively more subdued: Chancellor Angela Merkel�셲 popularity and authority remain strong. Her CSU Bavarian coalition partner wants stringent controls on migrants but, perhaps because its electoral prospects still hinge on the alliance with the chancellor�셲 CSU in the run-up to next year�셲 general election, it has avoided direct personal attacks on her. Germany�셲 far right has grown but it is still dwarfed by the French Front National. The anti-immigrant AfD party has prospered on a narrative of rejecting Muslims, but stumbled when it hastily and erroneously described the Munich attack as an act of jihadi fundamentalism.
Germany�셲 sense of its own history is a strong antidote against some of the more extremist tendencies currently at play in France. Where France�셲 political leadership has spoken more about the need to come out �쐖ictorious�� from a �쐗ar�� than about the tolerance and efforts needed to make diversity an asset rather than a problem, German officials have gone to great lengths to insist that terrorism should not be conflated with refugees or immigrants. Personal styles differ too: whereas Mr Hollande wants to appear combative and resolute against the �쐃nemy��, Mrs Merkel expresses empathy for the victims rather than a penchant for military-type measures.
Whatever the contrasts, in heated political contexts ahead of each nation�셲 2017 elections, the decisions and attitudes these leaders endorse will set an example for the whole of Europe. Two countries that already set the tone on many issues across a continent now scarred by hostility to refugees hover on the edge of deep, newly shared, uncertainties.
October 2002
Over a period of three weeks, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed 10 people and critically injured three others in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Virginia. The pair were also suspected of earlier shootings in Maryland, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, and Washington state. While their motives remain a mystery, evidence presented at the trial showed Muhammad and Malvo were in possession of images related to jihad.
March 2006
Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar injured six people when he drove an SUV into a group of pedestrians at UNC-Chapel Hill �쐔o avenge the deaths or murders of Muslims around the world��. He turned himself into police shortly after the attack. He pleaded guilty to nine counts of attempted first degree murder, and in 2008 was sentenced to 33 years in prison.
June 2009
Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and killed one soldier and injured another in a drive-by shooting at a military careers station in Little Rock, Arkansas. Muhammad, a convert to Islam, had visited Yemen for 16 months where he spent time in prison and became radicalised. He said he was part of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and was upset over the US killing Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2011 he pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
November 2009
Maj Nidal Malik Hasan of the US army opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 people and wounding at least 30. In 2013, Hasan was convicted by a military tribunal. He defended himself and took responsibility for the attack saying his motive was jihad, to fight �쐇llegal and immoral aggression against Muslims��. The US government has not called the shooting a terrorist attack, characterising it as one of �쐗orkplace violence��. Hasan was sentenced to death.
April 2013
Chechen brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev detonated two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. After the bombing, they shot and killed an MIT campus police officer while he was sitting in his squad car, before hijacking an SUV and fleeing to nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. A huge police chase ensued, resulting in a shootout during which several IED�셲 were thrown by the brothers.
Tamerlan was shot and killed at the scene. The younger Dzhokhar was later discovered inside a boat parked in a driveway less than three blocks away. He was taken into custody after another exchange of gunfire and arraigned on federal terrorism charges. A note written by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, on the boat where he was captured, said the bombings were in retaliation for US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan against Muslims. In 2015 he was found guilty on all 30 counts related to the bombing and shootout with police, and sentenced to death.
October 2014
Zale Thompson injured two NYPD Officers with an 18in hatchet on a crowded sidewalk in Queens. Four officers were posing for a photograph when Thompson charged them. They opened fire killing Thompson and injuring a civilian. Thompson, who converted to Islam two years before the attack, was a frequent visitor of websites that promoted jihad, but police said he had no ties to any international terror group.
May 2015
Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi opened fire outside a Muhammad art exhibit event at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas. The event featured the first inaugural �쐂raw the prophet�� contest. A Garland school district police officer was injured. Both gunmen were killed by police. Isis later claimed responsibility for the attack.
July 2015
Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Four Marines and one sailor were killed and a police officer was injured. Abdulazeez was killed by police in a gunfight following a high-speed chase. He was a naturalised US citizen born in Kuwait. The FBI has yet to determine whether it was an act of terrorism.
December 2015
Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 17 others. Farook had been at the centre for a Christmas party earlier but left following an argument. The pair fled in an SUV but were later killed by police. Bomb equipment, weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition were found in their home. The FBI said it was investigating the shootings as �쐆orrific acts of terrorism�� after it emerged the couple had apparent links to Isis.
Terror and Consent: The Wars for the Twenty-first Century
 by Philip Bobbitt
 688pp, Allen Lane, 짙25
George Bush's claim that we are involved in a war against terror has been widely ridiculed. At best, it was a politician's rhetorical flourish like the war against poverty or the war against drugs; at worst, it was a cynical device to justify interventionist wars overseas and encroachments on civil liberties at home.
Philip Bobbitt devotes more than 600 pages to arguing that the concept of a war against terror is historically, legally, politically and morally correct. His style is academically merciless: he starts by demolishing, in turn, 22 popular fallacies perpetrated by those who do not believe we are at war. But this is an important book by an influential American strategic thinker and must be taken seriously. His defence of the most famous Bushism contrasts with his evident contempt for the Bush administration itself (over Guant찼namo, torture, the conduct of the Iraq war, support for the Israeli incursion into Lebanon, the treatment of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and much else), and his views bear a striking similarity to those of the man who may well be the next US president, John McCain.
His central argument is that the war against terror (starting with the one against al-Qaida) is fundamentally different in character from earlier manifestations of terrorism: from the Jewish rebels against the Romans, Indian thuggees, and pirates of the Caribbean through to the Jacobins, the IRA and the PLO. The differences are two. One is that the new terrorism centres on the acquisition and eventual, deliberate, use of weapons of mass destruction to generate mass terror; 9/11 was, on this view, merely an hors d'oeuvre for a bigger meal to come. He reproduces detailed evidence and extrapolates from known facts to argue that the proliferation of WMD technology through the commercial networks of Pakistan's nuclear pioneer AQ Khan and others, and the systematic acquisition of this technology by al-Qaida, is much more of a threat than we like to believe. When we are being simultaneously warned about the horrors of climate change, water wars, energy wars, and other roads to Armageddon, the war against terror struggles to retain priority status, but Bobbitt makes a good case for it.
His second big idea is that modern terrorist organisations are a natural response to the end of the era of the nation state. The new terrorist groups, such as al-Qaida, mimic and are a product of the decentralised, outsourcing, privatised, globalised, networked world of what he calls the new market state. Market states are wealthier and offer more opportunities than traditional nation states. But they are more vulnerable, and part of their vulnerability lies in the "commodification" of and trade in weapons of mass destruction. The new terrorist groups know their enemy. They have no interest in national identity or territory; they have a "global" ideology; and their aim is to disable the market state by causing mass death and creating terror among civilian populations.
Bobbitt's policy prescriptions are ambitious, spanning a new approach to strategy, international relations and the rule of law. He argues for "preclusion", which is in part a posh new academic word for a pre-emptive strike. But preclusion goes way beyond armed intervention. He supported the Iraq war, but was scathing about its narrow, militarist execution and the failure to move quickly to protect civilians from a breakdown in law and order or to achieve early reconstruction. He wants to see intervention "by states of consent" to protect civilians from genocide in "states of terror" (he wanted the US to take a lead in Rwanda and Darfur) and also from the consequences of natural disasters, including climate change. There is much in his approach that a muscular "liberal interventionist" - such as Tony Blair or Paddy Ashdown - could feel at ease with. But he applies the same approach domestically, too. He writes scathingly about the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina; such demonstrations of anarchy, inhumanity and incompetence merely fortify the enemies of free societies and represent a defeat in the war on terror. Even those who share his prejudices about the Bush administration might feel, however, that this is taking the concept of the war on terror rather far.
He would go further: demilitarising the military, equipping it with skills for policing, reconstruction and non-lethal management of protest (including such wacky ideas as using large numbers of rubber balls for crowd control). Since the objective of the war on terror is to prevent civilian mass terror, there can be, almost by definition, no definitive victory or success beyond the continued demonstration of stability and security. No less important is an uncompromising defence of the rule of law, which is the bedrock of the "market state". For this reason, Guant찼namo, Abu Ghraib and illegal torture are treated as massively damaging own goals. He also insists that failure to treat the war on terror as a war has unintended damaging consequences. The victims of 9/11, for example, were compensated on the basis of tort: rich stockbrokers were paid much more than poor janitors, since their lost income stream was greater. A country at war would recognise the equality of sacrifice. In this argument he finds himself at odds with serious military historians, such as Sir Michael Howard, who worry that escalating al-Qaida terrorism from criminality to warfare risks confusing means and ends. Bobbitt's answer is that terrorism - on a wholly new scale - is both means and end.
The war on terror was a concept first proclaimed by a president who will be remembered for incompetence and intellectual laziness. We shouldn't assume, however, that it will disappear with him. Better presidents, Republican and Democrat, may well adopt it. If so, this book is the place to discover what the war on terror actually means.

My best friend died the other day. He and 21 other concert-goers were killed in the Manchester Arena by an individual to whom no attention should be paid. We cherish the memory of the victims and we mourn with their families.
Megan Hurley, Courtney Boyle, Philip Tron, Wendy Fawell, Elaine McIver, Eilidh MacLeod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Nell Jones, Michelle Kiss, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Kelly Brewster, Olivia Campbell, John Atkinson, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Saffie Rose Roussos, Georgina Callander and my dear friend Martyn Hett. Equally, we will remember the victims whose lives were taken callously on London Bridge and in Borough Market.
One person who offered condolences to the Manchester victims was King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and head of the autocratic Saud family that has ruled Saudi Arabia since the foundation of the modern state in 1932. He picked up the phone to his staunch ally Theresa May and, like many of the world�셲 leaders, condemned the attack and said he was committed to standing shoulder to shoulder with Britain in the war on terror.
There is no reason to believe his words were insincere. Saudi Arabia has, after all, fallen victim to terrorism countless times on its own soil. Yet, there is a story that�셲 not being told, touched upon briefly by Caroline Lucas in Wednesday�셲 televised general election debate. As Lucas underlined, the UK is the world�셲 second biggest arms dealer, and delivers its bombs and guns to 22 of the 30 countries on our government�셲 own human rights watch list.
It should come as no surprise that Saudi Arabia is high on that list with its repressive male guardianship system; its provisions for the imprisonment and execution of LGBT people; and its complete disregard for the freedoms of expression, association and belief. That�셲 before you even consider the Saudi-led bombing raids on Yemen, which the UN confirms have been the single biggest cause of the thousands of lives lost in the bloody conflict in the Arab world�셲 poorest country.The list of Saudi atrocities is long and the victims are too numerous to name. So why is it that British firms have sold 짙3bn worth of weapons to the Saudis in the past three years alone, while the British government continues to send an annual aid package to Yemen amounting to a fraction of that revenue? Our government�셲 support for the Al Saud family makes us complicit in mass murder. Sadly, in Wednesday�셲 debate, Theresa May was too busy to turn up and defend her government�셲 appalling record. When confronted about the issue, her foot soldier, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, merely shrugged: �쏧t�셲 good for industry.��
So what does all this have to do with the callous murder of 22 people in Manchester last week? Well, it requires us to look into the ideology that drove that sorry man to commit such an act. The Saudi-sponsored brand of Islam known as Wahhabism is widely considered to be the source of much extremist thought. In the words of the world�셲 largest Muslim youth organisation, it is characterised by antipathy �� at times violent �� towards Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and even other Sunni Muslims who do not share the Wahhabis�� rigid and authoritarian view of Islam.
�쏤or more than fifty years, Saudi Arabia has systematically propagated a supremacist, ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam among Sunni Muslim populations worldwide,�� read the official statement released by the Indonesian Muslim youth movement Gerakan Pemuda Ansor ,the day after my friend was killed. �쏷he Wahhabi/ultra-conservative view of Islam �� which is embraced not only by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but also by al-Qaida and Isis �� is intricately wedded to those elements of classical Islamic law that foster sectarian hatred and violence.��
I do not blame May or her government for the death of my friend, nor do I hold anyone responsible for the depraved act other than the perpetrator himself, but we must look at these things in context. To shrug off complicity in the killing of thousands of innocents for the sake of industry is, to my mind, criminal. To turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia�셲 aggressive propagation of an ultra-conservative version of Islam and its role in the radicalisation of young minds is equally incriminating.
While you might attack Jeremy Corbyn for his failure to recall a figure when pushed by Emma Barnett on Woman�셲 Hour, or for his policies, you cannot possibly fault him on the pledge to end the sale of arms to the kingdom after almost 60 years. On Thursday, it is with conviction that I will cast my vote for Labour, and for our best chance of a foreign policy to be proud of: one that does not just aim to cash in on arms deals regardless of the consequences, but one that makes trade deals conditional on the guarantee of universal human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
A week after the attack, I returned to my workplace and knew I had to leave my job. Enough. When I signed up to a consulting job in public diplomacy for the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs I was unaware of what I was taking on, but 18 long months of compromising my morals have taken their toll.The experience will haunt me: my complicity in extolling the virtues of Saudi Arabia�셲 baby steps towards gender equality, in extending Saudi commiserations over the deaths of young gay people in the Orlando bombing, in offering explanations for the bloody war in Yemen. The fact that it took the murder of my closest friend to take the leap into the dark is unfortunate, but in the few days since I have felt nothing but relief at the prospect of an unfettered future. Be more Martyn.
Theresa May has had a torrid political March on several fronts, but she has a valuable gift for calm and a knack of catching the public mood at moments like the aftermath of the attack on Wednesday afternoon in central London. In a statement to MPs today, Mrs May successfully combined dignity with emotion as she paid tribute to the police officer PC Keith Palmer, who was killed protecting parliament by the man later named as Khalid Masood. She maintained a proportionate and reasoned tone as she discussed the details of the emergency and the fast and courageous response to it. Masood�셲 hired 4x4, in its murderous career across Westminster Bridge, killed a tourist and a teacher and one other who has not yet been named. It injured up to 40 others.
Every MP who spoke in the Commons caught the prime minister�셲 mood. All were at pains to emphasise the need for solidarity. All took care to distinguish between the overwhelming majority of British Muslims and the handful of individuals inspired by Islamic State and similar groups who have been responsible for most of the recent terror attacks and plots in Europe (but not all: Jo Cox�셲 murderer was a white supremacist).
It was notable that the prime minister also resisted the temptation to reach for new legislation. There was no talk of extra powers for the security services. But in the wings is a plan, dating from her time as home secretary, for a strengthened version of the counter-terror Prevent strategy. Prevent was introduced four years ago in a bid to identify and tackle radicalism; more than 8,000 people have been referred for possible inclusion in the programme. But it is distrusted in Muslim communities and has been criticised by both the Commons home affairs committee and David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who fear it is regarded as a spying programme. They want it redirected towards community engagement.
Away from Westminster, there was an exception to the attempt to return to business as usual. In total disregard of their ignorance of the facts at the time, the Ukip leader Paul Nuttall and his predecessor, Nigel Farage, renewed their baseless and disgraceful campaign to drive a wedge between Muslims혻and non-Muslims in Britain.
Only hours after the attack, Mr Farage took혻to US television to bind the terror attack with immigration policy. He recycled an old Daily Mail story about Labour �쐓ending out search parties�� for migrant workers. He asserted that there was an undefined �쐄ifth column�� at work in Europe which was혻the result of uncontrolled immigration. He claimed the attack justified Donald Trump�셲 attempts to ban Muslims from some혻Middle혻Eastern countries.
What Mr Farage said was quite unconnected with reality. But he has added a little more alloy to the coin of political debate. His rush to blame multiculturalism contributes to an atmosphere where some feel licensed to express hatred �� witness the vicious social media spat over an apparently frightened young woman in a hijab looking the other way as she walked by one of the injured. Some of what he said has been picked up and given prominence in mainstream media.
The inconvenient truth for these cynics is that Masood was born and grew up here, and although he had convictions for violence as a young man it appears he was not considered a risk by the security services. Experts believe even Isis, which now claims him as a soldier of Islam, did not know the attack was coming. The best chance of detecting such threats is likely to be from sources within the Muslim community. That surely means promoting engagement, not surveillance.
NHS hospital trauma units have been put on standby to deal with a potential fresh terrorist attack, possibly happening as soon as this weekend. The NHS has told every hospital in England, including the 27 that are specialist trauma centres, to �쐏repare for a further incident��.
Surgical teams must be ready to treat people who have been caught up in a bomb blast or hit by shrapnel as part of the measures triggered by the nationwide alert status being raised to critical.It is the first time since the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 that NHS hospital trusts have been told to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale terrorist attack.The message to the 27 trauma centres has come from Chris Moran, a surgeon and professor, who is NHS England�셲 national clinical director for trauma.Moran said in the message: �쏷he trauma community in Manchester has provided a tremendous response to the atrocity on Monday night and this is a credit to their dedication and clinical skills, and also the preparation that has taken place.
�쏽ou will be aware that we have a bank holiday weekend approaching. There are a number of things that all trauma units and major trauma centres can do to prepare for a further incident and I should be grateful if you could disseminate these within your network so that frontline clinicians are aware.��
The Health Service Journal, which obtained Moran�셲 message, reported: �쏷he message advised surgical teams to prepare for the consequences of attacks by reviewing the early management of patients with blast and ballistic injuries, as well as advice on dealing with infections and use of antibiotics.�쒷HS England said that all NHS trusts should be taking precautionary measures in the wake of the Manchester bombing.
A spokesman said: �쏶ince the [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre] has announced the threat level has changed from severe to critical, this triggers longstanding, tried and tested NHS protocols reflected in this letter, which reminds NHS organisations of the precautionary measures they need to take ensure care is in place should it be needed.��
In a separate letter to trusts, Anne Rainsberry, NHS England�셲 national incident director, advised them to review their staffing levels and supplies of blood and equipment, as well as patients who could be discharged quickly to free up beds in case an incident occurred.
Meanwhile, some of the 75 people still in hospital after being injured in Monday�셲 bombing have �쐋ife-changing injuries��, and 23 remain in critical care, the NHS has confirmed. They include many lower limb injuries and wounds caused by the nuts and bolts which were added to the bomb.
�쏷he NHS and care organisations together with partners across the voluntary sector will be providing care and support for individuals in the weeks, months and years to come. Some individuals will now have life-changing injuries which will require the support of the NHS and partners for a long time��, said Jon Rouse, chief officer of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership.
In all 116 people were injured in the attack, almost double the 59 initially reported. Of those, 75 are still being treated in eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. However, the NHS said that the fact that 23 people were in a critical care unit did not mean that all were critically ill.
Dr Chris Moulton, the vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: �쏯HS emergency departments are well prepared for the possibility of a further terrorist attack, as has been demonstrated by the effective and well-coordinated response in Greater Manchester.
�쏣ach locality has its own well-rehearsed plan for similar situations. Emergency care staff work under great pressure at the best of times, but, in the event of a major incident, will always demonstrate skill, commitment and compassion. We are confident that, should such a terrible scenario occur again, the NHS and its staff will rise to meet the challenge.��
A new Gallup poll released Monday morning has a surprising finding: a majority of Americans - while supporting air strikes in foreign countries against foreign nationals suspected of Terrorism - oppose such air strikes when used to target US citizens who are suspected Terrorists, whether at home or on foreign soil:
The reason this is surprising is that when the US actually killed a US citizen on foreign soil on the grounds that he was a suspected Terrorist - Anwar al-Awlaki - large majorities approved. One poll at the time reported that "a large proportion of Americans believe the US Government made the correct decision in killing a US born Islamist militant in a drone strike last month" - specifically, that "69 per cent of respondents think the action taken by the US Government to kill Anwar al-Awlaki was justified" (that included 77% Republicans and 73% Democrats approving). Another poll at the time reported that Obama's approval ratings on national security increased eight points in the wake of the Awlaki killing. Meanwhile, Obama aides ran to Politico to boast that Awlaki's corpse would be a significant asset in Obama's re-election bid, leading to this Politico headline:
What can explain this obvious discrepancy? How can it be that a policy which a majority of Americans oppose (killing Americans on foreign soil on the grounds of suspected Terrorism) was so popular and politically beneficial for Obama when it was actually done to Awlaki? I'm not speaking here about those who support the US Government's right to kill US citizens on foreign soil without a trial: people who believe that and support the Awlaki execution are at least being consistent. I'm focusing here on how it can be that a majority of Americans say they oppose having Americans so targeted on foreign soil yet still support the Awlaki killing.
There are several possible factors explaining this discrepancy. It is probably easier to oppose such killings when considered in the abstract than it is when asked specifically about a person like Awlaki who had been subjected to such an intense government and media demonization campaign. It's also possible that intervening events between these polls - particularly the Rand Paul filibuster - created unprecedented media debate about the dangers of Obama's claimed assassination powers and caused people to re-think their wisdom (that was the ground cited by the ACLU's Laura Murphy when she praised Paul's protest: "As a result of Sen. Paul's historic filibuster, civil liberties got two wins: . . . Americans learned about the breathtakingly broad claims of executive authority undergirding the Obama administration's vast killing program").
But it seems clear there is a much more odious factor driving some of this. Many Americans can (a) say that they oppose the targeted killings of Americans on foreign soil while simultaneously (b) supporting the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen because, for them, the term "Americans" doesn't include people like Anwar al-Awlaki. "Americans" means their aunts and uncles, their nice neighbors down the street, and anyone else who looks like them, who looks and seems "American". They don't think those people - Americans - should be killed without charges by the US government if they travel on vacation to Paris or go to study for a semester in London. But the concept of "Americans" most definitely does not include people with foreign and Muslim-ish names like "Anwar al-Awlaki" who wear the white robes of a Muslim imam and spend time in a place like Yemen.
Legally - which is the only way that matters for this question - the New-Mexico-born Awlaki was every bit as much of an American citizen as the nice couple down the street. His citizenship was never legally revoked. He never formally renounced it. He was never charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime that could lead to the revocation of citizenship. No court ever considered revoking his citizenship, let alone did so. From a legal and constitutional perspective, there was not a single person "more American" than he. That's because those gradations of citizenship do not exist. One is either an American citizen or one is not. There is no such thing as "more American" or "less American", nor can one's citizenship be revoked by presidential decree. This does not exist.
But the effort to depict Muslims as something other than "real Americans" has long been a centerpiece of the US political climate in the era of the War on Terror. When it was first revealed in 2005 that the Bush administration was spying on the communications of Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, a Bush White House spokesman sought to assure everyone that this wasn't targeting Real Americans, but only those Bad Ones that should be surveilled (meaning Muslims the Bush administration decided, without due process, were guilty):
Identically, when the Israelis attacked the Mavi Marmara flotilla in 2010 and killed 9 people including the US-born teenager Furkan Dogan, some conservatives insisted that he was not a Real American because his parents were Turkish and he grew up in Turkey ("it is silly to call him an 'American of Turkish descent'. He, like the other members of his family, was a Turk"). The stark contrast in reactions between the sustained fury of the Turkish government over the killing of their citizens by the Israelis versus the support for those killings given by the US government was accounted for in part by the blind US support for whatever Israel does (including killing Americans), but also by the belief that Dogan wasn't really an American, not the Real Kind you get upset about when a foreign army kills them.
This decade-long Othering of Muslims - a process necessary to sustain public support for their continuous killing, imprisonment, and various forms of rights abridgments - has taken its toll. I'm most certainly not suggesting that anyone who supports Awlaki's killing is driven by racism or anti-Muslim bigotry. I am suggesting that the belief that Muslims are somehow less American, or even less human, is widespread, and is a substantial factor in explaining the discrepancy I began by identifying.
Does anyone doubt that if Obama's bombs were killing nice white British teeangers or smiling blond Swiss infants - rather than unnamed Yemenis, Pakistanis, Afghans and Somalis - that the reaction to this sustained killing would be drastically different? Does anyone doubt that if his overhead buzzing drones were terrorizing Western European nations rather than predominantly Muslim ones, the horror of them would be much easier to grasp?
Does it really take any debate to know that if the 16-year-old American suspiciously killed by the US government two weeks after killing his father had been Jimmy Martin in Sweden rather than Abdulrahman al-Awlaki in Yemen, the media interest and public outcry would be far more substantial, and Robert Gibbs would have been widely scorned if he had offered this vile blame-the-victim justification for killing Jimmy rather than Abdulrahman? It is indisputably true that - just as conservatives argued that Furkan Dogan was not a Real American - large numbers of Americans believe the same about the Denver-born teenager named Abdulrahman. This ugly mindset is not the only factor that leads the US public to support more than a decade of US killing and rights abridgments aimed primarily at Muslims, including their fellow citizens, but it is certainly a significant one.
Amazingly, some Democratic partisans, in order to belittle these injustices, like to claim that only those who enjoy the luxury of racial and socioeconomic privilege would care so much about these issues. That claim is supremely ironic. It reverses reality. That type of privilege is not what leads one to care about and work against these injustices. To the contrary, it's exactly that privilege that causes one to dismiss concerns over these injustices and mock and scorn those who work against them. The people who insist that these abuses are insignificant and get too much attention are not the ones affected by them, because they're not Muslim, and thus do not care.
The perception that the state violence, rights abridgments and expansions of government power ushered in by the War on Terror affect only Muslims long ago stopped being true. But ensuring that people continue to believe that is the key reason why it has been permitted to continue for so long.
The New Jersey Star Ledger this morning has an excellent interview with CUNY Professor Diala Shamas, who just co-authored a new report on the devastating impact of the NYPD's shockingly invasive and indsicriminate surveillance program aimed at Muslim communities in New York and New Jersey. She documents in particular how this type of surveillance, aimed at innocent Muslims, creates an intense climate of fear and chills political speech. Would anyone tolerate having such sweeping surveillance programs infiltrating Jewish or Christian communities in the US? I once asked this question of leading New York Mayoral candidate Christine Quinn, who supports the NYPD program, and she refused to answer). But the answer is obvious: of course not. That is the point.
The ACLU's Jameel Jaffer perfectly summarizes the point I am making from those polls:
At around 8pm on Sunday 29 January, a young man walked into a mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood of Quebec City and opened fire on worshippers with a 9mm handgun. The imam had just finished leading the congregation in prayer when the intruder started shooting at them. He killed six and injured 19 more. The dead included an IT specialist employed by the city council, a grocer, and a science professor.
The suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette, a 27-year-old student, has been charged with six counts of murder, though not terrorism. Within hours of the attack, Ralph Goodale, the Canadian minister for public safety, described the killer as �쏿 lone wolf��. His statement was rapidly picked up by the world�셲 media.
Goodale�셲 statement came as no surprise. In early 2017, well into the second decade of the most intense wave of international terrorism since the 1970s, the lone wolf has, for many observers, come to represent the most urgent security threat faced by the west. The term, which describes an individual actor who strikes alone and is not affiliated with any larger group, is now widely used by politicians, journalists, security officials and the general public. It is used for Islamic militant attackers and, as the shooting in Quebec shows, for killers with other ideological motivations. Within hours of the news breaking of an attack on pedestrians and a policeman in central London last week, it was used to describe the 52-year-old British convert responsible. Yet few beyond the esoteric world of terrorism analysis appear to give this almost ubiquitous term much thought.
Terrorism has changed dramatically in recent years. Attacks by groups with defined chains of command have become rarer, as the prevalence of terrorist networks, autonomous cells, and, in rare cases, individuals, has grown. This evolution has prompted a search for a new vocabulary, as it should. The label that seems to have been decided on is �쐋one wolves��. They are, we have been repeatedly told, �쏷error enemy No 1��.
Yet using the term as liberally as we do is a mistake. Labels frame the way we see the world, and thus influence attitudes and eventually policies. Using the wrong words to describe problems that we need to understand distorts public perceptions, as well as the decisions taken by our leaders. Lazy talk of �쐋one wolves�� obscures the real nature of the threat against us, and makes us all less safe.
The image of the lone wolf who splits from the pack has been a staple of popular culture since the 19th century, cropping up in stories about empire and exploration from British India to the wild west. From 1914 onwards, the term was popularised by a bestselling series of crime novels and films centred upon a criminal-turned-good-guy nicknamed Lone Wolf. Around that time, it also began to appear in US law enforcement circles and newspapers. In April 1925, the New York Times reported on a man who �쏿ssumed the title of �쁋one Wolf�쇺��, who terrorised women in a Boston apartment building. But it would be many decades before the term came to be associated with terrorism.
In the 1960s and 1970s, waves of rightwing and leftwing terrorism struck the US and western Europe. It was often hard to tell who was responsible: hierarchical groups, diffuse networks or individuals effectively operating alone. Still, the majority of actors belonged to organisations modelled on existing military or revolutionary groups. Lone actors were seen as eccentric oddities, not as the primary threat.
The modern concept of lone-wolf terrorism was developed by rightwing extremists in the US. In 1983, at a time when far-right organisations were coming under immense pressure from the FBI, a white nationalist named Louis Beam published a manifesto that called for �쐋eaderless resistance�� to the US government. Beam, who was a member of both the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations group, was not the first extremist to elaborate the strategy, but he is one of the best known. He told his followers that only a movement based on �쐖ery small or even one-man cells of resistance �� could combat the most powerful government on earth��.
Experts still argue over how much impact the thinking of Beam and other like-minded white supremacists had on rightwing extremists in the US. Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people with a bomb directed at a government office in Oklahoma City in 1995, is sometimes cited as an example of someone inspired by their ideas. But McVeigh had told others of his plans, had an accomplice, and had been involved for many years with rightwing militia groups. McVeigh may have thought of himself as a lone wolf, but he was not one.
One far-right figure who made explicit use of the term lone wolf was Tom Metzger, the leader of White Aryan Resistance, a group based in Indiana. Metzger is thought to have authored, or at least published on his website, a call to arms entitled �쏬aws for the Lone Wolf��. �쏧 am preparing for the coming War. I am ready when the line is crossed �� I am the underground Insurgent fighter and independent. I am in your neighborhoods, schools, police departments, bars, coffee shops, malls, etc. I am, The Lone Wolf!,�� it reads.
From the mid-1990s onwards, as Metzger�셲 ideas began to spread, the number of hate crimes committed by self-styled �쐋eaderless�� rightwing extremists rose. In 1998, the FBI launched Operation Lone Wolf against a small group of white supremacists on the US west coast. A year later, Alex Curtis, a young, influential rightwing extremist and protege of Metzger, told his hundreds of followers in an email that �쐋one wolves who are smart and commit to action in a cold-mannered way can accomplish virtually any task before them ... We are already too far along to try to educate the white masses and we cannot worry about [their] reaction to lone wolf/small cell strikes.��
The same year, the New York Times published a long article on the new threat headlined �쏯ew Face of Terror Crimes: �쁋one Wolf�� Weaned on Hate��. This seems to have been the moment when the idea of terrorist �쐋one wolves�� began to migrate from rightwing extremist circles, and the law enforcement officials monitoring them, to the mainstream. In court on charges of hate crimes in 2000, Curtis was described by prosecutors as an advocate of lone-wolf terrorism.
When, more than a decade later, the term finally became a part of the everyday vocabulary of millions of people, it was in a dramatically different context.
After 9/11, lone-wolf terrorism suddenly seemed like a distraction from more serious threats. The 19 men who carried out the attacks were jihadis who had been hand picked, trained, equipped and funded by Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, and a small group of close associates.
Although 9/11 was far from a typical terrorist attack, it quickly came to dominate thinking about the threat from Islamic militants. Security services built up organograms of terrorist groups. Analysts focused on individual terrorists only insofar as they were connected to bigger entities. Personal relations �� particularly friendships based on shared ambitions and battlefield experiences, as well as tribal or familial links �� were mistaken for institutional ones, formally connecting individuals to organisations and placing them under a chain of command.
This approach suited the institutions and individuals tasked with carrying out the �쐗ar on terror��. For prosecutors, who were working with outdated legislation, proving membership of a terrorist group was often the only way to secure convictions of individuals planning violence. For a number of governments around the world �� Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt �� linking attacks on their soil to �쏿l-Qaida�� became a way to shift attention away from their own brutality, corruption and incompetence, and to gain diplomatic or material benefits from Washington. For some officials in Washington, linking terrorist attacks to �쐓tate-sponsored�� groups became a convenient way to justify policies, such as the continuing isolation of Iran, or military interventions such as the invasion of Iraq. For many analysts and policymakers, who were heavily influenced by the conventional wisdom on terrorism inherited from the cold war, thinking in terms of hierarchical groups and state sponsors was comfortably familiar.
A final factor was more subtle. Attributing the new wave of violence to a single group not only obscured the deep, complex and troubling roots of Islamic militancy but also suggested the threat it posed would end when al-Qaida was finally eliminated. This was reassuring, both for decision-makers and the public.
By the middle of the decade, it was clear that this analysis was inadequate. Bombs in Bali, Istanbul and Mombasa were the work of centrally organised attackers, but the 2004 attack on trains in Madrid had been executed by a small network only tenuously connected to the al-Qaida senior leadership 4,000 miles away. For every operation like the 2005 bombings in London �� which was close to the model established by the 9/11 attacks �� there were more attacks that didn�셳 seem to have any direct link to Bin Laden, even if they might have been inspired by his ideology. There was growing evidence that the threat from Islamic militancy was evolving into something different, something closer to the �쐋eaderless resistance�� promoted by white supremacists two decades earlier.
As the 2000s drew to a close, attacks perpetrated by people who seemed to be acting alone began to outnumber all others. These events were less deadly than the spectacular strikes of a few years earlier, but the trend was alarming. In the UK in 2008, a convert to Islam with mental health problems attempted to blow up a restaurant in Exeter, though he injured no one but himself. In 2009, a US army major shot 13 dead in Fort Hood, Texas. In 2010, a female student stabbed an MP in London. None appeared, initially, to have any broader connections to the global jihadi movement.
In an attempt to understand how this new threat had developed, analysts raked through the growing body of texts posted online by jihadi thinkers. It seemed that one strategist had been particularly influential: a Syrian called Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, better known as Abu Musab al-Suri. In 2004, in a sprawling set of writings posted on an extremist website, Nasar had laid out a new strategy that was remarkably similar to �쐋eaderless resistance��, although there is no evidence that he knew of the thinking of men such as Beam or Metzger. Nasar�셲 maxim was �쏱rinciples, not organisations��. He envisaged individual attackers and cells, guided by texts published online, striking targets across the world.
Having identified this new threat, security officials, journalists and policymakers needed a new vocabulary to describe it. The rise of the term lone wolf wasn�셳 wholly unprecedented. In the aftermath of 9/11, the US had passed anti-terror legislation that included a so-called �쐋one wolf provision��. This made it possible to pursue terrorists who were members of groups based abroad but who were acting alone in the US. Yet this provision conformed to the prevailing idea that all terrorists belonged to bigger groups and acted on orders from their superiors. The stereotype of the lone wolf terrorist that dominates today�셲 media landscape was not yet fully formed.
It is hard to be exact about when things changed. By around 2006, a small number of analysts had begun to refer to lone-wolf attacks in the context of Islamic militancy, and Israeli officials were using the term to describe attacks by apparently solitary Palestinian attackers. Yet these were outliers. In researching this article, I called eight counter-terrorism officials active over the last decade to ask them when they had first heard references to lone-wolf terrorism. One said around 2008, three said 2009, three 2010 and one around 2011. �쏷he expression is what gave the concept traction,�� Richard Barrett, who held senior counter-terrorist positions in MI6, the British overseas intelligence service, and the UN through the period, told me. Before the rise of the lone wolf, security officials used phrases �� all equally flawed �� such as �쐆omegrowns��, �쐁leanskins��, �쐄reelancers�� or simply �쐕naffiliated��.
As successive jihadi plots were uncovered that did not appear to be linked to al-Qaida or other such groups, the term became more common. Between 2009 and 2012 it appears in around 300 articles in major English-language news publications each year, according the professional cuttings search engine Lexis Nexis. Since then, the term has become ubiquitous. In the 12 months before the London attack last week, the number of references to �쐋one wolves�� exceeded the total of those over the previous three years, topping 1,000.
Lone wolves are now apparently everywhere, stalking our streets, schools and airports. Yet, as with the tendency to attribute all terrorist attacks to al-Qaida a decade earlier, this is a dangerous simplification.
In March 2012, a 23-year-old petty criminal named Mohamed Merah went on a shooting spree �� a series of three attacks over a period of nine days �� in south-west France, killing seven people. Bernard Squarcini, head of the French domestic intelligence service, described Merah as a lone wolf. So did the interior ministry spokesman, and, inevitably, many journalists. A year later, Lee Rigby, an off-duty soldier, was run over and hacked to death in London. Once again, the two attackers were dubbed lone wolves by officials and the media. So, too, were Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013. The same label has been applied to more recent attackers, including the men who drove vehicles into crowds in Nice and Berlin last year, and in London last week.
One problem facing security services, politicians and the media is that instant analysis is difficult. It takes months to unravel the truth behind a major, or even minor, terrorist operation. The demand for information from a frightened public, relayed by a febrile news media, is intense. People seek quick, familiar explanations.
Yet many of the attacks that have been confidently identified as lone-wolf operations have turned out to be nothing of the sort. Very often, terrorists who are initially labelled lone wolves, have active links to established groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Merah, for instance, had recently travelled to Pakistan and been trained, albeit cursorily, by a jihadi group allied with al-Qaida. Merah was also linked to a network of local extremists, some of whom went on to carry out attacks in Libya, Iraq and Syria. Bernard Cazeneuve, who was then the French interior minister, later agreed that calling Merah a lone wolf had been a mistake.
If, in cases such as Merah�셲, the label of lone wolf is plainly incorrect, there are other, more subtle cases where it is still highly misleading. Another category of attackers, for instance, are those who strike alone, without guidance from formal terrorist organisations, but who have had face-to-face contact with loose networks of people who share extremist beliefs. The Exeter restaurant bomber, dismissed as an unstable loner, was actually in contact with a circle of local militant sympathisers before his attack. (They have never been identified.) The killers of Lee Rigby had been on the periphery of extremist movements in the UK for years, appearing at rallies of groups such as the now proscribed al-Muhajiroun, run by Anjem Choudary, a preacher convicted of terrorist offences in 2016 who is reported to have �쐇nspired�� up to 100 British militants.
A third category is made up of attackers who strike alone, after having had close contact online, rather than face-to-face, with extremist groups or individuals. A wave of attackers in France last year were, at first, wrongly seen as lone wolves �쐇nspired�� rather than commissioned by Isis. It soon emerged that the individuals involved, such as the two teenagers who killed a priest in front of his congregation in Normandy, had been recruited online by a senior Isis militant. In three recent incidents in Germany, all initially dubbed �쐋one-wolf attacks��, Isis militants actually used messaging apps to direct recruits in the minutes before they attacked. �쏱ray that I become a martyr,�� one attacker who assaulted passengers on a train with an axe and knife told his interlocutor. �쏧 am now waiting for the train.�� Then: �쏧 am starting now.��
Very often, what appear to be the clearest lone-wolf cases are revealed to be more complex. Even the strange case of the man who killed 86 people with a truck in Nice in July 2016 �� with his background of alcohol abuse, casual sex and lack of apparent interest in religion or radical ideologies �� may not be a true lone wolf. Eight of his friends and associates have been arrested and police are investigating his potential links to a broader network.
What research does show is that we may be more likely to find lone wolves among far-right extremists than among their jihadi counterparts. Though even in those cases, the term still conceals more than it reveals.
The murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, days before the EU referendum, by a 52-year-old called Thomas Mair, was the culmination of a steady intensification of rightwing extremist violence in the UK that had been largely ignored by the media and policymakers. According to police, on several occasions attackers came close to causing more casualties in a single operation than jihadis had ever inflicted. The closest call came in 2013 when Pavlo Lapshyn, a Ukrainian PhD student in the UK, planted a bomb outside a mosque in Tipton, West Midlands. Fortunately, Lapshyn had got his timings wrong and the congregation had yet to gather when the device exploded. Embedded in the trunks of trees surrounding the building, police found some of the 100 nails Lapshyn had added to the bomb to make it more lethal.
Lapshyn was a recent arrival, but the UK has produced numerous homegrown far-right extremists in recent years. One was Martyn Gilleard, who was sentenced to 16 years for terrorism and child pornography offences in 2008. When officers searched his home in Goole, East Yorkshire, they found knives, guns, machetes, swords, axes, bullets and four nail bombs. A year later, Ian Davison became the first Briton convicted under new legislation dealing with the production of chemical weapons. Davison was sentenced to 10 years in prison for manufacturing ricin, a lethal biological poison made from castor beans. His aim, the court heard, was �쐔he creation of an international Aryan group who would establish white supremacy in white countries��.
Lapshyn, Gilleard and Davison were each described as lone wolves by police officers, judges and journalists. Yet even a cursory survey of their individual stories undermines this description. Gilleard was the local branch organiser of a neo-Nazi group, while Davison founded the Aryan Strike Force, the members of which went on training days in Cumbria where they flew swastika flags.
Thomas Mair, who was also widely described as a lone wolf, does appear to have been an authentic loner, yet his involvement in rightwing extremism goes back decades. In May 1999, the National Alliance, a white-supremacist organisation in West Virginia, sent Mair manuals that explained how to construct bombs and assemble homemade pistols. Seventeen years later, when police raided his home after the murder, they found stacks of far-right literature, Nazi memorabilia and cuttings on Anders Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist who murdered 77 people in 2011.
Even Breivik himself, who has been called �쐔he deadliest lone-wolf attacker in [Europe�셲] history��, was not a true lone wolf. Prior to his arrest, Breivik had long been in contact with far-right organisations. A member of the English Defence League told the Telegraph that Breivik had been in regular contact with its members via Facebook, and had a �쐆ypnotic�� effect on them.
If such facts fit awkwardly with the commonly accepted idea of the lone wolf, they fit better with academic research that has shown that very few violent extremists act without letting others know what they may be planning. In the late 1990s, after realising that in most instances school shooters would reveal their intentions to close associates before acting, the FBI began to talk about �쐋eakage�� of critical information. By 2009, it had extended the concept to terrorist attacks, and found that �쐋eakage�� was identifiable in more than four-fifths of 80 ongoing cases they were investigating. Of these leaks, 95% were to friends, close relatives or authority figures.
More recent research has underlined the garrulous nature of violent extremists. In 2013, researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined the interactions of 119 lone-wolf terrorists from a wide variety of ideological and faith backgrounds. The academics found that, even though the terrorists launched their attacks alone, in 79% of cases others were aware of the individual�셲 extremist ideology, and in 64% of cases family and friends were aware of the individual�셲 intent to engage in terrorism-related activity. Another more recent survey found that 45% of Islamic militant cases talked about their inspiration and possible actions with family and friends. While only 18% of rightwing counterparts did, they were much more likely to �쐏ost telling indicators�� on the internet.
Few extremists remain without human contact, even if that contact is only found online. Last year, a team at the University of Miami studied 196 pro-Isis groups operating on social media during the first eight months of 2015. These groups had a combined total of more than 100,000 members. Researchers also found that pro-Isis individuals who were not in a group �� who they dubbed �쐎nline �쁫one wolf�� actors�� �� had either recently been in a group or soon went on to join one.
There is a much broader point here. Any terrorist, however socially or physically isolated, is still part of a broader movement. The lengthy manifesto that Breivik published hours before he started killing drew heavily on a dense ecosystem of far-right blogs, websites and writers. His ideas on strategy drew directly from the �쐋eaderless resistance�� school of Beam and others. Even his musical tastes were shaped by his ideology. He was, for example, a fan of Saga, a Swedish white nationalist singer, whose lyrics include lines about �쏷he greatest race to ever walk the earth �� betrayed��.
It is little different for Islamic militants, who emerge as often from the fertile and desperately depressing world of online jihadism �� with its execution videos, mythologised history, selectively read religious texts and Photoshopped pictures of alleged atrocities against Muslims �� as from organised groups that meet in person.
Terrorist violence of all kinds is directed against specific targets. These are not selected at random, nor are such attacks the products of a fevered and irrational imagination operating in complete isolation.
Just like the old idea that a single organisation, al-Qaida, was responsible for all Islamic terrorism, the rise of the lone-wolf paradigm is convenient for many different actors. First, there are the terrorists themselves. The notion that we are surrounded by anonymous lone wolves poised to strike at any time inspires fear and polarises the public. What could be more alarming and divisive than the idea that someone nearby �� perhaps a colleague, a neighbour, a fellow commuter �� might secretly be a lone wolf?
Terrorist groups also need to work constantly to motivate their activists. The idea of �쐋one wolves�� invests murderous attackers with a special status, even glamour. Breivik, for instance, congratulated himself in his manifesto for becoming a �쐓elf-financed and self-indoctrinated single individual attack cell��. Al-Qaida propaganda lauded the 2009 Fort Hood shooter as �쏿 pioneer, a trailblazer, and a role model who has opened a door, lit a path, and shown the way forward for every Muslim who finds himself among the unbelievers��.
The lone-wolf paradigm can be helpful for security services and policymakers, too, since the public assumes that lone wolves are difficult to catch. This would be justified if the popular image of the lone wolf as a solitary actor was accurate. But, as we have seen, this is rarely the case.
The reason that many attacks are not prevented is not because it was impossible to anticipate the perpetrator�셲 actions, but because someone screwed up. German law enforcement agencies were aware that the man who killed 12 in Berlin before Christmas was an Isis sympathiser and had talked about committing an attack. Repeated attempts to deport him had failed, stymied by bureaucracy, lack of resources and poor case preparation. In Britain, a parliamentary report into the killing of Lee Rigby identified a number of serious delays and potential missed opportunities to prevent it. Khalid Masood, the man who attacked Westminster last week, was identified in 2010 as a potential extremist by MI5.
But perhaps the most disquieting explanation for the ubiquity of the term is that it tells us something we want to believe. Yes, the terrorist threat now appears much more amorphous and unpredictable than ever before. At the same time, the idea that terrorists operate alone allows us to break the link between an act of violence and its ideological hinterland. It implies that the responsibility for an individual�셲 violent extremism lies solely with the individual themselves.
The truth is much more disturbing. Terrorism is not something you do by yourself, it is highly social. People become interested in ideas, ideologies and activities, even appalling ones, because other people are interested in them.
In his eulogy at the funeral of those killed in the mosque shooting in Quebec, the imam Hassan Guillet spoke of the alleged shooter. Over previous days details had emerged of the young man�셲 life. �쏛lexandre [Bissonette], before being a killer, was a victim himself,�� said Hassan. �쏝efore he planted his bullets in the heads of his victims, somebody planted ideas more dangerous than the bullets in his head. Unfortunately, day after day, week after week, month after month, certain politicians, and certain reporters and certain media, poisoned our atmosphere.
�쏻e did not want to see it ��. because we love this country, we love this society. We wanted our society to be perfect. We were like some parents who, when a neighbour tells them their kid is smoking or taking drugs, answers: �쁈 don�셳 believe it, my child is perfect.�� We don�셳 want to see it. And we didn�셳 see it, and it happened.��
�쏝ut,�� he went on to say, �쐔here was a certain malaise. Let us face it. Alexandre Bissonnette didn�셳 emerge from a vacuum.��

Especially for young men, mortal combat in the service of a great cause provides the ultimate adventure and maximum esteem in the eyes of many and, most dearly, in the hearts of their peers. One heroic cause for disaffected souls in the world today is jihad, through which anyone from anywhere can make a mark against the most powerful countries and armies in the history of the world. How glorious to cut off Goliath's head with a box cutter �� or at least cause him a big headache.
Yet, although many millions of people express sympathy with al-Qaida's viral social movement or other forms of violent political expression that abuse religion and support terrorism, relatively few willingly use violence. Following a 2001-2007 survey of 35 predominantly Muslim nations, a Gallup study estimated that 7% of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims thought that the 9/11 attacks were "completely justified". That's about 100 million people; however, of these many millions who express support for violence against the outgroup, there are only thousands willing to actually commit violence.
This is also true in the Muslim diaspora, which provides the overwhelming majority of al-Qaida followers. In the European Union, fewer than 3,000 suspects have been imprisoned for jihadi activities out of a Muslim population of perhaps 20 million. In the United States, fewer than 500 suspects have been arrested for having anything remotely to do with support for holy war against America after 9/11, with less than 100 cases being considered serious out of an immigrant Muslim population of more than two million.
If so many millions support jihad, why are only relatively few willing to kill and die for it? Although heroic action for a great cause is the ultimate end, the path to violent extremism is mostly a matter of individual motivations and small group dynamics in specific historical contexts. Those who go on to violence generally do so by way of family and friends within specific "scenes": neighbourhoods, schools (classes, dorms), workplaces, common leisure activities (soccer, barbershop, caf챕), and, increasingly, online chat rooms.
The process of self selection into violence within these scenes is stimulated by a massive, media-driven political awakening in which jihad is represented as the only the way to permanently resolve glaring problems of global injustice. When this perceived injustice resonates with frustrated personal aspirations, violence may be seen as a way out. Al-Qaida and its associates do not so much recruit as attract and enlist those disaffected people who have already decided to embark on the path to violent extremism with the help of a few fellow travellers.
Research shows that terrorists generally don't commit terrorism because they are extraordinarily vengeful or uncaring, poor or uneducated, schooled as children in radical religion or brainwashed, criminally-minded or suicidal, or sex-starved for virgins in heaven. Most have no personal history of violent emotions and generally peaceful in their daily lives but become "born again" into a radical cause.
Before and just after 9/11, jihadis, including suicide bombers, were on average materially better-off and better-educated relative to their populations of origin. Many had college educations or advanced technical training. A background in science, particularly engineering and medicine, was positively associated with the likelihood of joining jihad. Now, the main threat to the west isn't from any organisation, or from well-trained cadres of volunteers, but from an al-Qaida-inspired viral social movement that is particularly contagious among young adults who are in transition stages in their lives: immigrants, students, those still in search of friends, mates or jobs.
The popular notion of a "clash of civilizations" is woefully misleading. Violent extremism represents the collapse of traditional territorial cultures, not their resurgence, as people unmoored from millennial traditions flail about in search of a social identity. Individuals now mostly radicalise horizontally with their peers, rather than vertically through institutional leaders or organisational hierarchies: in small groups of friends �� from the same neighbourhood or social network �� or even as loners who find common cause with a virtual internet community. Appeals to moderate Islam are about as irrelevant as older people appealing to adolescents to moderate their music or clothes.
In the long run, perhaps the most important counterterrorism measure of all is to provide alternative heroes and hopes that are more enticing and empowering than any moral lessons or material offerings (jobs that help to relieve the terrible boredom and inactivity of immigrant youth in Europe and the underemployed throughout much of the Muslim world, will not alone offset the allure of playing at war). It is also important to provide alternate local networks and chatrooms that speak to the inherent idealism, sense of risk and adventure, and need for peer approval that young people everywhere tend toward. It could even be a 21st-century version of what the Boy Scouts and high school football teams did for immigrants and potentially troublesome youth as America urbanised a century ago. Ask any cop on the beat: those things work. It has to be done with the input and insight of local communities, and chiefly peer-to-peer, or it won't be effective: deradicalisation, like radicalisation itself, works mainly from the bottom up, not from the top down. This, of course, is not how you stop terrorism today, but how you do it for tomorrow.
The home secretary, John Reid, today said such an attack could have caused civilian casualties on an "unprecedented scale".
It is believed the intention was to set off near simultaneous blasts on flights, probably bound for the US, using explosives smuggled into passenger cabins inside hand luggage.
Police were holding 24 people in custody in London following overnight raids by anti-terror officers and MI5. Mr Reid would not comment on claims that the detainees were British-born Muslims of Pakistani descent.
A decision was made to move suddenly following months of surveillance. US counter-terrorism officials told the Associated Press that three major US airlines - United, American Airlines and Continental - had been targeted in the plot.
The aim of the plot was to blow up planes over UK and US cities, Sky News reported. Five US cities are thought to have been among the targets, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles, it added.
The plans could have been carried out in the next two days, a White House spokesman said today. He added that Tony Blair and George Bush had discussed the plot on Sunday and Wednesday.
Reports citing official sources said the apparent idea was to use a liquid-based explosive, and there were suggestions one explosive component was to have been hidden in bottles of fizzy drink.
President Bush said the was a "stark reminder" that the US was "at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom." He thanked the British government for "busting this plot".
There is major disruption to flights in the UK, and European airlines have cancelled hundreds of flights into London. Flights at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted airports have been particularly disrupted. It is believed that up to 400,000 passengers have been affected.
Emergency restrictions were in place at British airports, barring passengers from taking any liquids or other hand luggage, apart from travel documents and essential prescriptions, on board. Heathrow officials said all milk for babies would have to be tasted by an "accompanying passenger".
There were no firm indications of plans for an attack to have been carried out today, but the US homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, said it was a "well advanced" scheme. He said the plot was based in Britain but was "international in scope".
Mr Chertoff said: "They had accumulated the capability necessary and they were well on their way."
"This wasn't supposed to happen today," a US official who asked not to be named, told the Washington Post. "It was supposed to happen several days from now. We hear the British lost track of one or two guys. They had to move."
The US attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, said it was "suggestive of al-Qaida tactics". British officials were more circumspect about the background to the plot than their US counterparts, stressing that they had to be careful about what they said because there could be trials in future.
Officials also declined to confirm the number of flights believed to have been targets - sources said up to 10 - and the home secretary would only say the alleged intention was to carry out a "wave" of attacks.
Paul Stephenson, the deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police, spoke of the threat of "mass murder" on an "unimaginable scale".
Mr Reid said there was confidence that the plot's "main players have been accounted for", but added that officials were not being "complacent".
Most of the suspects detained overnight were arrested in east London. Two people were also arrested in Birmingham, and Mr Stephenson said there had also been an operation in the Thames Valley.
Thames Valley Police said homes in High Wycombe were also being searched. But a spokesman stressed there was not thought to be a direct threat to people in the area.
Peter Clarke, the head of the Metropolitan police's anti-terror branch, said the operation had involved an "unprecedented level of surveillance" and had reached a "critical point" last night when officers move to "protect the public".
The focus of the long investigation had been on the "meetings, movement, travel pending and the aspirations of a large group of people", and the alleged plot had "global dimensions", he said.
At 2am, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre raised the UK terror alert from severe to critical - its highest level - for the first time. The Home Office website defines critical as meaning an attack is expected imminently.
The US government responded by raising its threat assessment to red, the highest level, for commercial flights from Britain. Passengers in the US have also been prohibited from carrying liquids or lotions on flights.
Mr Chertoff said the plotters had "planned to carry the components of the bombs disguised as beverages, electronic devices or other common objects". Components could then be mixed on board to create explosives, he said.
If 10 planes had been targeted, it would have been by far the most ambitious terror plot since the September 11 2001 attacks in the US killed more than 2,700 people.
Downing Street said Tony Blair, who is on holiday in the Caribbean, was being kept constantly informed of developments and had briefed the US president, George Bush, overnight.
The anti-terror operations were carried out with Mr Blair's "full support", No 10 said.
The restrictions caused delays of up to five hours on some flights, and the disruption was expected to last for several days.
All passengers were hand searched, and their footwear and all items they were carrying x-ray screened. Laptop computers, mobile phones and iPods are among the items banned from being carried on board.
At Heathrow terminal one and Manchester airport, huge queues stretched the length of the departure lounge this morning.
Yesterday, Mr Reid said Britain was facing its most sustained period of serious threat since the end of the second world war and told critics of the government's controversial anti-terror tactics that they "just don't get it".
In recent months, officials have said several plots had been foiled since the July 7 London bombings, in which 52 people died.
Three days before Christmas 2001, Briton Richard Reid, who pledged allegiance to al-Qaida, tried to set off explosives in his shoes while on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami.
Since the attacks on the United States in September 2001, there have been more than a thousand references in British national newspapers, working out at almost one every single day, to the phrase "dirty bomb". There have been articles about how such a device can use ordinary explosives to spread lethal radiation; about how London would be evacuated in the event of such a detonation; about the Home Secretary David Blunkett's statement on terrorism in November 2002 that specifically raised the possibility of a dirty bomb being planted in Britain; and about the arrests of several groups of people, the latest only last month, for allegedly plotting exactly that.
Starting next Wednesday, BBC2 is to broadcast a three-part documentary series that will add further to what could be called the dirty bomb genre. But, as its title suggests, The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear takes a different view of the weapon's potential.
"I don't think it would kill anybody," says Dr Theodore Rockwell, an authority on radiation, in an interview for the series. "You'll have trouble finding a serious report that would claim otherwise." The American department of energy, Rockwell continues, has simulated a dirty bomb explosion, "and they calculated that the most exposed individual would get a fairly high dose [of radiation], not life-threatening." And even this minor threat is open to question. The test assumed that no one fled the explosion for one year.
During the three years in which the "war on terror" has been waged, high-profile challenges to its assumptions have been rare. The sheer number of incidents and warnings connected or attributed to the war has left little room, it seems, for heretical thoughts. In this context, the central theme of The Power of Nightmares is riskily counter-intuitive and provocative. Much of the currently perceived threat from international terrorism, the series argues, "is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media." The series' explanation for this is even bolder: "In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power."
Adam Curtis, who wrote and produced the series, acknowledges the difficulty of saying such things now. "If a bomb goes off, the fear I have is that everyone will say, 'You're completely wrong,' even if the incident doesn't touch my argument. This shows the way we have all become trapped, the way even I have become trapped by a fear that is completely irrational."
So controversial is the tone of his series, that trailers for it were not broadcast last weekend because of the killing of Kenneth Bigley. At the BBC, Curtis freely admits, there are "anxieties". But there is also enthusiasm for the programmes, in part thanks to his reputation. Over the past dozen years, via similarly ambitious documentary series such as Pandora's Box, The Mayfair Set and The Century of the Self, Curtis has established himself as perhaps the most acclaimed maker of serious television programmes in Britain. His trademarks are long research, the revelatory use of archive footage, telling interviews, and smooth, insistent voiceovers concerned with the unnoticed deeper currents of recent history, narrated by Curtis himself in tones that combine traditional BBC authority with something more modern and sceptical: "I want to try to make people look at things they think they know about in a new way."
The Power of Nightmares seeks to overturn much of what is widely believed about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. The latter, it argues, is not an organised international network. It does not have members or a leader. It does not have "sleeper cells". It does not have an overall strategy. In fact, it barely exists at all, except as an idea about cleansing a corrupt world through religious violence.
Curtis' evidence for these assertions is not easily dismissed. He tells the story of Islamism, or the desire to establish Islam as an unbreakable political framework, as half a century of mostly failed, short-lived revolutions and spectacular but politically ineffective terrorism. Curtis points out that al-Qaida did not even have a name until early 2001, when the American government decided to prosecute Bin Laden in his absence and had to use anti-Mafia laws that required the existence of a named criminal organisation.
Curtis also cites the Home Office's own statistics for arrests and convictions of suspected terrorists since September 11 2001. Of the 664 people detained up to the end of last month, only 17 have been found guilty. Of these, the majority were Irish Republicans, Sikh militants or members of other groups with no connection to Islamist terrorism. Nobody has been convicted who is a proven member of al-Qaida.
In fact, Curtis is not alone in wondering about all this. Quietly but increasingly, other observers of the war on terror have been having similar doubts. "The grand concept of the war has not succeeded," says Jonathan Eyal, director of the British military thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. "In purely military terms, it has been an inconclusive war ... a rather haphazard operation. Al-Qaida managed the most spectacular attack, but clearly it is also being sustained by the way that we rather cavalierly stick the name al-Qaida on Iraq, Indonesia, the Philippines. There is a long tradition that if you divert all your resources to a threat, then you exaggerate it."
Bill Durodie, director of the international centre for security analysis at King's College London, says: "The reality [of the al-Qaida threat to the west] has been essentially a one-off. There has been one incident in the developed world since 9/11 [the Madrid bombings]. There's no real evidence that all these groups are connected." Crispin Black, a senior government intelligence analyst until 2002, is more cautious but admits the terrorist threat presented by politicians and the media is "out of date and too one-dimensional. We think there is a bit of a gulf between the terrorists' ambition and their ability to pull it off."
Terrorism, by definition, depends on an element of bluff. Yet ever since terrorists in the modern sense of the term (the word terrorism was actually coined to describe the strategy of a government, the authoritarian French revolutionary regime of the 1790s) began to assassinate politicians and then members of the public during the 19th century, states have habitually overreacted. Adam Roberts, professor of international relations at Oxford, says that governments often believe struggles with terrorists "to be of absolute cosmic significance", and that therefore "anything goes" when it comes to winning. The historian Linda Colley adds: "States and their rulers expect to monopolise violence, and that is why they react so virulently to terrorism."
Britain may also be particularly sensitive to foreign infiltrators, fifth columnists and related menaces. In spite, or perhaps because of, the absence of an actual invasion for many centuries, British history is marked by frequent panics about the arrival of Spanish raiding parties, French revolutionary agitators, anarchists, bolsheviks and Irish terrorists. "These kind of panics rarely happen without some sort of cause," says Colley. "But politicians make the most of them."
They are not the only ones who find opportunities. "Almost no one questions this myth about al-Qaida because so many people have got an interest in keeping it alive," says Curtis. He cites the suspiciously circular relationship between the security services and much of the media since September 2001: the way in which official briefings about terrorism, often unverified or unverifiable by journalists, have become dramatic press stories which - in a jittery media-driven democracy - have prompted further briefings and further stories. Few of these ominous announcements are retracted if they turn out to be baseless: "There is no fact-checking about al-Qaida."
In one sense, of course, Curtis himself is part of the al-Qaida industry. The Power of Nightmares began as an investigation of something else, the rise of modern American conservatism. Curtis was interested in Leo Strauss, a political philosopher at the university of Chicago in the 50s who rejected the liberalism of postwar America as amoral and who thought that the country could be rescued by a revived belief in America's unique role to battle evil in the world. Strauss's certainty and his emphasis on the use of grand myths as a higher form of political propaganda created a group of influential disciples such as Paul Wolfowitz, now the US deputy defence secretary. They came to prominence by talking up the Russian threat during the cold war and have applied a similar strategy in the war on terror.
As Curtis traced the rise of the "Straussians", he came to a conclusion that would form the basis for The Power of Nightmares. Straussian conservatism had a previously unsuspected amount in common with Islamism: from origins in the 50s, to a formative belief that liberalism was the enemy, to an actual period of Islamist-Straussian collaboration against the Soviet Union during the war in Afghanistan in the 80s (both movements have proved adept at finding new foes to keep them going). Although the Islamists and the Straussians have fallen out since then, as the attacks on America in 2001 graphically demonstrated, they are in another way, Curtis concludes, collaborating still: in sustaining the "fantasy" of the war on terror.
Some may find all this difficult to swallow. But Curtis insists,"There is no way that I'm trying to be controversial just for the sake of it." Neither is he trying to be an anti-conservative polemicist like Michael Moore: "[Moore's] purpose is avowedly political. My hope is that you won't be able to tell what my politics are." For all the dizzying ideas and visual jolts and black jokes in his programmes, Curtis describes his intentions in sober, civic-minded terms. "If you go back into history and plod through it, the myth falls away. You see that these aren't terrifying new monsters. It's drawing the poison of the fear."
But whatever the reception of the series, this fear could be around for a while. It took the British government decades to dismantle the draconian laws it passed against French revolutionary infiltrators; the cold war was sustained for almost half a century without Russia invading the west, or even conclusive evidence that it ever intended to. "The archives have been opened," says the cold war historian David Caute, "but they don't bring evidence to bear on this." And the danger from Islamist terrorists, whatever its scale, is concrete. A sceptical observer of the war on terror in the British security services says: "All they need is a big bomb every 18 months to keep this going."
The war on terror already has a hold on western political culture. "After a 300-year debate between freedom of the individual and protection of society, the protection of society seems to be the only priority," says Eyal. Black agrees: "We are probably moving to a point in the UK where national security becomes the electoral question."
Some critics of this situation see our striking susceptibility during the 90s to other anxieties - the millennium bug, MMR, genetically modified food - as a sort of dress rehearsal for the war on terror. The press became accustomed to publishing scare stories and not retracting them; politicians became accustomed to responding to supposed threats rather than questioning them; the public became accustomed to the idea that some sort of apocalypse might be just around the corner. "Insecurity is the key driving concept of our times," says Durodie. "Politicians have packaged themselves as risk managers. There is also a demand from below for protection." The real reason for this insecurity, he argues, is the decay of the 20th century's political belief systems and social structures: people have been left "disconnected" and "fearful".
Yet the notion that "security politics" is the perfect instrument for every ambitious politician from Blunkett to Wolfowitz also has its weaknesses. The fears of the public, in Britain at least, are actually quite erratic: when the opinion pollsters Mori asked people what they felt was the most important political issue, the figure for "defence and foreign affairs" leapt from 2% to 60% after the attacks of September 2001, yet by January 2002 had fallen back almost to its earlier level. And then there are the twin risks that the terrors politicians warn of will either not materialise or will materialise all too brutally, and in both cases the politicians will be blamed. "This is a very rickety platform from which to build up a political career," says Eyal. He sees the war on terror as a hurried improvisation rather than some grand Straussian strategy: "In democracies, in order to galvanize the public for war, you have to make the enemy bigger, uglier and more menacing."
Afterwards, I look at a website for a well-connected American foreign policy lobbying group called the Committee on the Present Danger. The committee features in The Power of Nightmares as a vehicle for alarmist Straussian propaganda during the cold war. After the Soviet collapse, as the website puts it, "The mission of the committee was considered complete." But then the website goes on: "Today radical Islamists threaten the safety of the American people. Like the cold war, securing our freedom is a long-term struggle. The road to victory begins ... "
쨌 The Power of Nightmares starts on BBC2 at 9pm on Wednesday October 20.
Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Christino, who retired last June after 20 years in military intelligence, says that President George W Bush and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have 'wildly exaggerated' their intelligence value.
Christino's revelations, to be published this week in Guant찼namo: America's War on Human Rights, by British journalist David Rose, are supported by three further intelligence officials. Christino also disclosed that the 'screening' process in Afghanistan which determined whether detainees were sent to Guant찼namo was 'hopelessly flawed from the get-go'.
It was performed by new recruits who had almost no training, and were forced to rely on incompetent interpreters. They were 'far too poorly trained to identify real terrorists from the ordinary Taliban militia'.
According to Christino, most of the approximately 600 detainees at Guant찼namo - including four Britons - at worst had supported the Taliban in the civil war it had been fighting against the Northern Alliance before the 11 September attacks, but had had no contact with Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda.
For six months in the middle of 2003 until his retirement, Christino had regular access to material derived from Guant찼namo prisoner interrogations, serving as senior watch officer for the central Pentagon unit known as the Joint Intelligence Task Force-Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT). This made him responsible for every piece of information that went in or out of the unit, including what he describes as 'analysis of critical, time-sensitive intelligence'.
In his previous assignment in Germany, one of his roles had been to co-ordinate intelligence support to the US army in Afghanistan, at Guant찼namo, and to units responsible for transporting prisoners there.
Bush, Rumsfeld and Major General Geoffrey Miller, Guant찼namo's former commandant who is now in charge of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, have repeatedly claimed that Guant찼namo interrogations have provided 'enormously valuable intelligence,' thanks to a system of punishments, physical and mental abuse and rewards for for co-operation, introduced by Miller and approved by Rumsfeld.
In a speech in Miami, Rumsfeld claimed: 'Detaining enemy combatants... can help us prevent future acts of terrorism. It can save lives and I am convinced it can speed victory.'
However, Christino says, General Miller had never worked in intelligence before being assigned to Guant찼namo, and his system seems almost calculated to produce entirely bogus confessions.
Earlier this year, three British released detainees, Asif Iqbal, Shafiq Rasul Rhuhel Ahmed, revealed that they had all confessed to meeting bin Laden and Mohamed Atta, leader of the 11 September hijackers, at a camp in Afghanistan in 2000. All had cracked after three months isolated in solitary confinement and interrogation sessions in chains that lasted up to 12 hours daily.
Eventually, MI5 proved what they had said initially - that none had left the UK that year. Rasul had been working at a branch of Currys. The disclosures come on the eve of a House of Lords appeal on the fate of the foreign terrorist suspects held without trial in British prisons.
Tomorrow, the Lords will determine whether it was lawful for the government to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights to allow for the detention of the men at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. It is widely believed that some of the men are held on evidence obtained from prisoners at Guant찼namo. An officer from MI5 admitted under cross-examination by lawyers acting for the detainees that the British intelligence services would make use of information obtained under torture by foreign governments.
A high court appeal in August found that it was lawful for the British government to use information obtained under torture by foreign governments to avert an imminent attack, but there was no evidence that it had done so in the case of the detainees held in British jails.
Speaking at an Observer fringe meeting at the Labour party conference last week, Lord Chancellor Charlie Falconer backed the decision of the court but said it was 'an almost impossible ethical question'.
While emphasising that Britain repudiated the use of torture he said: 'We cannot condone torture, but the basis of those incarcerations is protection of other people. If we thought that 'X' was going to blow up the Tube and we thought that information was obtained by a foreign intelligence service, can we really say that we can't detain people because that information was obtained by torture?
'That's the dilemma the government is faced with. The courts have taken the view as a matter of law, that we are entitled to rely on it and I have the awful feeling that is probably the right conclusion.'
The war on terror, George Bush once declared, "will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated". But Barack Obama's administration, it appears, has ended it rather more discreetly - via email.
A message sent recently to senior Pentagon staff explains that "this administration prefers to avoid using the term Long War or Global War On Terror (Gwot) ... please pass this on to your speechwriters". Instead, they have been asked to use a bureaucratic phrase that could hardly be further from the fiery rhetoric of the months immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The global war on terror is dead; long live "overseas contingency operations".
Rumours of the imminent demise of the war on terror had been circulating for some time, and some key officials have been mentioning "overseas contingency operations" for weeks. The US defence department email, obtained by the Washington Post, seems to confirm the shift, although the Office of Management and Budget, which reviews the public testimony of administration personnel in advance, denied reports that it had ordered an across-the-board change in language.
Tony Blair was an avid supporter of Bush's terminology - "whatever the technical or legal issues about a declaration of war, the fact is we are at war with terrorism", he once said - but experts came to agree that the phrase was unhelpful.
A war on terror was too broad ever to be won, they argued, while defining not a group or ideology but a type of violence as the enemy was incoherent.
Even Donald Rumsfeld, one of the war's architects, tried in vain to persuade Bush to rebrand it the "global struggle against violent extremism", or GSave. Writing in the Guardian in January, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, said it had been a mistake that may have caused "more harm than good".
Since taking office, Obama has taken several concrete steps to shift direction, ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay and the CIA's secret prisons, and moving to end harsh interrogation practices.
"Declaring war on a method of violence was like declaring war on amphibious warfare," said Jeffrey Record, a strategy expert at the US military's Air War College in Alabama.
"Also, it suggested that there was a military solution, and that we were at war with all practitioners of terrorism, whether they threatened American interests or not. 'War' is very much overused here in the United States - on crime, drugs, poverty. Everything has to be a war. We would have been much smarter to approach terrorism as the Europeans do, as a criminal activity."
But he was not enthusiastic about the replacement term. "I'm not sure it means much of anything," he said. "And I'm not sure we're going to make any great progress by replacing one unfortunate term with another."
A major Islamist plot to kill police officers in the street has been foiled at the eleventh hour, prosecutors have said, after counter-terror raids led to the arrest of 15 suspected jihadis in Belgium and France.
In the same series of raids, two suspected terrorists were shot dead by police and another wounded in the Belgian town of Verviers, near the German border.
Authorities said they had moved to dismantle an active terror cell spanning both European countries to avert an imminent terrorist attack aimed at police officers and buildings in Belgium.
Eric van der Sypt, a Belgian federal magistrate, said 13 suspected terrorists were arrested in Belgium overnight with a further two detained in France. Nine of the suspects were held in raids in Molenbeek, two in Brussels, one in Berchem, one in Verviers, where the shootout took place, and two in France.
All three Verviers gunmen were Belgian nationals and are thought to have belonged to a homegrown cell of jihadis that recently returned from Syria. Van der Sypt added that officers were still working to formally identify the two gunmen killed in the shootout.
At the address in Verviers, police found ammunition and weapons including four Kalashnikovs, several smaller firearms and explosives. Search teams also discovered several police uniforms, walkie-talkies, radios, mobile phones and false documents and a �쐓ignificant amount of money��, Van der Sypt said.
In Molenbeek, police found ammunition, a knife, mobile phones and �쐂ifferent objects important for the investigation��.
�쏷his operation was meant to dismantle a terrorist cell and also the logistic network behind it,�� he said. �쏷his investigation for the time being has shown that these people had intentions to kill several policemen in the street and at police [stations].��
Van der Sypt said there was no link between events in Verviers and last week�셲 terror attacks in Paris but revealed that an atrocity on a similar scale had been averted at the last minute.
�쏷his operation stopped a major terrorist attack from taking place. You could say a second potential Paris has been averted,�� he said.
Meanwhile, several Jewish schools in Belgium have been closed amid warnings that they could be targets for Islamist militants, while cities across the country remain on a heightened state of alert.
Jewish schools in Brussels and Antwerp were closed and classes cancelled after officials said they were a �쐏otential target�� for radical Islamists, the Belgian news site Joods Actueel reported.
French and German authorities arrested at least 14 other people on Friday suspected of links to Islamic State (Isis), and the Gare de l�섷st train station in Paris was evacuated after a bomb scare, with Europe on high alert for further potential terrorist attacks.
A senior Belgian counter-terrorism official, who was not named, told CNN that the alleged terror cell was believed to have received instructions from Islamic State. The US news outlet quoted a separate western intelligence source as saying that the ongoing terror threat in Europe involved up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 to 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Police sources told Belgian television stations they had resolved to launch the pre-emptive operation against the terrorist suspects a fortnight ago after bugging the homes and cars of the men who were said to have recently returned from fighting in the war in Syria. The investigation concluded that a large-scale attack was imminent, targeting police stations.
Separately, on Friday morning police in Berlin arrested two men suspected of helping to recruit for Isis in Syria. The pair were taken into custody following dawn raids on 11 residences in the German capital. Police said the men were not suspected of planning attacks in Germany.
The Paris prosecutor�셲 office said 12 people were arrested in anti-terrorism raids in the region, targeting people linked to the gunman who attacked a kosher supermarket in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings and claimed ties to Isis.
The US secretary of state, John Kerry, was in Paris on Friday to meet French leaders and deliver a speech in the Paris city hall in a visit aimed at making up for the absence of senior US officials at Sunday�셲 mass rally in defiance of last week�셲 terrorist attacks.
The head of the European Union�셲 police agency, Europol, warned on Friday that the large number of radicalised Islamic extremists across Europe, their lack of command structure and growing sophistication make it �쐃xtremely difficult�� for law enforcement agencies to foil every terror attack. Rob Wainwright told the Associated Press that security and law enforcement agencies need to cooperate more closely.
He said the threat is evolving as cells controlled by a clear commander have been replaced by �쐔housands of independent actors or semi-independent terrorist suspects�� who are difficult to track.
�쏷hat�셲 the real problem I think that the intelligence community faces right now,�� he said.
The French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Friday that several French national media websites, including L�섷xpress, Le Parisien and France Inter, were experiencing problems with serving pages. The problem was traced to a common service provider, Oxalide, which said it was investigating an �쐇ncident�� with its core network, but did not yet know the cause.
Around Christmas, neighbours saw a van outside a small but comfortable home in the Winson Green neighbourhood of Birmingham. Khalid Masood, his partner and two children were moving out. Their new home was close by, but infinitely less salubrious. Their canalside terrace house had been swapped for a tiny bedsit above a restaurant on a busy road.
This and many other details will be picked over by analysts seeking to reconstitute the life of the man who killed four people with a 4x4 vehicle and knives before being shot dead outside the Houses of Parliament last week. The official aim will be to build up a comprehensive picture of the man responsible for the most lethal terrorist attack in Britain since 2005, in order to understand how he could have been stopped. Another aim will be simply to understand what turns someone into a terrorist killer.
�쏞learly the main line of our investigation is what led him to be radicalised,�� said Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard�셲 top counter-terrorism officer, on Friday.
Yet even such a seemingly banal objective is problematic. Many experts now question the whole concept of radicalisation. The FBI talks of �쐏athways to violence��, stressing that every individual�셲 journey to extremist murder is unique. There are fierce debates over the role of ideology, social circumstances, individual personality traits, and mental illness. Analysts prefer to talk of �쐒isk factors�� rather than �쐒oot causes��.
But some trends are evident. One is age. Masood, 52, was an outlier. Ten years ago, the average age of attackers in the west was around 29. Now it is nearer 25. In France almost 2,000 teenagers have been radicalised by Islamic State, officials say, with a 121% increase between 2015 and 2016.
One possible reason for this is demographic �� large numbers of adult second-generation immigrants. Another is intensive social media use on now ubiquitous smartphones, and consequent exposure to propaganda. A third is the specific appeal of Isis, which offers adventure, camaraderie, cash rewards and even sexual opportunity in a way that contrasts dramatically with the asceticism of previous militant groups like al-Qaida.
This also helps explain why the proportion of Islamic militants with criminal backgrounds has risen too. Former Isis militants in Europe have described the attraction of the group as like that of a gang �� yet one in which violence and misogyny become transformed into �쐒esistance�� and �쐒edemption�� for erring sinners. The group�셲 debased message, stripped of all but the most simplistic and distorted theological or political argument, appeals too to those who have neither the intellectual equipment nor inclination to debate, argue or learn.
Masood was convicted of a series of violent offences �� the most recent in 2003. He appears to have converted to Islam around then. A disproportionately high number of militants involved in plots in the west have been converts. In the UK between 2001 and 2013, 12% of �쐆omegrown jihadis�� were converts, but less than 4% of the overall Muslim population were. In the US, the total in 2015 was 40%, against an overall level of 23%. Do converts have something to prove? Are they, with superficial cultural and theological knowledge, more vulnerable to extremist interpretations of key teachings and texts?
Then there is identity. Masood, born Adrian Russell Elms, grew up one of two black men in a village in Kent, son of a single teenage white mother. Much of his life appears to have been marked by racial tensions. This too may help explain the appeal of not just conversion to Islam, but of extremism.
As early as 2008, French security services were stressing �쐓plit identities�� as a key factor behind extremism. Isis has made efforts to project its so-called caliphate as blind to colour, ethnicity and nationality �� in deliberate opposition to the discrimination it claims exists in the west. Isis followers have focused social media activity on incidents of racial violence or injustice in the west. �쏧 am not British or Indian but a Muslim,�� said one British teacher, son of south Asian-born parents, shortly before his death fighting with Islamic militants in Syria in 2015.
Masood does not appear to have tried to leave the UK to fight for the cause at any stage. But from 2004 to 2009 he seems to have been in Saudi Arabia, teaching English. A trip to the Islamic world is another common feature of the background of extremist attackers. Most spend a few months studying, rather than teaching, Islam and Arabic. Many, probably including Masood, are simply steeped in the more rigorous, intolerant and puritanical strains of the faith which, with their limited previous knowledge of Islam, they often do not question. Such strands facilitate, though do not guarantee, a later commitment to more aggressive ideologies. Some are clearly exposed to violent tendencies in establishments linked to extremists.
One factor that has emerged from recent research and reporting of extremist violence is the role of peers, associates and the family. Terrorism is a social activity, not one undertaken by crazed loners. Research last year found that 45% of Islamic militant cases talked about their inspiration and possible actions with family and friends.
Brothers are often involved �� in Paris in November 2015, and Boston in 2013. A married couple launched an attack together in California. Close friends team up �� such as the pair of converts who killed off-duty soldier Lee Rigby in London four years ago. A 2009 FBI study found an average of three, and as many as 14, �쐀ystanders�� in every attack. These were people who knew what was likely to happen but failed to stop it. Most were relatives or friends. Police investigating the Westminster attack will be aiming to find such �쐀ystanders��.
Finally there is the speed at which the �쐏athway to violence�� is travelled. British officials have spoken of �쐄ast turnaround�� radicalisation. Many experts are dubious. But fast or slow, few of those who end up as extremists wake up one day and decide they want to be Isis killers. The process is gradual, if sometimes rapid. Didar Mohammed, a would-be suicide bomber in Kurdistan, told me of �쐗aking up from a nightmare�� when he failed to trip his bomb. A 19-year-old Belgian Isis recruit who at the last moment escaped travelling to Syria, described how she �쐗as no longer herself��. Again and again, former militants describe how they barely imagined their eventual destination when their journey to violence began.
This is important. When on Monday or Tuesday Masood hired the vehicle he used for the attack, had he made up his mind days, or weeks or months before? Could the humiliation of having to give up a family home have been the final element that tipped him into action? What was he saying on WhatsApp, the messaging service, minutes before he launched his attack? And to whom?
It is human nature to try to construct stories, to simplify chaos into linear narratives which provide answers, solutions, explanations. This is what the search for the key to Masood�셲 radicalisation hopes to find. But we know that we do not experience our own lives in this way. Masood, for all his violent tendencies and criminality was, like most murderers, an ordinary man. We will have some answers to our questions. But anyone hoping to definitively resolve the puzzle of how a 52-year-old from Kent came to kill and be killed in the centre of our capital city will be disappointed.
The mother of a murdered British backpacker has accused Donald Trump of using �쐄ake news�� about her daughter�셲 death to further the �쐏ersecution of innocent people�� by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack.
Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, and Tom Jackson, 30, were killed in a knife attack at a hostel in Queensland, Australia, last August. Smail Ayad, 29, from France, has been charged with their murder.
On Monday the White House released a list of 78 attacks that it described as �쐃xecuted or inspired by�� Islamic State to support a claim by Trump that the media has been under-reporting terrorist atrocities.
The list, which was designed to bolster the case for Trump�셲 ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, included the killings of Ayliffe-Chung and Jackson.
In a defiant open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe pointed out that police discounted the possibility that the attack was terrorism related despite reports that the attacker shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� during the stabbing.
�쏮y daughter�셲 death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,�� she wrote.
She told the Guardian that since the White House published the list, Ray Rohweder, a police chief in Queensland responsible for investigating case, had emailed her to repeat that there was �쐍o terror link�� in her daughter�셲 death.
�쏧t�셲 the police who say it wasn�셳 a terror attack. That�셲 good enough for me and it should be good enough for Trump,�� she said.
She added: �쏦e [Trump] is trying to justify his actions in not allowing Muslims into the country from these seven countries. He�셲 trying to find examples of terror and this just isn�셳 one of them.
�쏧t does look like fake news. It�셲 another example of some conniving unpleasant politicking. He [Trump] is using it in a quite pernicious way to justify unfair practices and discrimination against people I find personally we have a lot to learn from.��
The email from Rohweder said: �쏷he crimes were not about race or religion, but individual criminal behaviour. I am so sorry that your terrible loss has become the subject of further comment.��
Ayliffe, from Cromford in Derbyshire, has repeatedly challenged what she says is the myth of a connection between her daughter�셲 death and Islamic fundamentalism. She suggested that Mia�셲 funeral should include a reading from the Qur�셙n to help discount the myth.
Ayliffe, who wrote The Rough Guide to Turkey travel book, said: �쏧�셶e lived and worked in Muslim countries. And I was perfectly happy for my daughter to travel in a Muslim country. She wasn�셳 killed in a Muslim country. She was killed in a Christian country, by a French national. It was not a racist, or a terror attack.��
She added: �쏷rump hasn�셳 just got Mia�셲 death wrong. He�셲 got everything wrong regarding Islam and immigration. What he really needs to do is visit some of these countries and learn about their cultures.��
In her letter to Trump, she wrote: �쏷he circumstances of Mia and Tom�셲 deaths prove that those with the strength of character to travel the world and learn about other cultures should be cherished as brave, resilient characters who have so much to offer if they are nurtured and give opportunities rather than defeated by adverse circumstances.��
She said of Trump�셲 travel ban: �쏷his vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred.��
Last month, outgoing pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson gave a speech at the Oxford Union and said that the War on Terror must, at some point, come to an end:
"Now that efforts by the US military against al-Qaida are in their 12th year, we must also ask ourselves: How will this conflict end? . . . . 'War' must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs. We must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the 'new normal.' Peace must be regarded as the norm toward which the human race continually strives. . . . "There will come a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaida and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, that al-Qaida will be effectively destroyed."
On Thursday night, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow interviewed Johnson, and before doing so, she opined as follows:
It is precisely the intrinsic endlessness of this so-called "war" that is its most corrupting and menacing attribute, for the reasons Maddow explained. But despite the happy talk from Johnson, it is not ending soon. By its very terms, it cannot. And all one has to do is look at the words and actions of the Obama administration to know this.
In October, the Washington Post's Greg Miller reported that the administration was instituting a "disposition matrix" to determine how terrorism suspects will be disposed of, all based on this fact: "among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade." As Miller puts it: "That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism."
The polices adopted by the Obama administration just over the last couple of years leave no doubt that they are accelerating, not winding down, the war apparatus that has been relentlessly strengthened over the last decade. In the name of the War on Terror, the current president has diluted decades-old Miranda warnings; codified a new scheme of indefinite detention on US soil; plotted to relocate Guantanamo to Illinois; increased secrecy, repression and release-restrictions at the camp; minted a new theory of presidential assassination powers even for US citizens; renewed the Bush/Cheney warrantless eavesdropping framework for another five years, as well as the Patriot Act, without a single reform; and just signed into law all new restrictions on the release of indefinitely held detainees.
Does that sound to you like a government anticipating the end of the War on Terror any time soon? Or does it sound like one working feverishly to make their terrorism-justified powers of detention, surveillance, killing and secrecy permanent? About all of this, the ACLU's Executive Director, Anthony Romero, provided the answer on Thursday: "President Obama has utterly failed the first test of his second term, even before inauguration day. His signature means indefinite detention without charge or trial, as well as the illegal military commissions, will be extended."
There's a good reason US officials are assuming the "War on Terror" will persist indefinitely: namely, their actions ensure that this occurs. The New York Times' Matthew Rosenberg this morning examines what the US government seems to regard as the strange phenomenon of Afghan soldiers attacking US troops with increasing frequency, and in doing so, discovers a shocking reality: people end up disliking those who occupy and bomb their country:
"Such insider attacks, by Afghan security forces on their Western allies, became 'the signature violence of 2012', in the words of one former American official. The surge in attacks has provided the clearest sign yet that Afghan resentment of foreigners is becoming unmanageable, and American officials have expressed worries about its disruptive effects on the training mission that is the core of the American withdrawal plan for 2014. . . . "But behind it all, many senior coalition and Afghan officials are now concluding that after nearly 12 years of war, the view of foreigners held by many Afghans has come to mirror that of the Taliban. Hope has turned into hatred, and some will find a reason to act on those feelings. "'A great percentage of the insider attacks have the enemy narrative �� the narrative that the infidels have to be driven out �� somewhere inside of them, but they aren't directed by the enemy,' said a senior coalition officer, who asked not to be identified because of Afghan and American sensitivities about the attacks."
In other words, more than a decade of occupying and brutalizing that country has turned large swaths of the population into the "Taliban", to the extent that the "Taliban" means: Afghans willing to use violence to force the US and its allies out of their country. As always, the US - through the very policies of aggression and militarism justified in the name of terrorism - is creating the very "terrorists" those polices are supposedly designed to combat. It's a pure and perfect system of self-perpetuation.
Exactly the same thing is happening in Yemen, where nothing is more effective at driving Yemenis into the arms of al-Qaida than the rapidly escalated drone attacks under Obama. This morning, the Times reported that US air strikes in Yemen are carried out in close cooperation with the air force of Saudi Arabia, which will only exacerbate that problem. Indeed, virtually every person accused of plotting to target the US with terrorist attacks in last several years has expressly cited increasing US violence, aggression and militarism in the Muslim world as the cause.
There's no question that this "war" will continue indefinitely. There is no question that US actions are the cause of that, the gasoline that fuels the fire. The only question - and it's becoming less of a question for me all the time - is whether this endless war is the intended result of US actions or just an unwanted miscalculation.
It's increasingly hard to make the case that it's the latter. The US has long known, and its own studies have emphatically concluded, that "terrorism" is motivated not by a "hatred of our freedoms" but by US policy and aggression in the Muslim world. This causal connection is not news to the US government. Despite this - or, more accurately, because of it - they continue with these policies.
One of the most difficult endeavors is to divine the motives of other people (divining our own motives is difficult enough). That becomes even more difficult when attempting to discern the motives not of a single actor but a collection of individuals with different motives and interests ("the US government").
But what one can say for certain is that there is zero reason for US officials to want an end to the war on terror, and numerous and significant reasons why they would want it to continue. It's always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war. Cicero, two thousand years ago, warned that "In times of war, the law falls silent" (Inter arma enim silent leges). John Jay, in Federalist No. 4, warned that as a result of that truth, "nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it . . . for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans."
If you were a US leader, or an official of the National Security State, or a beneficiary of the private military and surveillance industries, why would you possibly want the war on terror to end? That would be the worst thing that could happen. It's that war that generates limitless power, impenetrable secrecy, an unquestioning citizenry, and massive profit.
Just this week, a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration need not respond to the New York Times and the ACLU's mere request to disclose the government's legal rationale for why the President believes he can target US citizens for assassination without due process. Even while recognizing how perverse her own ruling was - "The Alice-in-Wonderland nature of this pronouncement is not lost on me" and it imposes "a veritable Catch-22" - the federal judge nonetheless explained that federal courts have constructed such a protective shield around the US government in the name of terrorism that it amounts to an unfettered license to violate even the most basic rights: "I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret" (emphasis added).
Why would anyone in the US government or its owners have any interest in putting an end to this sham bonanza of power and profit called "the war on terror"? Johnson is right that there must be an end to this war imminently, and Maddow is right that the failure to do so will render all the due-process-free and lawless killing and imprisoning and invading and bombing morally indefensible and historically unforgivable.
But the notion that the US government is even entertaining putting an end to any of this is a pipe dream, and the belief that they even want to is fantasy. They're preparing for more endless war; their actions are fueling that war; and they continue to reap untold benefits from its continuation. Only outside compulsion, from citizens, can make an end to all of this possible.
A 29-year-old woman has been charged over a failed jihadist attack near Paris�셲 Notre Dame cathedral as French politicians continue to argue about how to deal with the country�셲 severe terror threat.
The woman, named as Ornella G, was linked to a women�셲 terror �쐁ommando�� that the Paris prosecutor said was guided by Islamic State from Syria. Several women have been arrested in France in recent days as police believed a cell was about to attack Paris�셲 Gare de Lyon station, days after trying to blow up a car near Notre Dame.
The commando �� including a 23-year-old woman who had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out attacks this summer �� illustrated how extensive new terror cells have been able to form in France since the November attacks that killed 130 in Paris last year. A 15-year-old boy was also arrested and questioned at the weekend over links to the failed plot.
The boy had been under house arrest since France declared a state of emergency after the Paris attacks, two judicial sources said on condition of anonymity. They did not say why he was under house arrest. His arrest on Saturday came as he was planning an attack in a public place in the French capital, one of the sources said.
The prime minister, Manuel Valls, said on Sunday that the current terror threat in France was at �쐌aximum�� and that at least two terror attacks had been thwarted in the past week.
In a country that has seen more than 230 people die in terrorist attacks since January 2015, Valls said: �쏷here will be more attacks. There will be innocent victims. Each time I say those words, because it�셲 my role, I realise the importance and gravity of it.��
He said 700 French jihadis were currently fighting with Isis in Syria, including more than 200 women. French security services were also watching 15,000 people for radicalisation. He rejected repeated calls by the rightwing former president Nicolas Sarkozy for a type of internment in which people suspected of showing signs of radicalisation would be put in special detention centres.
Valls said Sarkozy was wrong to try to �쐓trangle the state of law��. Despite a serious overcrowding problem already facing French prisons, Valls said that 10,000 new prison places had to be created in the next 10 years for isolation cells and dedicated units for radicalised prisoners.
Ornella G�셲 fingerprints were found in a Peugeot 607 car that was abandoned last Sunday a few hundred metres from Notre Dame in an area thronging with tourists. The car contained five gas cylinders, three bottles of diesel and a lit cigarette. Two women are suspected of attempting to blow up the car before fleeing when they saw a man they believed to be a plainclothes police officer.
Ornella G, who has three children, had been previously known to authorities for wanting to go to Syria to join jihadis. Her lawyer told French media that she had confessed to investigators. The French paper Le Journal du Dimanche reported that she had told investigators that she and another woman had driven around Paris in the early hours of last Sunday morning, initially considering blowing up the car near the Eiffel Tower.
She has been charged with association with a terrorist group and attempted murder by an organised group. She was arrested at a service station in southern France as she attempted to flee south with her children and former partner.
Ines Madani, 19, who is also suspected of taking part in the failed Notre Dame attack, continued to be questioned on Sunday. She was arrested on Thursday in a town south-east of Paris with two other women as they prepared to carry out what officials called another �쐇mminent attack�� on a railway station, probably Paris�셲 Gare de Lyon. In her handbag, she had a written statement of allegiance to Isis.
Another of the women arrested, referred to as Sarah H, aged 23, had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out deadly attacks earlier this year. One of them was Larossi Abballa, who murdered a police commander and his police officer partner in June at their home in Magnanville outside Paris in the presence of their three-year-old son. He filmed the aftermath on Facebook Live before dying in a police raid. The other was Adel Kermiche, who slit the throat of an elderly French priest during morning mass in Normandy in July.
Donald Trump has criticised the mayor of London, hours after seven people were killed and 48 injured in a terror attack in the centre of the city.
�쏛t least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack,�� the president wrote on his personal Twitter account, �쏿nd Mayor of London says there is �쁭o reason to be alarmed!�쇺��
In response, a spokesman for Sadiq Khan said the mayor had �쐌ore important things to do than respond to Donald Trump�셲 ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks��.
Khan commented on the attacks in a statement overnight and in a television interview earlier on Sunday. In the interview, he said there was �쐍o reason to be alarmed�� by an increased and armed police presence in the city that day.
In his statement on Saturday night, issued as the London Bridge attack unfolded, Khan said: �쏮etropolitan police are responding to the horrific terrorist attack at London Bridge and Borough Market.�� He added: �쏮y thoughts are with everyone affected, and I�셝 like to thank the brave men and women of our emergency services who were first on the scene and will be working throughout the night.
�쏷his was a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night,�� he said. �쏧 condemn it in the strongest possible terms. There is no justification whatsoever for such barbaric acts.��
In the television interview on Sunday morning, Khan said the UK general election, scheduled for Thursday, should go ahead as planned. He added: �쏷here aren�셳 words to describe the grief and anger that our city will be facing today. I�셫 appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners.
�쏷here can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists and I am quite clear that we will never let them win.
�쏮y message to Londoners and visitors to our great city is to be calm and vigilant today. You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world. You saw last night as a consequence of our planning, our preparation, the rehearsals that take place, the swift response from the emergency services tackling the terrorists and also helping the injured.��
After Trump�셲 tweet, a spokesperson for Khan said: �쏷he mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city.
�쏦e has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump�셲 ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police �� including armed officers �� on the streets.��
In another tweet, Trump wrote: �쏡o you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That�셲 because they used knives and a truck!��
He added: �쏻e must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don�셳 get smart it will only get worse.��
Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who is a member of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN the president�셲 words �쐔roubled�� him. Former vice-president Al Gore told the same network: �쏧 don�셳 think a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticise a mayor who�셲 trying to organise his city�셲 response.��
In London, acting US ambassador Lewis Lukens issued a pointed statement: �쏧 commend the strong leadership of [Sadiq Khan] as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack.��
Hillary Clinton also put out a statement sharply contrasting Trump�셲 tone.
Trump was also widely criticised for his first reaction to the news from London, in which he retweeted an unsubstantiated headline from the conservative Drudge Report website and then said: �쏻e need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!��
The White House this week asked the supreme court to reinstate its bar on entry from six Muslim-majority countries. The measure has been blocked repeatedly by lower courts.
Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a western European capital city, has attracted ire from the Trump family before. In March, hours after an attack at Westminster Bridge in which five people died, Trump�셲 oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted: �쏽ou have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan.��
Trump Jr was criticised for taking those words out of context: speaking six months before the Westminster attack, Khan had also discussed the necessity of providing strong security for Londoners.
�� This article was amended on 4, 5 and 6 June 2017 to accurately reflect the timing of Sadiq Khan�셲 comments, and because an earlier version said Khan was the first Muslim mayor of a major European city. This has been corrected to say of a western European capital city.
The facts about what Thomas Mair did are beyond shocking, beyond dispute, and so hard for us to comprehend that we seek a suitable vocabulary. He was convicted by a criminal court and given a whole-life sentence. So does that make him merely a criminal of our worst imagination? Or does it go further than that? Can he reasonably be described as a terrorist?
Jo Cox�셲 bereaved and resolutely dignified partner, Brendan, gave us a clear view into his thinking. This, he said, was a political act �� an �쐇ncompetent and self-defeating�� act of terrorism. Not because the attack itself was not meticulously executed (it clearly was) but because it had wider and deeper aims: aims that Brendan Cox believed the attacker had failed to fulfil. Instead of engineering hate, Cox said, Mair had triggered an outpouring of love and solidarity.
The Oxford Dictionaries definition of a terrorist is: �쏛 person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.�� That clearly describes Mair and his modus operandi.
As he struck the fatal blows, he made clear that his was not solely an attack on Cox as an individual: �쏷his is for Britain,�� he said, and �쏫eep Britain independent,�� reloading his gun. His first court appearance, where he gave his name as �쏡eath to traitors, freedom for Britain��, confirmed that wider motivation.
Even a mind as warped as Mair�셲 cannot have believed that the slaying of one MP would achieve his desired aim. It was an attack on a public representative with the intention of terrorising all that she and others like her represented.
She was the blameless victim, but the target was a philosophy.
That Mair, as an avowed neo-Nazi, was apparently working alone without any obvious association with a group, does not detract from the fact that his aims were terrorist aims and the template employed was that of the terrorist.
After the verdict, Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said her officials had no doubt as to how Mair might best be classified. �쏮otivated by hate, his premeditated crimes were nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology,�� she said.
Hemming and her team had the option of prosecuting Mair under anti-terrorism legislation. They chose not to do so, not because he fell outside the definition but because the charges were framed in such a way as to make his motivation irrelevant.
For all that, the killing of Jo Cox was recognised at the time, by parliamentarians and the public at large �� at home and abroad �� for what it was: an attempt to leverage an isolated act of violence so as to achieve a magnified intimidatory and political effect. Terrorists have been doing that for years.
It has become a cliche question among race-rights campaigners (with whom I have common cause): �쏻hy aren�셳 far-right crimes considered terrorism?�� Such a common question that now, it seems, the police are changing tack and labelling Thomas Mair a terrorist (though not so much that they actually charged him with terrorism offences).
It�셲 certainly true that a narrow definition of terrorism as a �쐏olitical act�� would include Mair. But whatever one particular dictionary might say, there is no widely agreed definition of terrorism.
And while I don�셳 doubt that Mair�셲 motives were political, in the common understanding and usage of the term �쐔errorism��, more than this is required. Because, though he had far-right sympathies, it�셲 clear his actions weren�셳 supporting anyone�셲 agenda but his own.
To my knowledge there is no organisation that calls for the violent overthrow of the state, or for the killing of leftwing MPs. And though some eyewitnesses reported Mair shouting �쏝ritain first�� during his attack on Jo Cox, there�셲 no evidence he was acting for, or under the instruction of, the legal rightwing organisation of the same name.
In fact, the commonly held perception is that a criminal has to be acting on behalf of a wider organisation to be considered a terrorist. So, for example, even though there have been several �쐋one wolf�� attacks by jihadi extremists in the UK and beyond, they are carrying out the agenda of Islamic State, or al-Qaida, and part of a wider bloody struggle. These terror groups gain power because every attack carries the specific and sharpened threat of further violence from another sympathiser.
Mair�셲 guidance came from inside his head. His was a shocking hate crime against a dedicated young woman who was trying to make the world a better place, but it�셲 not surprising that this wasn�셳 widely considered a terror attack amid all the reporting at the time.
And if we�셱e to consider all �쐏olitical acts�� terrorism, then where do we stop? Was the Yorkshire Ripper, who wanted to rid the world of sex workers, a terrorist? What about Robert Ashman, the man who in 2000 killed Andrew Pennington, an aide to the Lib Dem MP Nigel Jones? Lee Harvey Oswald shot a president but has rarely, if ever, been called a terrorist.
By overusing the label we merely dilute our sense of the evil that lies behind those groups and networks that coolly and calculatingly conspire to bring about wide-scale slaughter.
And, to my fellow race equality campaigners: I�셫 not, of course, saying that far-right crimes cannot be considered terrorism. Groups such as Combat 18 have carried out acts of violence and harassment against Britain�셲 ethnic minorities since the 1970s. And the historic campaign of lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan makes it, in my view, a terrorist organisation. The KKK is, however, still legal in the United States, and its favoured candidate is about to move into the White House. It may take some time before this group is officially given the status it deserves.
Donald Trump appears to invent a terrorist attack in Sweden during a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday. Trump uses his speech to talk about migration in Europe and links it to terror attacks in Brussels, Nice and Paris. He then adds Sweden to the list, incorrectly stating that an attack had happened there on Friday
The terror threat level in the UK has been reduced from critical to severe and soldiers deployed to key sites around the country will begin to be withdrawn from Monday, Theresa May has said.
The prime minister said Operation Temperer, in which military personnel were deployed to bolster security in the wake of the Manchester bombing, would be scaled back after the bank holiday weekend.
Security officials had advised the government to raise the terror threat to critical, which means they believe an attack is imminent, after a suicide bomber killed 22 people, including children, at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday. Additional resources were deployed to help with the investigation into the attack and provide greater security at a host of weekend events. It is normal for a critical terror threat level to be maintained for just a few days.
May said: �쏷he public should be clear about what this means. A threat level of severe means an attack remains highly likely. The country should remain vigilant.�� Speaking after a meeting of the government�셲 Cobra emergency committee on Saturday, she said the decision had been taken after �쏿 significant amount of police activity�� over the last 24 hours.
The Manchester bombing was the worst terror attack to hit Britain since the 7 July attacks in London in 2005.
On Saturday a street in Manchester�셲 Moss Side was evacuated by counter-terrorism officers and controlled explosives were used in a raid on a property in Cheetham Hill.
Bomb disposal experts from the Royal Logistics Corps entered a property on Boscombe Street, on the Moss Side/Rushlome border, near the site of Manchester City�셲 Maine Road stadium used to be. Residents from neighbouring properties were evacuated, with others told not to leave their homes for several hours.
An address on Boscombe Street was being searched by detectives throughout Saturday as they sought to close the net on the suspected terror cell behind Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi.
Skiren Khan, 25, lives a few doors down and said she saw two men being put into a police van around 9am. Sunil Magnani, who runs a corner shop nearby, said two men were taken away by police from the terraced house. �쏰ne of my customers told me two guys were taken away, one Arab and one black guy,�� said the shopkeeper.
Two men aged 20 and 22 were arrested in the early hours of Saturday morning at the Cheetham Hill address, police said. Neighbours identified Yahya and Mohamed Werfalli, aged 20 and 22, as two of the occupants of the raided house. They were said to be of Libyan descent and part of the same friendship groups as the Manchester bomber.
Police have not confirmed the identities of any of those arrested in connection with the investigation. Eleven people remain in custody.
On Saturday afternoon, Britain�셲 top counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, said officers had carried out 17 searches, mostly in the north-west. He told reporters: �쏻e are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the bomb. There is still much more to do. There will be more arrests. There will be more searches, but the greater clarity and progress has led JTAC, the independent body which assesses threat, to the judgment that an attack is no longer imminent.��
The threat level was raised on Tuesday over fears that the network linked to Abedi was at large, possibly with access to further explosives and intent on attacking again.
The decision to drop the threat level down one grade to severe means intelligence analysts are satisfied that risk is now under sufficient control.
On Friday, Rowley said: �쏻e have already got a large part of the network, including some very significant arrests and some significant finds. Clearly, we haven�셳 covered all the territory we want to, but we have covered a large part of it, so our confidence has been increasing in recent days. But there�셲 still more to do to get the degree of confidence we want.��
By Saturday morning, analysts at the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which sets the threat level, were satisfied the danger posed by the network linked to the Manchester bomber had lessened through arrests and also after examination of materials seized after a string on raids starting on Tuesday.
There is still concern among counter-terrorism officials about the network linked to Abedi, the Guardian understands, but JTAC believes this is insufficient to state that an attack may be imminent.
Although the threat level has been scaled back, Rowley said there would still be a heightened security presence at events over the bank holiday weekend. In a statement on Saturday afternoon, he said: �쏤or practical reasons and precautionary reasons, we made the decision that the resources that we had planned for this weekends events will continue. They will still see that high level of policing presence �� some armed, some unarmed.��
But he added that after the bank holiday the range of additional resources deployed in the wake of the Manchester attack would be stepped down. He added that military support would also be phased out in the coming days.
The threat level of severe means an attack is highly likely. The two months since 22 March, when five people including the attacker died in an attack on Westminster, have seen a particularly high level of activity by terrorists.
A total of seven plots are publicly known about: the attacks on Westminster and Manchester, and five more that were disrupted and arrests made; four in London, one in Birmingham.
The deadly attacks in Brussels, which Isis has now claimed responsibility for, will have left many individuals in Belgium and elsewhere feeling frightened about a rise in terrorist incidents in Europe. Understanding whether those fears are justified, however, is incredibly difficult.
According to the Global Terrorism Database, three terrorist incidents were reported in Belgium between 2011 and 2014. Finding more recent (or, for that matter, older) data about the frequency of terror attacks is very hard to do, however, since these databases use a flawed methodology.
The Global Terrorism Database is as good a source as any, though. Located at the University of Maryland, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (AKA Start) was established in 2005 as a US Department of Homeland Security center of excellence. Start�셲 database covers the period between 1970 and 2014 and has information on more than 140,000 reported terrorist attacks.
In theory, that should make it easy to track how often terrorist incidents occur and where they are most likely to take place. However, the Global Terrorism Database draws on news sources (as well as existing datasets, books and legal documents) to track terrorist incidents. That makes things difficult: often media sources disagree about the location of an attack, the motives of the attackers and the number of casualties. Although researchers will try to weigh the evidence and select the information that seems most accurate, it�셲 still a judgment call.
It�셲 also problematic when media reports do agree �� that can sometimes mean there are duplicated terrorist incidents in the database. And the overall rise in the volume of media reports over time can exaggerate the rise in terrorist incidents. I discovered this myself when using GDELT, an alternative database, to track kidnappings in Nigeria; my analysis was flawed because it couldn�셳 differentiate between a rise in terrorism and a rise in reporting.
Therefore it�셲 unwise to draw conclusions about whether terrorist attacks are becoming more common �� but it is possible to take a glimpse at geographical patterns. That too should come with a substantial caveat, since the media are no doubt more inclined to cover incidents in certain countries. But there are nonetheless some differences so large that they reveal trends even after accounting for those caveats (and population size too).
Below are the 10 countries with the highest number of terrorist incidents reported by the media between 2011 and 2014. Countries in western Europe do not appear here. The United Kingdom is the only country in Europe to appear remotely close to the top in fact: with 338 reported incidents, it sits in 19th place. Of those, 288 occurred in Northern Ireland.
Over the same time period, 57 terrorist incidents were reported in the United States �� approximately 0.02 for every 100,000 residents.
Counter-terror police have arrested three men in Sheffield and Huddersfield following raids across Yorkshire.
Two men, aged 24 and 29, were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of terrorism offences. The raids were not linked to the investigation into the Manchester Arena bombing.
Residents living near the raided homes, including flats in the Kelham Island area of Sheffield and a house in the Crosland Moor area of Huddersfield, reported loud bangs and scores of armed police entering the properties.
A third man, aged 23, from Sheffield, was arrested on Friday morning on suspicion of assisting an offender.
A statement from the north east counter-terrorism unit said: �쏝oth property searches have now concluded and we would like to thank the local communities for their patience and understanding.��
Police said: �쏷here are no connections to the recent incident and investigation in Manchester. The operation is based on recently received intelligence. We understand that people may have concerns as a result of this activity and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of the public while these inquiries are carried out.��
The CTU moved to reassure the public, saying the loud noises were part of police operations to gain entry to addresses.
People living around a block of flats between Dun Street and Cornish Street, close to Sheffield�셲 Inner Ring Road, reported hearing a bang at about 5.30pm on Thursday. One man who lived in the block said he saw a second-floor flat�셲 door had been blown off.Others said they saw armed plain-clothed officers in the triangular courtyard in the centre of the modern block.The flats are fairly new, a short walk from the city centre, in an area that has changed in recent years from a site of derelict 19th-century industrial buildings to a series of residential flats redevelopments.On Thursday night, cordons on the streets surrounding the property were lifted, although a number of police officers continued to guard the block, which is opposite the Shalesmoor tram stop, as searches continued.Similar scenes were reported in Huddersfield, where a large number of armed police were deployed in the Ellison Street area of the town.
Pakistan's powerful intelligence services were heavily involved in preparations for the Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008, according to classified Indian government documents obtained by the Guardian.
A 109-page report into the interrogation of key suspect David Headley, a Pakistani-American militant arrested last year and detained in the US, makes detailed claims of ISI support for the bombings.
Under questioning, Headley described dozens of meetings between officers of the main Pakistani military intelligence service, the ISI, and senior militants from the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
He claims a key motivation for the ISI in aiding the attacks was to bolster militant organisations with strong links to the Pakistani state and security establishment who were being marginalised by more extreme radical groups.
Headley, who undertook surveillance of the targets in Mumbai for the operation, claims that at least two of his missions were partly paid for by the ISI and that he regularly reported to the spy agency. However, the documents suggest that supervision of the militants by the ISI was often chaotic and that the most senior officers of the agency may have been unaware at least of the scale and ambition of the operation before it was launched.
More than 160 people were killed by militants from LeT who arrived by sea to attack luxury hotels, a Jewish centre, a caf챕, a hospital and the main railway station in Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital. Casualties included citizens from 25 countries, including four Americans killed and seven Britons injured. The attacks dominated media for days and badly damaged already poor Indian-Pakistan relations.
European and American security services now fear that LeT, which has thousands of militants, runs dozens of training camps and has extensive logistic networks overseas, is moving from what has been a largely regional agenda �� focused on the disputed Himalayan former princely state of Kashmir �� to a global agenda involving strikes against the west or western interests. The documents suggest the fierce internal argument within the organisation over its strategic direction is being won by hardliners.
Headley, interviewed over 34 hours by Indian investigators in America in June, described how "a debate had begun among the terrorist outfits" and "a clash of ideology" leading to "splits".
"The aggression and commitment to jihad shown by several splinter groups in Afghanistan influenced many committed fighters to leave [LeT]," Headley said. "I understand this compelled the LeT to consider a spectacular terrorist strike in India."
Headley, who changed his name from Daood Gilani, told the investigators that the ISI hoped the Mumbai attack would slow or stop growing "integration" between groups active in Kashmir, with whom the agency had maintained a long relationship, and "Taliban-based outfits" in Pakistan and Afghanistan which were a threat to the Pakistani state.
"The ISI �� had no ambiguity in understanding the necessity to strike India," Headley is reported to have said. The aim of the agency was "controlling further split in the Kashmir-based outfits, providing them a sense of achievement and shifting �� the theatre of violence from the domestic soil of Pakistan to India."
Headley describes meeting once with a "Colonel Kamran" from the military intelligence service and having a series of meetings with a "Major Iqbal" and a "Major Sameer Ali". A fellow conspirator was handled by a Colonel Shah, he claims. Headley also alleges that he was given $25,000 by his ISI handler to finance one of eight surveillance missions in India.
However, Headley describes the ISI director general, Lt General Shuja Pasha, visiting a key senior militant from LeT in prison after the attacks in a bid "to understand" the operation, implying that, as many western security agencies suspect, the top ranks of the agency were unaware of at least the scale of the planned strike.
The Pakistani government has repeatedly denied any involvement of any security official in the Mumbai attacks. Last night, an ISI spokesman told the Guardian the accusations of the agency's involvement in the Mumbai attacks were "baseless".
LeT was banned in Pakistan in 2002. Jamat-ud Dawa, the social welfare wing of LeT, has been blacklisted in the wake of the Mumbai attacks although it continues to function.
The revelations could prove embarrassing to the US government as well as to the Pakistanis. Reports in American newspapers over the weekend claimed that Headley's wife had tried to alert American authorities to her husband's activities but had been ignored.
MPs preparing to vote on whether or not to bomb Isis in Syria would do well to read an article in Foreign Policy magazine, The threat is already inside, and nine other truths about terrorism nobody wants to hear.
Written by Rosa Brooks, a law professor at Georgetown university who has served as an adviser to the US state department, it places the Paris attacks - and all acts of terrorism by Isis - in perspective:
She concedes that �쐏oliticians don�셳 like to say any of this�� and goes on to list nine �쐏ainful truths��. In short form - you need to read Brooks�셲 piece in full - they are:
1: We can�셳 keep the bad guys out. All borders are permeable. There aren�셳 enough guards in the world to monitor every inch of coastline or border
2: Besides, the threat is already inside. The 2005 terrorist attacks in London were carried out by British citizens, the Boston Marathon attack was perpetrated by a US citizen... and the Paris attacks appear to have been carried out mainly by French citizens. Every country on earth has its angry young men.
3: More surveillance won�셳 get rid of terrorism, either. As Edward Snowden�셲 2013 leaks made clear, the United States is already surveilling the heck out of the entire planet and so are half the governments in Europe. The trouble is, the more data you collect �� the more satellite imagery and drone footage and emails and phone calls and texts you monitor �� the harder it gets to separate the signal from the noise.
4: Defeating Isis won�셳 make terrorism go away. Aside from Isis, there is Nigeria�셲 Boko Haram. Before Isis, there was al-Qaida and before that there was Hezbollah and Hamas... and before that there was Abu Nidal, Black September and various other PLO factions. And it�셲 not just Islam. Right-wing extremists in the United States still kill more people than jihadis. The 2011 attack in Norway �� which left 77 people dead �� was carried out by a single far-right terrorist. Since 2006, more than half of all deaths in terrorist attacks in the west have been caused by non-Islamist �쐋one-wolf�� attackers.
5: Terrorism (in the west) remains a relatively minor threat. Between 2000 and 2014, only 2.6% of terrorism victims in recent years lived in western countries.
6: But don�셳 relax too much, because things will probably get worse before they get better. From a historical perspective, the relative safety and security currently enjoyed by those in the western world is anomalous. The history of the west is every bit as violent as the modern Middle East. The world is likely to see an uptick in violent conflict in the coming decades, and the west is unlikely to be fully spared.
7: Meanwhile, poorly planned western actions can make things still worse. The fat, happy, over-privileged west wants to turn away the hundreds of thousands of desperate Muslim families seeking shelter and peace, just because a tiny fraction of those refugees might be militants. Islamic militants couldn�셳 ask for a better recruiting gift. The same goes for stepping up military action against Isis.
8: Terrorism is a problem to be managed. We can�셳 �쐗in�� a �쐗ar�� against terrorism or terror or terrorists any more than we can �쐗in�� a war on crime or drugs or poverty. But we can adopt sensible policies to reduce the risk and damage caused by terrorist attacks, such as funding moderate Muslim organisations. If we�셱e creative in our approaches, we can find ways to make terrorist attacks a little harder to carry out successfully, and make successful attacks less rewarding to those who carry them out.
9: To do this, however, we need to move beyond the political posturing that characterises most public debates about counter-terrorism, and instead speak honestly about the costs and benefits of different approaches.
Brooks concludes by arguing against overreacting to terrorism. �쏻e need to stop viewing terrorism as unique and aberrational. The more we panic and posture and overreact, the more terrorism we�셪l get.��
Saudi Arabian security forces have foiled a terror plot targeting the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, exchanging gunfire with one of the suspects who blew himself up inside a home on Friday, the interior ministry said.
The ministry described the plot as part of �쐓elf-serving schemes managed from abroad��.
Five people, including a woman, were arrested in security operations in Mecca, the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news website said, citing interior ministry security spokesman Mansour al-Turki.
Five security force members and six other people were injured, the report said.
Turki said police �쐄oiled the terrorist plan that targeted the security of the Grand Mosque, pilgrims and worshippers��.
In dawn raids on Mecca and the Red Sea city of Jeddah officers arrested suspects before surrounding the bomber�셲 location close to the Grand Mosque.
�쏹nfortunately he started shooting towards security personnel once he noticed their presence in the area, which led to an exchange of fire before he blew himself up,�� Turki said.
The blast partially collapsed the building where he had taken refuge, injuring six pilgrims, Turki said.
He added that four had already been released from hospital, and five security men were also slightly hurt.
The interior ministry said in a statement it �쐁onfirms that this terrorist network, whose terrorist plan was thwarted, violated, in what they would have perpetrated, all sanctities by targeting the security of the Grand Mosque, the holiest place on Earth.
�쏷hey obeyed their evil and corrupt self-serving schemes managed from abroad whose aim is to destabilise the security and stability of this blessed country,�� the statement said.
The ministry did not name the group involved in the attack. The ultraconservative Sunni kingdom battled an al-Qaida insurgency for years and more recently has faced attacks from a local branch of the Islamic State group.
Since late 2014 Saudi Arabia has faced periodic bombings and shootings claimed by Isis.
Near the end of Ramadan last year in the Saudi city of Medina four security officers died in an explosion close to Islam�셲 second holiest site, the Prophet�셲 Mosque.
It was one of three suicide blasts around the kingdom on the same day, in which a total of seven people were believed killed. The others occurred in Jeddah and in the Gulf city of Qatif.
The US Central Intelligence Agency said those attacks bore the hallmarks of Isis.
Most of the targets in Saudi Arabia have been the Shiite minority and security forces, killing dozens of people.
Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has called for attacks against the kingdom, a member of the US-led coalition battling the group in Syria and Iraq.
Since July last year police have arrested around 40 people, including Saudis and Pakistanis, for alleged extremist links.
Saudi Arabia�셲 counter-terrorism capabilities �� which for years were led by Prince Mohammed bin Nayef �� are well-regarded internationally.
On Wednesday Prince Mohammed was ousted from his posts of crown prince and interior minister, replaced as heir to the throne by King Salman�셲 son Mohammed bin Salman.
Friday�셲 counter-terrorist operation was the first to take place under the new interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, who is in his early 30s.
Prince Abdulaziz is the nephew of the deposed minister.
The Grand Mosque has been the target of militants before. In 1979, a group seized the mosque, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray toward five times a day, for two weeks as they demanded the royal family abdicate the throne.
The official toll of the assault and subsequent fighting to retake the mosque from hundreds of armed militants was over 100 people killed and 500 wounded.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries have cut diplomatic ties to neighboring Qatar and are trying to isolate the energy-rich country over its alleged support of militants and ties to Iran. Qatar long has denied those allegations.

The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull has led calls for an investigation into why a gunman who held a woman hostage while claiming links to Islamic State had been freed on parole just six months earlier.
Yacqub Khayre, a 29-year-old Somali-born Australian, killed a man before being shot dead by police in a Melbourne suburb on Monday night. He injured three police officers in a shootout in which the hostage was released unharmed. �쏷his is for IS, this is for al-Qaida,�� he reportedly told TV station Channel 7 during the siege.
While conservatives seized on Turnbull�셲 description of the siege as �쏧slamist terrorism�� to call for a new security crackdown and measures to tackle hate preachers, the prime minister demanded the Victorian state government explain whether parole was appropriate for a man with such a lengthy criminal history and who had been previously associated with a foiled terror plot.
The siege unfolded on Monday evening in the beachside suburb of Brighton, about 11km south-east of Melbourne�셲 central business district. At 4pm, police were called to a serviced apartment building in the area after receiving reports of an explosion, and cordoned off surrounding streets.
By 6pm, Khayre emerged from the ground floor apartment where he had been holding an escort hostage �� a 36 year-old Colombian woman unknown to him and who he had arranged to meet him at the complex that afternoon through an agency. He began firing at police who had the building surrounded. Three police officers were injured during the gunfire, and Khayre was killed. His hostage, who remained inside, was uninjured.
The body of the building clerk was found in the reception area of the apartment building, and police said Khayre shot the man dead when he first arrived at the apartment complex. This was likely the cause of the explosion noises reported to police.
The clerk was a 36-year-old Australian national born in China, and was recently married. He has a child. Police could reveal little more about the man as they were still speaking with his family, but Victoria�셲 police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said on Tuesday morning that he was an innocent man caught up in the situation while doing his job.
Police confirmed reports Khayre tampered with his ankle monitor bracelet and are investigating whether he did so in an attempt to lure police to the scene, though said they were already responding to reports of explosions by this stage.
Court documents relating to Khayre�셲 prior crimes detail a troubled childhood. He came to Australia as a child, arriving with his grandparents as refugees from Somalia via a Kenyan refugee camp.
In time, Khayre�셲 parents joined him in Australia, but their relationship was tense, the court heard.
In her sentencing of Khayre in 2012, then aged 24, for a series of charges including aggravated burglary and theft, Melbourne county court judge Felicity Hampel described his parents as �쐁onservative, traditional and strict��.
�쏽our grandfather died towards the end of your secondary schooling and you lost his steadying influence,�� Hampel said. �쏛t about that time, it would appear you had already started dabbling in drugs and alcohol, but following your grandfather�셲 death, you began abusing them seriously.
�쏽ou did not complete your schooling, and the cycle of drug abuse and committing offences commenced then, and has continued until now.��
Khayre served a period of time in the youth justice system as a teenager from 2007 for more than 40 offences including multiple burglaries and theft, giving a false name and address, possession of amphetamines, car theft and driving offences.
Hampel warned that Khayre was becoming isolated from society and sentenced him to five years and six months in prison, with a non-parole period of three years. This parole period was extended due to Khayre�셲 difficult behaviour in prison.
In November, he was released on parole, four-and-a-half years into his sentence.
Between his most recent sentence and his release from the youth justice system, Khayre spent 16 months in a high-security prison charged with terrorism offences related to a 2009 Holsworthy army barracks terror plot in Sydney. He was acquitted of the offences and, upon his release, Khayre�셲 family distanced themselves from him. His drug use continued.
In 2009, Khayre was ordered to take part in a deradicalisation program. By the time of his release from jail in 2016, he was no longer being closely watched by counter-terror police. Police are now investigating whether Khayre may have been radicalised again at some point, or whether the program was effective at all.
Turnbull asked on Tuesday morning: �쏦ow was this man on parole?
�쏦e had a long record of violence. A very long record of violence.
�쏦e had been charged with a terrorist offence some years ago and had been acquitted.
�쏦e was known to have connections, at least in the past, with violent extremism. �쏝ut he was a known, violent offender. How was he on parole?��
But Victoria�셲 premier, Daniel Andrews, said Khayre had adhered to his bail conditions in the six months before his death.
The state�셲 police commissioner Graham Ashton confirmed: �쏦e�셲 been compliant, including drug tests, attending appointments and observing a curfew.��
Victora, he added, had the toughest parole review system anywhere in Australia.
Victoria�셲 opposition leader, Matthew Guy, called on Andrews to resign during a heated parliamentary question time on Tuesday afternoon. He joined Turnbull in questioning parole laws and in asking why Khayre was released.
�쏽ou are weak, and you should resign,�� Guy told Andrews.
In December, the Andrews government introduced a raft of new laws to stop courts from allowing people convicted of serious crimes to serve part of their sentence in the community on parole. The new laws applied for those convicted of the most serious crimes including rape, murder, child sexual abuse and violent offences.
Khayre was granted parole in November and released in December.
��[Doing so] does not keep anyone in our state safe, it is as simple as that, and shame on you,�� Andrews said. He added that parole laws would be scrutinised.
Islamic State propaganda agency Amaq claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday morning in an online statement. �쏷he attack in Melbourne, Australia, was carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in response to the call for targeting the subjects of the coalition states,�� the statement read.
But Ashton cautioned against labelling Khayre�셲 actions as part of a plot, saying Isis �쏿lways tend to jump up and claim responsibility every time something happens��.
He said he believed Khayre was acting alone.
Police are now scouring Khayre�셲 home in Melbourne�셲 northern suburbs to find a motivation for the attack and insight into why he chose Brighton as the location.
�쏷here is nothing that we�셶e found thus far that would suggest to us that this was anything that was planned or done in concert with others,�� Ashton said. �쏷here isn�셳 a sort of ongoing threat in relation to any plot or anything around this individual.��
On Tuesday evening the deputy commissioner, Shane Patton, reiterated the comments.
�쏧 want to stress at this stage the community should feel reassured we aren�셳 looking for any other people,�� Patton said, but he added that security would be increased for sporting and public events occurring over the Queen�셲 birthday long weekend, which Victoria recognises on Monday 12 June. No threats to any venues had been made, he said.
Of the three police officers injured during the siege, one was treated at the scene, while two remain in hospital. Both were stable, with one requiring surgery for wounds to his face, and the other requiring surgery and skin grafts to his hand, Patton said.
He vehemently rejected a suggestion the counter-terrorism arm of Victoria police had made a �쐌istake�� for not watching Khayre more closely upon his jail release. He praised the counter-terrorism unit, saying police were working on the investigation with Australian federal police.
Patton added that police should be praised for foiling a number of terror plots in Melbourne. In 2015 police made arrests relating to an alleged terror attack being planned for Anzac Day remembrance events. In May that same year, they arrested a 17-year-old from Melbourne who was later found guilty of planning a terrorist attack on Mother�셲 Day.
In December, police arrested a number of men in raids across Melbourne allegedly planning a Christmas Day terror attack.
�쏷hey showed great courage last night in the way they quickly attended to an issue,�� he said.
�쏻hen they were confronted, they were decisive, they were swift when confronted by a terrorist armed with a firearm.��
What public purpose is served by the prime minister declaring she has raised Britain�셲 �쐔hreat level�� to �쐁ritical��? Before she thought another terrorist attack was �쐆ighly likely��. It is now �쐃xpected immediately��.
What are we supposed to do with this혻information, other than feel vaguely혻alarmed? The words can have meaning only in the wartime sense, of ordering us to put on gas masks and head for bunkers. Do we alter our journeys to work? Do we put on body armour? Do혻we keep away from crowded places? As for sending in the army �� terrorism�셲 propaganda coup �� what good does that혻do? It supposedly releases the police, but to do what?
For the past 48 hours we have witnessed the impressive calmness of the people of Manchester. They have not shown anger or clamoured for revenge, as in more hot-headed societies, just an intense grief over young lives pointlessly lost. Their prayers, candles, poetry and song have been those of a community closing round its bereaved with dignity. The accidental death of anyone for any reason is private agony enough, but when so many are involved,혻it is right for public figures to express a more distant sympathy.
Sympathy is quite different from aggressive language and bombastic response. We can agree with Theresa May that the Manchester attack was sickening, callous, warped, twisted, even cowardly, and the other adjectives with which she deluged it on Tuesday. We might wonder if she stopped for a moment to ponder the wisdom of turning personal tragedy into such purposeful aggression, knowing it would be greeted with glee by terrorism�셲 supporters. A similar rush to rhetoric on May�셲 part led to a severe over-reaction to the Westminster deaths in March.
Open societies have no defence against suicide bombers. Counter-terrorism manuals assert this, over and again. The conduct of public security �� such as swamping places with police, closing streets and searching bags �� merely redirects the determined bomber elsewhere. Terror bombing is the one foolproof weapon of the weak against the strong. We cannot screen every public space or search every pedestrian. There is nothing new to this.혻The car bomb and the terror grenade are as old as Conrad�셲 secret agent, and his �쐏estilence�� which stalks the street with혻death in its pocket.
All we can hope to do is enter into the혻minds of the bombers and their associates to prevent them at source. That is essentially a covert activity, and is clearly in its infancy. We can try to clean the pool in which fanaticism swims, the ideological grooming and conditioning. The security services must혻relentlessly infiltrate Islamist networks. That is their job �� they claim to foil a dozen attacks a year �� but publicising it cannot be necessary.
When accused of seeking political capital from terrorist outrages, politicians explain that their job is to �쐃xpress public outrage and show that something is being done��. That is cynical. Mancunians this week expressed grief, not outrage. A leader�셲 job is to allay rather than promote public anxiety. It is to minimise rather than propagate the impact of an incident.
The key text here remains the reaction of New York�셲 mayor Rudy Giuliani on the afternoon of 9/11, when he called on New Yorkers to stay calm, �쐀uy a pizza, take the kids to the park, see a show��. May makes no such statements. She does not even do what most prime ministers were careful to do during the IRA terrorism, which was to treat it as criminal, however heinous, and leave it the home secretary to respond.
May seized the megaphone for herself, and thus inevitably politicised the event. There was murmured talk of states of emergency and of suspended election campaigns. Armed troops were deployed in British cities. Parliament is shut down. Buckingham Palace�셲 guard is not changed. This is a statist response on a par with Tony Blair�셲 deployment of Scimitar tanks to Heathrow in 2003 as a �쐂eterrent to terrorism.�� The sole consequence was an instant, multimillion-pound hit to the tourist industry.
The prime minister yesterday plunged twice into Cobra, ignoring Thatcher�셲 maxim of �쏡eny terror the oxygen of publicity��. She was like David Cameron during last year�셲 Brussels massacre, when he put 10,000 troops �쐎n standby��, assigned 22 helicopters to the capital and donated 짙143m to further counter-terrorism measures. He thus encouraged Donald Trump to his absurd conclusion that Belgium and France, if not the whole of Europe, �쏿re혻literally disintegrating��.
The politics of fear is the oldest sick trick in the book. The idea that tanks, troops and helicopters can deter a suicide bomber in a crowded space is ridiculous. The only people it deters are foreign tourists. It shows the madness that seizes all ministers who descend the murky depths of Cobra. They think they are suddenly Churchill�셲 children.
If another attack occurs, as it always may, who can tell where or when? The perpetrator will have just one aim, to gain publicity for a cause. Bruce Hoffman, in his classic book Inside Terrorism, constantly emphasises the role of �쐏sychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target.�� Terrorism�셲 objective is not just to kill but �쐔o create power where there is none, through the publicity generated by the violence��. Publicity is terror�셲 �쐓econd wave��. Without publicity, terrorism is just dead bodies.
Today�셲 terrorist wants to frighten the enemies of Islam into curbing liberties and oppressing Muslims. That is why a genuinely �쐔ough�� response to Manchester would be opposite of May�셲. It would be to let the city bury its dead in peace, not surrounded by her guns. It혻would plead with Muslim leaders to look to their own. It would beg the media not to play terror�셲 game, by relentlessly publicising its violence and harassing the victims�� families.
Above all, a tough response would point out that terrorism is aimed at our freedom to congregate. It is the price of that freedom. For all its horror, the risk of death from terrorist violence is minimal. True toughness would downplay it, avoid the grandstanding and empty rhetoric, the machismo of soldiers and gunships. It would avoid the easy slither into a bruised and weakened liberty that is now the most menacing threat.
An investigation into the foreign funding and support of jihadi groups that was authorised by David Cameron may never be published, the Home Office has admitted.
The inquiry into revenue streams for extremist groups operating in the UK was commissioned by the former prime minister and is thought to focus on Saudi Arabia, which has repeatedly been highlighted by European leaders as a funding source for Islamist jihadis.
The investigation was launched as part of a deal with the Liberal Democrats in exchange for the party supporting the extension of British airstrikes against Islamic State into Syria in December 2015.
Tom Brake, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, has written to the prime minister asking her to confirm that the investigation will not be shelved.
The Observer reported in January last year that the Home Office�셲 extremism analysis unit had been directed by Downing Street to investigate overseas funding of extremist groups in the UK, with findings to be shown to Theresa May, then home secretary, and Cameron.
However, 18 months later, the Home Office confirmed the report had not yet been completed and said it would not necessarily be published, calling the contents �쐖ery sensitive��.
A decision would be taken �쏿fter the election by the next government�� about the future of the investigation, a Home Office spokesman said.
In his letter to May, Brake wrote: �쏛s home secretary at the time, your department was one of those leading on the report. Eighteen months later, and following two horrific terrorist attacks by British-born citizens, that report still remains incomplete and unpublished.
�쏧t is no secret that Saudi Arabia in particular provides funding to hundreds of mosques in the UK, espousing a very hardline Wahhabist interpretation of Islam. It is often in these institutions that British extremism takes root.��
The contents of the report may prove politically as well as legally sensitive. Saudi Arabia, which has been a funding source for fundamentalist Islamist preachers and mosques, was visited by May earlier this year.
Last December, a leaked report from Germany�셲 federal intelligence service accused several Gulf groups of funding religious schools and radical Salafist preachers in mosques, calling it �쏿 long-term strategy of influence��.
The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said he felt the government had not held up its side of the bargain made ahead of the vote on airstrikes. The report must be published when it was completed, he insisted, despite the Home Office caution that information in the document would be sensitive.
�쏷hat short-sighted approach needs to change. It is critical that these extreme, hardline views are confronted head on, and that those who fund them are called out publicly,�� he said.
�쏧f the Conservatives are serious about stopping terrorism on our shores, they must stop stalling and reopen investigation into foreign funding of violent extremism in the UK.��
Drama invites judgment. One of the oldest plays in the western canon, The Oresteia, ends with Athenian jurors deciding whether Orestes should be condemned for matricide. Ferdinand von Schirach�셲 Terror, a courtroom drama getting its British premiere at the Lyric Hammersmith, ends with a decision as to whether a German airforce major is guilty of murder in shooting down a hijacked plane targeting a packed football stadium. The difference is this: in The Oresteia we are simply observers but in Terror we become the jurors pressing a button to record our verdict.
This opens up a big question: whether we go to the theatre to be passive spectators or part of an interactive experience. A friend reacted with dismay when I told her the premise of Terror. Her point was that she goes to the theatre seeking emotional and intellectual engagement rather than active participation; and I have some sympathy with her point of view. I�셶e no wish to see the Terror principle widely applied, so that we have to decide whether or not Falstaff should be rejected at the end of Henry IV Part Two, whether Nora is right to walk out on her husband at the climax of Ibsen�셲 A Doll�셲 House or whether Salieri really was guilty of Mozart�셲 death in Amadeus. Some issues are best left unresolved.
Yet there is no doubt there is a growing hunger for some kind of active involvement. It can take many forms. Thomas Ostermeier�셲 astonishing production of Ibsen�셲 An Enemy of the People, which came to the Barbican in 2014, gave audiences the freedom to debate the contest between private profit and communal safety: it unleashed a torrent of anger the night I was there that would be multiplied tenfold if the production were seen today.
James Graham�셲 Privacy at the Donmar Warehouse invited audiences to keep their smartphones on to illustrate the way our personal data is open to commercial abuse. You can even get audiences to determine the action. Alan Ayckbourn�셲 Mr A�셲 Amazing Maze Plays, first seen in 1988, intriguingly asked us to vote on which rooms the child-heroine and her dog should explore when they entered the villain�셲 house.
As with so many things in theatre, active participation is neither good or bad in itself. It all depends on the context. It would be crazy to go to a pantomime and expect to sit like a Trappist monk. Yet when I go to a Chekhov play I seek total, and silent, immersion.
Even plays on public issues have different rules. When London�셲 Tricycle theatre in 2007 staged a play about Tony Blair�셲 possible indictment as a war criminal, Called to Account, they rightly rejected the idea of putting the issue to an audience vote. Yet, in the case of Terror, the vote is entirely legitimate, since it asks us to come to a decision about a highly topical issue.
�쏧 like a moral problem so much better than a real problem,�� the US satirist Elaine May once jokingly observed. But, in the case of Terror, the moral question has a practical application. The court has to decide whether the fictive defendant, Lars Koch, is guilty of murder. He has used an air-to-air guided missile to shoot down a plane containing 164 passengers. His defence is that he chose the lesser evil in that the hijacked plane was heading towards a football stadium containing 70,000 people. The catch is that he defied orders from the German minister of defence. The federal constitutional court at that time �� and this is 2013�� also decreed that it was wrong to kill innocent people in order to save lives. Technically, Koch may be guilty. But was he morally right?
It�셲 fair to say that the play gets the audience talking: I heard, and even took part in, heated interval discussions before the actual vote. Sean Holmes�셲 production also has the right forensic rigour and is acted with great precision by Emma Fielding (prosecuting counsel), Forbes Masson (defence counsel), Tanya Moodie (presiding judge), Ashley Zhangazha (Koch) and Shanaya Rafaat and John Lightbody (witnesses). My only doubt concerns Schirach�셲 premise: he never explains how the plane could devastate an entire stadium or explores the possibility of the pilot staging a crash-landing.
But the play restores drama to its classical function by asking the audience to make a moral decision. I would only argue that, in getting the audience to vote, it doesn�셳 go nearly far enough. The real issue is not how people vote but why they vote as they do.
I�셝 like a post-play coda, on Ostermeier lines, in which audience members are encouraged to stand up and explain why they thought Koch innocent or guilty and discuss how we respond to terrorism. Democracy doesn�셳 end with the ballot box and what would really enfranchise the audience at Terror would be giving them the chance to engage in vigorous public debate.
The long-lost ship of British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, HMS Terror, has been found in pristine condition at the bottom of an Arctic bay, researchers have said, in a discovery that challenges the accepted history behind one of polar exploration�셲 deepest mysteries.
HMS Terror and Franklin�셲 flagship, HMS Erebus, were abandoned in heavy sea ice far to the north of the eventual wreck site in 1848, during the Royal Navy explorer�셲 doomed attempt to complete the Northwest Passage.
All 129 men on the Franklin expedition died, in the worst disaster to hit Britain�셲 Royal Navy in its long history of polar exploration. Search parties continued to look for the ships for 11 years after they disappeared, but found no trace, and the fate of the missing men remained an enigma that tantalised generations of historians, archaeologists and adventurers.
Now that mystery seems to have been solved by a combination of intrepid exploration �� and an improbable tip from an Inuk crewmember.
On Sunday, a team from the charitable Arctic Research Foundation manoeuvred a small, remotely operated vehicle through an open hatch and into the ship to capture stunning images that give insight into life aboard the vessel close to 170 years ago.
�쏻e have successfully entered the mess hall, worked our way into a few cabins and found the food storage room with plates and one can on the shelves,�� Adrian Schimnowski, the foundation�셲 operations director, told the Guardian by email from the research vessel Martin Bergmann.
�쏻e spotted two wine bottles, tables and empty shelving. Found a desk with open drawers with something in the back corner of the drawer.��
The well-preserved wreck matches the Terror in several key aspects, but it lies 60 miles (96km) south of where experts have long believed the ship was crushed by ice, and the discovery may force historians to rewrite a chapter in the history of exploration.
The 10-member Bergmann crew found the massive shipwreck, with her three masts broken but still standing, almost all hatches closed and everything stowed, in the middle of King William Island�셲 uncharted Terror Bay on 3 September.
After finding nothing in an early morning search, the research vessel was leaving the bay when a grainy digital silhouette emerged from the depths on the sounder display on the bridge of the Bergmann.
�쏣veryone was up in the wheelhouse by that point in awe, really,�� said Daniel McIsaac, 23, who was at the helm when the research vessel steamed straight over the sunken wreck.
Since, then, the discovery team has spent more than a week quietly gathering images of the vessel and comparing them with the Terror�셲 19th century builders�� plans, which match key elements of the sunken vessel.
At first, the Terror seemed to be listing at about 45 degrees to starboard on the seabed. But on the third dive with a remotely operated vehicle, �쐗e noticed the wreck is sitting level on the sea bed floor not at a list - which means the boat sank gently to the bottom,�� Schimnowski said Monday.
About 24 metres (80ft) down, the wreck is in perfect condition, with metal sheeting that reinforced the hull against sea ice clearly visible amid swaying kelp.
A long, heavy rope line running through a hole in the ship�셲 deck suggests an anchor line may have been deployed before the Terror went down.
If true, that sets up the tantalising possibility that British sailors re-manned the vessel after she was abandoned at the top of Victoria Strait in a desperate attempt to escape south.
One crucial detail in the identification of the ship is a wide exhaust pipe rising above the outer deck.
It is in the precise location where a smokestack rose from the locomotive engine which was installed in the Terror�셲 belly to power the ship�셲 propeller through closing sea ice, said Schimnowski in a phone interview.
The ship�셲 bell lies on its side on the deck, close to where the sailor on watch would have have swung the clapper to mark time.
And the majestic bowsprit, six metres (20ft) long, still points straight out from the bow as it did when the crew tried to navigate through treacherous ice that eventually trapped Erebus and Terror on 12 September 1846.
The wreck is in such good condition that glass panes are still in three of four tall windows in the stern cabin where the ship�셲 commander, Captain Francis Crozier, slept and worked, Schimnowski added.
�쏷his vessel looks like it was buttoned down tight for winter and it sank,�� he said. �쏣verything was shut. Even the windows are still intact. If you could lift this boat out of the water, and pump the water out, it would probably float.��
The Arctic Research Foundation was set up by Jim Balsillie, a Canadian tech tycoon and philanthropist, who co-founded Research in Motion, creator of the Blackberry.
Balsillie, who also played a key role in planning the expedition, proposed a theory to explain why it seems both Terror and Erebus sank far south of where they were first abandoned.
�쏷his discovery changes history,�� he told the Guardian. �쏥iven the location of the find [in Terror Bay] and the state of the wreck, it�셲 almost certain that HMS Terror was operationally closed down by the remaining crew who then re-boarded HMS Erebus and sailed south where they met their ultimate tragic fate.��
The 21st-century search for Franklin�셲 expedition was launched by Canadian former prime minister Stephen Harper as part of a broader plan to assert Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic and promote development of its resources �� including vast reserves of oil and natural gas, which will be easier to exploit as the Arctic warms and sea ice disappears.
Parks Canada underwater archeologists have led the mission since it began in 2008. Now they must confirm the wreck is Terror, either by examining the foundation�셲 images or visiting the site themselves. With the first winter snow already falling in the High Arctic, Terror Bay will soon be encased in thick sea ice.
The latest discovery was made two years and a day after Canadian marine archeologists found the wreck of Erebus in the same area of eastern Queen Maud gulf where Inuit oral history had long said a large wooden ship sank.
The same stories described startled Inuit stumbling upon a large dead man in a dark room on the vessel, with a big smile. Experts have suggested that may have been a rictus smile, or evidence that the man had suffered from scurvy.
Parks Canada archeologists found Erebus standing in just 11 meters of ocean. Sea ice had taken a large bite out her stern, and more than a century of storm-driven waves had scattered a trove of artifacts around the site.
So far, archaeologists have brought up the bell from Franklin�셲 flagship, a cannon, ceramic plate and other objects.
Inuit knowledge was also central to finding the Terror Bay wreck, but in a more mysterious way. Crewman Sammy Kogvik, 49, of Gjoa Haven, had been on the Bergmann for only a day when, chatting with Schimnowski on the bridge, he told a bizarre story.
About six years ago, Kogvik said, he and a hunting buddy were headed on snowmobiles to fish in a lake when they spotted a large piece of wood, which looked like a mast, sticking out of the sea ice covering Terror Bay.
In a phone interview, Kogvik said he stopped that day to get a few snapshots of himself hugging the wooden object, only to discover when he got home that the camera had fallen out his pocket.
Kogvik resolved to keep the encounter secret, fearing the missing camera was an omen of bad spirits, which generations of Inuit have believed began to wander King William Island after Franklin and his men perished.
When Schimnowski heard Kogvik�셲 story, he didn�셳 dismiss it, as Inuit testimony has been so often during the long search for Franklin�셲 ships.
Instead, the Bergmann�셲 crew agreed to make a detour for Terror Bay on their way to join the main search group aboard the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Royal Canadian Navy�셲 HMCS Shawinigan, at the north end of Victoria Strait.
That is where the only known record of the Franklin expedition provided coordinates for what experts now call the point of abandonment.
A scrawled note dated 25 April 1848, and concealed in a stone cairn at Victory Point on northern King William Island, said Erebus and Terror had been abandoned three days earlier, stuck in sea ice.
Crozier was in command of �쐔he officers and crews, consisting of 105 souls��, because Franklin had died on 11 June 1847, the note continued, �쏿nd the total loss by deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers and 15 men��.
Crozier and Captain James Fitzjames signed the note, which had what seemed a hurried postscript, scrawled upside down in the top right corner: �쏿nd start on to-morrow 26th for Back�셲 Fish River��.
Survivors apparently hoped to follow the river �� now known as Back river �� south to safety at a Hudson�셲 Bay Company fur trading outpost.
None made it, and for generations, the accepted historical narrative has described a brutal death march as the Royal Navy mariners tried to walk out of the Arctic, dying along the way.
Now Franklin experts will have to debate whether at least some of the dying sailors instead mustered incredible strength, fighting off hunger, disease and frostbite, in a desperate attempt to sail home.
Britain has become more vulnerable to terrorist attacks because �쐄rustrated travellers�� are finding it more difficult to get to Syria and are being urged by different extremist groups to commit atrocities in the UK.
The return of some British fighters from Syria has added to a complex picture, which means the UK�셲 counter-terrorism agencies are feeling heat from all sides, intelligence sources said.
�쏷here is pressure on the counter-extremism strategy because of the confluence of frustrated travellers who would go to Syria if they could but are stuck here, and returnees,�� said one Whitehall source.
�쏝oth Isis (Islamic State) and al-Qaida are calling for these travellers to stay at home and attack in the west instead. The risk seems far greater now. The risk is changing.��
The police and intelligence services are seeking to establish the motive of the Manchester killer, Salman Abedi, and whether he was working alone or part of a wider network. Although Isis claimed responsibility, the police have not found any evidence to support this.
The MI5 director, Andrew Parker, cautioned last year that the agencies could stop most but not all attacks, while his MI6 counterpart, Alex Younger, warned of highly organised external attack-planning structures within Isis.
Sources pointed to a message posted earlier this month by Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden. He urged lone actors to seek martyrdom in the west, echoing the calls more frequently made by Isis as the group comes under intense military pressure in Iraq and Syria.
Hamza called on followers to �쏿venge�� the �쐁hildren of Syria��, the �쐗idows of Palestine��, the �쐄ree, honourable women of Iraq�� and �쐔he orphans of Afghanistan��.
Messages like this are being supplemented with instructions to commit jihad made on subscription channels set up on messenger services such as Telegram. �쏷hey are echo chambers and war rooms where they plan how to spread material on social media,�� said the source.
Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorism expert at the Royal United Service Institute thinktank based in London, said: �쏛l-Qaida has always been a threat, and Isis persists in calling for attacks.
�쏧 think this is reflected in recent patterns of arrest in the UK. There appear to have been more for plotting terrorist attacks than before, rather than the usual funding and propaganda. The tempo may be changing.��
The UK has faced 13 serious terrorist plots since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in May 2013, the Met police�셲 assistant commissioner and national lead on counter-terror policing, Mark Rowley, said in an BBC interview in March. But the list has grown by several more since then.
In addition to these plots and alleged plots, the police make arrests almost every week for lesser offences, from alleged support for terrorists to downloading terrorist-related material from jihadi websites.
More than 850 UK citizens have travelled to fight for Isis and other jihadi groups in Syria and Iraq, of whom about half have returned. The MI5 watchlist of people of concern has risen to about 3,000 and includes some who have returned from Syria. Those returning are assessed and placed in various categories, ranging from high to low risk.
Although the budget of all three intelligence agencies has been increased, MI5 only has the resources to maintain physical surveillance on a limited number of people. The people needed to maintain surveillance varies from case to case but a large number would be needed to keep tabs on even one person for 24 hours.
After the London bombings, MI5, which had been concentrated in London and Belfast, decentralised, establishing regional centres in the north-west of England and elsewhere around the UK.
The joint terrorism analysis centre, which is housed in MI5 headquarters and brings together the UK agencies and police dealing with counter-terrorism, upgraded the threat level from severe, the fourth highest ranking, established in 2014 amid fears of jihadis returning from Syria.
Moving it on to the fifth and highest level, critical, is only supposed to reflect security service fears that another attack is imminent. But it may be a precautionary, temporary measure until it is established whether Abedi was acting alone or with others.
The role of MI5 will come under scrutiny over whether the bomber was under surveillance. Abedi had been on MI5�셲 radar but was not considered high-risk. His name had come up in relation to other investigations but he was viewed as a peripheral figure, much the same as the terrorist responsible for the Westminster attack, Khalid Masood.
The intelligence agencies repeatedly warn that they do not have the resources to mount 24-hour physical surveillance of more than a small number of the 500 suspects regarded as being of concern.
The failure to prevent the Manchester attack will be felt keenly by all the intelligence agencies. Parker reflected this in an unusually personal statement for one of the heads of the UK�셲 three intelligence agencies.
�쏣veryone at MI5 is revolted by the disgusting terrorist attack in Manchester last night,�� he said, adding: �쏻e remain relentlessly focused, in numerous current operations, on doing all we can to combat the scourge of terrorism and keep the country safe.��
Theresa May�셲 �쐃nough is enough�� speech is an attempt to reshape dramatically Britain�셲 policy to thwart terror after murderous attacks. Mrs May gave her most explicit pitch today to policing thoughts rather than acts. This is a bad idea. It rests on a strategy to counter ideology rather than one that counters terrorism. It penalises people for holding unspoken beliefs and promotes a form of thoughtcrime. Such a move would end up with Britain losing the fight against terrorism in a legal minefield of dogma and piety. Mrs May wants us to believe that we face a threat from doctrines that do not espouse violence but somehow mutate into terror by contingency. The conclusion of her speech is that a non-violent person who harbours anti-British, extremist thoughts �� to be defined presumably by a future parliament �� could be blacklisted, maybe even criminalised. This is a leap away from current policy, although Mrs May has been heading in this direction for years. It should worry us all. What of animal rights, ecological defence or anti-arms-trade activists who do not subscribe to violent belief systems when criminal acts �� sometimes amounting to terror �� have been carried out in their name? Will they be banned too?
Non-violent extremism is not just difficult to define. Even if one could ban so-called adherents from public positions this would hinder, not help, the fight against terrorism. Facing the threat of terrorism means the government is obligated to exploit every possible avenue to prevent it. Mrs May�셲 policies exclude cooperation with the very people who might be best placed as discouragers of terrorism: those who hold혻similar �쐃xtremist�� beliefs but who are non-violent and are opposed to the methods of violence. Mrs May�셲 plans criminalise the eyes and ears you need to spot terror.
Then there is the need for unity. Even before the police publicly commented on the identity of the three attackers, the prime minister had linked the London Bridge massacre, last month�셲 Manchester suicide bombing and the Westminster terrorist outrage in March to a �쐓ingle evil ideology of Islamist extremism��. Politicians should take care in the language they use. Both al-Qaida and Islamic State have tried to claim the mantle of Islam for barbarism and death. We should not play into their hands. Mrs May should not have lumped together murderers and peaceful Muslims who are simply observant rather than violent, even if it might be politically expedient to use such words. Ukip trades in crude Islamophobia and perhaps Mrs May wants to ensure she is not outflanked when a shiver of fright runs through the electorate. It may allow her to paint, surreptitiously, her Labour opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, as tolerant of extremists. But such words risk pulling people apart when they need to come together.
Have we learned nothing from our own history? Listening to the prime minister speak from outside Downing Street, it is troubling to conclude that we have not. The wickedness that saw ordinary Londoners enjoying a night out mown down in the street and stabbed in bars must not mean we trade too much liberty for security. More than four decades ago in October 1974, a terrorist bombing saw people lose their lives and scores injured within a week of a general election. A few months later MPs voted for the Prevention of Terrorism Act, containing emergency �쐔emporary�� powers so draconian they needed to be renewed yearly. What were meant to be crisis measures became permanent. Current legislation reproduces much of the earlier problematic law, along with more intrusive powers. The aim of terror is to scare us into changing the nature of our democracy. Promoting sweeping new measures with alacrity in response to terrorist acts is no way to proceed. Politicians should steer public sentiment on matters of national security. But they should do so in an atmosphere becalmed by reasoned debate; not in the frenzy of the final days of a혻general혻election.
Last week�셲 attacks in Paris and this week�셲 arrests in Belgium and Germany have thrown the spotlight on to jihadis returning from Syria to hatch terror plots in Europe. The five countries deemed to be at most risk of attack are Belgium, France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.

The French government has created a smartphone app designed to send warnings directly to people�셲 phones in the event of a bombing, shooting or other disaster.
Two days before the Euro 2016 football tournament opens in France amid a high police and military presence, the French interior ministry unveiled its alert app called Saip (Syst챔me d�셙lerte et d�셢nformation des populations), which was developed after last November�셲 coordinated terrorist attacks across Paris killed 130 people.
Available in English and French, the app can be configured to receive an alert if an attack occurs near the user. In the event of a terrorist bombing or shooting, the smartphone screen turns crimson and displays the word �쏛LERT��, a brief description of what is happening and advice on how to react.
Although the screen turns red, there is no sound or vibration so that anyone who might be hiding near possible attackers is not put in danger by their phone sounding, the daily Lib챕ration reported. The user then clicks on an information button to find out if a police operation is under way and what to do.
The app is also seen by the government as an official counterpoint to possible inaccurate speculation on social media. Its alerts can be shared on Facebook and Twitter.
The app was initially configured to alert only on armed attacks and bombings, but officials plan to update it so that it can flag industrial accidents, floods and other emergencies.
Advice already on the app includes general tips on what to do in other emergencies, such as a nuclear alert, including �쐔ake cover in a closed building��, �쐂o not pick up your children from school�� and �쐂o not overcrowd telephone networks��.
The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said after the November attacks that he wanted to improve information to the public at a time of crisis.
Almost one-third of all referrals to an anti-extremism programme are for people feared to have extreme rightwing views that could turn into violence, figures show.
Tuesday�셲 figures, published after a van attack on Monday outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London, echo claims by Muslims who say the danger posed by the extreme right �� whether individuals inspired by propaganda or more organised groups �� is growing.
The stats from the National Police Chiefs Council show 34 people were arrested last year for offences driven by an extreme rightwing ideology.
Of 402 arrests entered on the national terrorism arrest database between June 2016 and May 2017, 34 �� 8% of the total �� were flagged as extreme right wing (XRW).
Channel, which is part of the Prevent strategy and aimed at catching people before they turn violent, saw almost one-third of all people it dealt with after concerns that they had extreme rightwing views.
An NPCC spokesman said: �쏻e are committed to tackling any and all ideologies which pose a threat to the public�셲 safety and security, and treat the threat from the far right in exactly the same way as any other toxic ideology used to spread mistrust and fear in our communities.
�쏦owever, the overriding threat to the UK remains from Daesh-inspired groups and individuals. That is borne out in the arrest figures, which show that between June 2016 and May 2017 the extreme right wing accounted for about 8% of those arrested for terrorism-related offences.��
In the wake of the van attack, the government is facing calls to treat Islamophobia as a hate crime that can lead to terrorist violence.
Muslims have long said anti-Islamic sentiment was being allowed to fester unchallenged. Miqdaad Versi, spokesman on security for the Muslim Council of Britain, said: �쏧t is reassuring to see a serious change in rhetoric by our prime minister to not only recognising the threat from the extreme right wing but also to explicitly calling out Islamophobia as a form of extremism.
�쏤or years, Muslim communities have been calling for action to tackle the growing hate and hate crime against Muslim communities, especially the tolerance of the spread of hatred on mainstream media.
�쏻e hope that there will now be action to tackle all forms of hate equally and that the government will fairly engage with Muslim communities.��
The van allegedly driven by Darren Osborne ploughed into pedestrians in Finsbury Park, with a man believed to be its driver shouting �쏧 want to kill all Muslims �� I did my bit�� after he was pinned down by some of his intended victims.
Dr Paul Jackson, an expert in far-right ideology at the University of Northampton, said the way Muslim communities were portrayed by some in the media created �쏿 culture of licence��. He also said the extreme right were targeting Muslims.
Jackson said: �쏧 think there is a very real problem in the way that neo-Nazi or white nationalist ideologies are seen as much more extreme or likely to lead to violent extremism when various cases have shown that Islamophobia can also lead to violent extremism.
�쏷he idea of someone being violently radicalised by Islamophobia rather than anything else hasn�셳 been taken seriously enough by the state.��
Theresa May and the police have said the attack was terrorist. �쏧t is violence motivated by a political cause �� that is terrorism,�� Jackson said.
Police say they treat extreme rightwing terrorism as seriously as other forms, including that from Islamists.
Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the Prevent strategy needed to be reviewed.
�쏷here is a widespread distrust because it is felt that it targets just one community,�� she said.
�쏷ragically, we see that there are multiple terrorist threats facing us, including the far right, al-Qaida or IS-inspired terrorists as well as others.
�쏻e know that a large proportion of referrals to Prevent involve far-right or fascist terrorism, but it is far less clear whether this is reflected in the charging or conviction rates. Terrorism affects us all.��
In the short term, the support shown for Muslim communities in Finsbury Park was providing comfort.
Resident Nurten Kocoman, 50, herself a Muslim, said she felt overwhelmed by the support of the community.
�쏧 don�셳 wear the headscarf, but I am scared for my mother who does,�� she said. �쏝ut I am so moved by these messages of support from non-Muslims, people are speaking up, everyone has come together, it gives me comfort and it does make me feel safer.��
With our attention focused on the election and its aftermath, the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London will inevitably be seen through the lens of electoral politics. Both the main parties responded to the attacks by reiterating how they would �쐊eep us safe��. The divide was broadly �쐒esources v powers��, with the Tories emphasising how they would pass more laws and regulate the internet, and Labour saying there were already plenty of laws on the books but that Tory cuts had left the police and security services lacking manpower.
But Europe�셲 issues with extremism are complex, terror arrests are at a record high in the UK and the tendency towards simple answers and easy solutions �� especially during elections �� is not without risk. European policing agency Europol has reported that there were 142 failed, foiled or completed terrorists attacks in eight European states in 2016, more than half of them in the UK �� although the UK�셲 figures differ.
So it�셲 no surprise that both parties talk about security. However, the term itself is open to debate. People will point out that cows, clothes and cars kill more people every year than terrorism. Some say the threat we face from jihadi terrorism is �쐕nprecedented��, while others say that, in historical terms, Europe is in a period of relative peace and that the larger dangers are from our own governments grabbing power in the wake of tragedy. Who�셲 right? Well ... it�셲 complicated.
Security expert Bruce Schneier describes security as both a reality and a feeling. The real risks of your children being the victims of a terror attack are low, but the odds don�셳 matter when it�셲 happening live on the news. Certainly, the raw number of attacks were higher in the 70s and 80s. That may be contributing to a greater sense of threat: if our baseline expectation of violence is minimal, attacks have more impact than if they are more regular.
However, Islamic State is actively recruiting, and we�셱e seeing what Searchlight has called a �쐅rowing Nazi axis�� in Europe. It would be unreasonable to suggest that the Manchester and London attacks definitely foreshadow a new wave of extremist activity. It would also be unreasonable to say that they definitely don�셳. We�셱e neither �쐓afer than we�셶e ever been�� nor in the midst of an unprecedented terror wave.
To point to the rise of far-right extremism in parallel with increased Isis activity is not to make a cheap �쐀oth sides do it�� point. There were 304 terrorism arrests in the UK in the 12 months to March, of which 113 were of white people, a 66% increase on the previous year. Any conclusions must be extremely cautiously caveated.
Academics have identified a process called �쐁umulative extremism��, in which extremist groups rely on the narratives of those they nominally oppose. Those familiar with Northern Ireland called this tit-for-tat violence. Extremists constantly seek validating actions by their counterparts on the other side to say, �쏶ee! We told you so! Westerners/Muslims are all like that.��
�쏻esterners�� and �쏮uslims��, of course, are groups of significant overlap. They are not in opposition, but extremists on both sides want them to be. Professor Matthew Feldman, an expert in extremism at Teesside University, explains that an often overlooked impact of extremist activities is that they make the broader community feel �쐄orced to pick a side��. Seen through this lens, the rush to demand that Muslims �쐁ondemn�� the violence, setting up new loyalty tests for ordinary Muslim citizens, reinforces the Isis/English Defence League narrative that Islam cannot be accommodated within European culture. The attack outside Finsbury Park Mosque last night has already been labelled a �쐒evenge attack�� by some, as if the broader Muslim community should be expected to bear responsibility for extremists. This is deeply toxic and counterproductive. Seeking to shore up bridges in the aftermath of an attack is not liberal appeasement but a vitally important part of any anti-extremism strategy.
The Manchester bomber and the London Bridge attackers were atypical in historical terms but match a recent pattern of Isis terrorists. They weren�셳 religious extremists who became radicals, but radicals who became religious extremists. Isis is targeting young men who are already angry, disillusioned and rootless, and giving them a focus for that anger.
The Egmont Institute published a report last year looking at this new wave of fighters. It identified a number of �쐏ush�� and �쐏ull�� factors that would draw people to Isis. Economic marginalisation, feelings of powerlessness, and a sense of alienation and racialised unfairness were among the push factors. Youssef Zaghba, one of the London Bridge attackers, reportedly became drawn to radical Islam following his parents�� divorce, which is in many ways a terribly mundane trigger for young men going off the rails.
Isis offers pulls that directly complement those pushes �� money, power and a sense of control, meaning and purpose. Islam is used as a carrier for those more visceral attractions rather than being the main draw.
White nationalist extremism tends to be more opportunistic and decentralised than Islamist violence. While hate crimes are known to spike after trigger events, this is often due to a mix of local and environmental factors that nationalist groups exploit and amplify, rather than seeking to organise in a top-down manner. Among other things, this means that such violence tends to fly under the radar of people who aren�셳 targeted by it, while dramatically affecting minority communities�� collective sense of insecurity and alienation. Religious extremism isn�셳 caused by bigotry, and bigotry isn�셳 caused by extremism, but when both factors co-exist they feed off each other.
Isis also sets up Europe as another front in the ongoing war in the Middle East. Again, this is not to say western involvement in the many overlapping sectarian conflicts in the Middle East has caused extremism, but to point to how all the factors in complex situations have to be considered.
Libyan rebel fighters told Middle East Eye that many of them had their control orders lifted because the UK government had �쐍o problem with people fighting against Gaddafi��, in a move that seems reminiscent of the foolish US strategy of arming Osama bin Laden to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. The west�셲 vocal commitment to its supposedly foundational virtues of liberalism and freedom stand in direct contrast to its determination to sell weapons to repressive theocratic monarchies if it serves its material interests.
What we�셶e been doing hasn�셳 worked, in part because we�셶e positioned analysis as inherently suspect, and shied away from answers that might upset voters �� or donors in the arms industry �� in favour of soundbites that appeal to our existing biases rather than challenging them. In the aftermath of tragedy, when people are looking for answers, �쐇t�셲 complex�� can be seen as an attempt to obscure or minimise people�셲 fears. But there isn�셳 a nice neat Hollywood narrative where the bad guys are out there and we just need to shoot them.
If we can�셳 understand how our actions will resonate throughout politically complex systems, we become passive participants in a cycle that increases the risks of the things we want to avoid. Actively working to reduce the risk of violence requires us to first understand and then to act carefully.
Britain will need to radically change its strategy to stop jihadi attacks because the threat is now at a �쐁ompletely different�� level of danger, according to the country�셲 top counter-terrorism officer.
Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, said the changes could cover police, MI5, communities, technology companies, the law and other policies.
Rowley outlined his blueprint as police admitted that Khuram Shazad Butt, the London Bridge attacker pictured in a football shirt with a hoax suicide bomb belt, had been investigated in 2015 but ruled out as a potential terrorist attacker.
The assistant commissioner admitted Butt had been categorised as not posing a risk of attack two years ago.
The investigation into the attacks involved two more raids on Monday in Newham and Barking, east London, as police tried to establish if the three attackers had any help. The Renault van used to stage the attack was hired just before the attack, police said. On Monday night police said that all 12 people arrested following the attacks had been released without charge.
Butt, Rachid Redouane and a third man not yet named by police hit people with a van on London Bridge and then went on to stab others on Saturday night. Seven people were killed and at least 48 were injured. The attackers were killed in a hail of 46 bullets fired by eight police officers.
The attack came after atrocities in Westminster on 22 March and Manchester on 22 May, with suspected attack plots foiled in between, one of which was by chance.
Rowley said: �쏧n nine weeks, we�셶e had five plots foiled and three successful attacks. That is completely different to anything we have seen for a long time. As the prime minister has indicated, we�셱e going to need to do some things differently.
�쏻e�셱e going to have to think again about the next iteration of our police and security service model, which has constantly had to innovate over many decades.��
He said of Butt: �쏻e will probably discover information on covert communications that were [not in] our knowledge that if we had access to those communications it may have changed our judgment.��
At a press briefing with questions mounting about what the authorities knew, Rowley said: �쏫huram Shazad Butt was known to the police and MI5. But there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly.��
Counter-terrorism sources have been warning of an increasing workload since 2014 following the rise of Islamic State and its declaration of a caliphate which 900 Britons are believed to have traveled to.
There are 3,000 people suspected of jihadi activity �� Butt was in this pool �� and 20,000 former suspects, who included Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi.
Rowley said more would be asked of communities to challenge extremism, and of the private sector, believed to be a reference to internet companies. He said the new government would �쐗ant to wrestle again with legal and policy issues��.
The Met�셲 commissioner, Cressida Dick, warned of a �쐍ew reality�� of terrorist threat after the attacks on London Bridge and Borough Market. Into this mix come fears about battle-hardened Britons returning from Isis-held territory in Syria as the terrorist group loses territory, adding to the threat.
Two of the attacks have come since the general election was called, catapulting security into the political debate.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, backed calls for Theresa May to resign, saying: �쏻e should never have cut the police numbers��. They fell by 20,000 while she was home secretary.
May responded that she gave police extra powers to deal with terrorism, which Corbyn had opposed when he was a backbench MP.
�쏪eremy Corbyn has boasted that he has opposed those powers and opposed the powers for anti-terror actions throughout his time in parliament,�� she said. �쏛nd I also support, absolutely, shoot-to-kill and I think what we saw on our streets on Saturday was how important that was.��
On Monday, 36 people remained in hospital, 18 in a critical condition.
The family of James McMullan, a 32-year-old from London, said they believed he was among the dead. His sister, Melanie McMullan, said police had found his bank card on a body at the scene.
It emerged that Christine Archibald from British Columbia in Canada died in the arms of her fiance, Tyler Ferguson. The French government confirmed that a French man was killed and French media reported that seven people from France were injured, four of them critically.
Crowds gathered outside City Hall for a vigil for the victims on Monday night where the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, laid white roses.
Police named the second attacker as Rachid Redouane, 30, who claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. He was not known to police and MI5 before the attack on Saturday. The third attacker has not been named.
Butt is reported to have associated with al-Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group whose leader Anjem Choudary has been linked to the recruitment of more than 100 British terrorism suspects. He featured in a Channel 4 documentary about British jihadis and was thrown out of a mosque in Barking for repeatedly challenging the imam.
Rowley said he had seen nothing to suggest mistakes were made in assessing the danger Butt posed in 2015, despite a member of the public complaining about him to the anti-terrorism hotline.
A suspected terrorist was shot dead by soldiers in one of Brussels�� main railway stations on Tuesday night after what police described as a small explosion.
Officers believe the man was wearing an explosive belt and a witness at Brussels Central station reportedly heard the man call out �쏛llahu Akbar�� �� �쏥od is great�� in Arabic �� before the blast.Police quickly announced they had the situation under control.
�쏷his is considered as a terrorist attack,�� said the federal prosecutor�셲 office spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt. �쏷he suspect has been neutralised by the military that were present at the scene immediately after the explosion,�� he said. �쏦e is dead.��
Van Der Sypt said the prosecutor�셲 office still had �쐍o idea�� of the suspect�셲 identity.
There were no other casualties in the incident.
Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a railway sorting agent who was in the station as the incident unfolded, said: �쏧 went down to the mezzanine level. Someone was shouting. Then he cried: �쁀llahu Akbar�� and he blew up a trolley.
�쏧 was behind a wall when it exploded. I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. [The suspect] was still around but after that, we didn�셳 see him.
�쏧t wasn�셳 exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big. People were running away.��
According to the Belgian newspaper La Libre, the man detonated a device after he attracted the attention of soldiers who were patrolling the station.
After the incident, which took place at about 8.30pm on Tuesday, the station and the nearby historic downtown area, including the Grand Place, were partly evacuated as police set up a security cordon.
The Belgian government�셲 crisis centre said bomb disposal experts had been sent to the scene and a controlled explosion was possible.
In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the Brussels police confirmed that only one person had been involved. A police spokesman told Reuters: �쏷here was an incident at Central station. There was an explosion around a person. That person was neutralised by the soldiers that were on the scene. At the moment, the police are in numbers at the station and everything is under control.��
The prime minister, Charles Michel, and interior minister, Jan Jambon, were following the situation very closely from the government�셲 crisis centre, a spokesman said.
Michel thanked the soldiers and security service and rail operator personnel for �쐔heir professionalism and their courage��.
The Grand Place is one Brussels�� most popular tourist destinations. The beautiful gothic square is a five-minute walk from the Central station and would have been thronged with people on a warm midsummer night. In the nearby Galeries St-Hubert, a 19th-century arcade of shops and cafes, people stayed indoors.
Brussels Central station is at the heart of the capital, as well as of Belgium�셲 rail network. After the incident, a security perimeter was put in place.
The metro, which passes under the station, was not stopping there and the Belgian national rail operator, the SNCB, said services were not stopping at Brussels Central, Midi and Nord stations.
�쏛 crowd panicked in the station and ran for the tracks after an incident,�� a spokesman said.
The Belgian capital has been on high alert for more than 18 months, since Brussels-based Islamic State militants carried out attacks in Paris that killed 130 people in November 2015, then bombed Brussels airport and the city�셲 metro in March last year, killing 32 people.
Two suicide bombers killed 16 at the airport and, moments later, a suicide bomb at Maelbeek subway station killed another 16.
Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by Isis and several of those involved in the bloodshed were directly linked to the November attacks in Paris, also claimed by Isis, which left 130 dead and were planned in Brussels.
In January, Brooklyn teenager Osiris Aristy was arrested for �쐌aking a terroristic threat��. If convicted, this would carry a sentence of up to seven years in prison. In part, the case turns on the use of emojis in some of the 17-year-old�셲 Facebook status updates. Among other posts, expressing typically teenage concerns, three now-deleted updates appeared to convey his disdain for the police using emojis of a police officer and a revolver.
This case is especially noteworthy as the basis for Aristy�셲 alleged �쐔errorist threat�� �� which falls under the New York legal statutes on terrorism (introduced after 9/11) �� does not include a written or verbal threat. Aristy�셲 arrest was primarily based on his use of emojis.
Emojis originated in Japan. They literally mean �쐏icture��(e)-�쓈haracter�� (moji). As you might expect, emojis are particularly popular among teenagers, where they can be used as a shorthand symbol to express an often fairly complex idea or emotion in a visually evocative and appealing way. But can emojis be construed as a language; one that can potentially fall foul of increasingly stringent anti-terrorist laws around the globe?
Emojis constitute a class of what linguists refer to as icons. Like the recycle bin or trash can on your computer desktop, an icon is a sign that, in some way, resembles the thing it evokes. The recycle bin icon on my computer is the place where I delete files. But in most cases, natural languages such as English or Japanese eschew icons in favour of signs known as symbols, which are quite different from icons. The symbols (or words) that make up a spoken language are meaningful, not because of any inherent resemblance relationship with the ideas that they point to, but rather, their meaning derives from an unspoken agreement between speakers of a linguistic community: the symbol will point to a specific entity or idea, agreed upon by all. This is known as a �쐋inguistic convention��. For instance, the same idea conveyed by the English word �쐁at�� is represented in different ways, across languages: �쐁hat�� in French, �쐀illi�� in Hindi, and �쐇kati�� in Zulu, for instance.
So, from this perspective, emojis �� icons �� function in quite a different way from the symbols used in English. Nevertheless, spoken languages do make use of some iconic signs. Many English words for animal sounds, ranging from �쐀uzz�� to �쐌oo��, are iconic: they resemble the sound produced by the animal they relate to, the bee and the cow respectively. And English is not unusual in this.
But language is not restricted to a specific medium for its expression. Since the 1960s, it has been recognised that sign languages, which make use of the manual-gestural medium, are fully functional languages, with the same levels of lexical and grammatical complexity as spoken languages. And as findings on signing have amassed, today we know that sign languages make extensive use of iconic reference, arguably far greater than in spoken languages. This is a consequence of the medium of expression: hand shapes and gestures can more readily depict an idea or entity, in iconic fashion, than is possible in the spoken medium. This shows that the once-heralded hallmark of human language �� that it predominantly makes use of symbolic reference �� may not be a hard-and-fast requirement for a communicative system. As emojis amount to iconic signs, ideally suited to the visual medium of expression, they are not automatically disqualified from being language-like.
Perhaps a better way of characterising a language, then, is in terms of the functions it fulfils. There are two very important ones: first, a language is used to convey ideas, and, second, to influence others. In short, an important function of language is to enable us perform actions, sometimes referred to as �쐓peech acts��, that can even change aspects of the world. These might range from the significant, when a member of the clergy pronounces a couple husband and wife, to the more banal, as when I ask a passerby in the street to give me the time. And from this perspective, the use of emojis, potentially at least, can be used to fulfil both functions: they can convey ideas, and be used to influence the mental states, emotions, and even behaviours of others.
In the case of Osiris Aristy, the issue will turn on whether a reasonable person would interpret his teenage disdain as a terrorist threat; or perhaps, whether his use of emojis was intended as a threat. And that is a slightly different issue. But, as emojis, and the way they are increasingly being used, share some of the attributes common to language, then, in principle at least, they could be used to make terrorist threats, and can be interpreted as such.

Theresa May has declared she is prepared to rip up human rights laws to impose new restrictions on terror suspects, as she sought to gain control over the security agenda just 36 hours before the polls open.
The prime minister said she was looking at how to make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and how to increase controls on extremists where it is thought they present a threat but there is not enough evidence to prosecute them.
The last-ditch intervention comes after days of pressure on May over the policing cuts and questions over intelligence failures, following terror attacks on London Bridge, Manchester and Westminster.
She said: �쏝ut I can tell you a few of the things I mean by that: I mean longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences. I mean making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terror suspects to their own countries.
�쏛nd I mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat, but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court.
�쏛nd if human rights laws stop us from doing it, we will change those laws so we can do it.��
The proposed measures appear to be an attempt at strengthening terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) rather than a complete return to Labour�셲 control orders, which were repeatedly struck down by the courts and then scrapped by May in 2010 when she was home secretary.
They could involve further curfews, restrictions on association with other known extremists, controls on where they can travel and limits on access to communication devices.
She could even increase the period for which terror suspects can be held without trial, currently 14 days �� a move that provoked clashes with civil liberties campaigners when Tony Blair attempted it after the 7 July 2005 attacks.
May told the Sun she would consult the intelligence agencies about what they think is needed: �쏻hen we reduced it to 14 days, we actually allowed for legislation to enable it to be at 28 days. We said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this. I will listen to what they think is necessary for us to do.��
The Conservatives have promised not to withdraw from the European convention on human rights during the next parliament but they could begin to try to replace or amend parts of the Human Rights Act after the UK leaves the EU.
It is possible May�셲 plans could involve seeking further derogations from the ECHR. This is the way the government is seeking to prevent human rights claims against soldiers in future military situations.Earlier in the day, the prime minister tried to return her election campaign to the issues of Brexit and her leadership, as the Tories�� poll lead over Jeremy Corbyn�셲 Labour remained narrow.
But she continued to face a barrage of questions over the impact of cuts to policing. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said planned cuts of 10-40% in London over the next four years would make it �쐆arder to foil terrorist attacks on our city��.
May was then repeatedly challenged about how the Home Office, police and intelligence services dealt with the information relating to the attackers, after Boris Johnson, her foreign secretary, said MI5 had questions to answer. One of the attackers, Khuram Butt, 27, had been reported to the anti-terror hotline in 2015 and a third attacker, Youssef Zaghba, 22, had been detained by Italian authorities in 2016.
Zaghba, named by police for the first time yesterday, was put on an international terrorism database for an attempt to travel to Syria in March 2016 which was thwarted after he allegedly told officials at Bologna: �쏧 am going to be a terrorist.�� But this does not seem to have been spotted by UK intelligence agencies.
His mother, Valeria Collina, told the Italian news magazine L�섷spresso that her son was �쐄riends�� with the two other men and monitored by Italian officials after his failed journey to Syria.
May said she �쏿bsolutely recognised people�셲 concerns�� and added that she expected the intelligence agencies to launch a review of the London Bridge attack.
�쏻e need to look at how the terror threat is evolving, the way that terrorism is breeding terrorism and the increased tempo of attacks. We have had three horrific attacks and we have foiled five others. The tempo is there in a way we haven�셳 seen before,�� she said.
�쏻e will look at how the processes were followed, what they did. They will want to be looking at that because they will want to learn lessons for the future, if there are those lessons to be learned.��
She added: �쏷he police and security service have done a good job in foiling a number of plots �� just five in the last three months, and a significant number in the last few years as well.��
May declined to say whether Zaghba had been monitored or subject to an exclusion order when he returned to the UK after being stopped in Italy, and declined an opportunity to apologise for any failures by the intelligence agencies.
Despite having previously said she believed the police and security services had the resources they needed to deal with terrorism, she went on to announce details of a proposed crackdown on terrorism at a rally of Conservative activists in Slough.
Her remarks suggested that if she is re-elected her government could look to step up the use of orders that restrict the movement of terror suspects.
There are currently only seven terror suspects considered enough of a threat to be given Tpims, while there are about 23,000 people considered to have been subjects of interest by the security services. Tpims, which expire after two years, can include overnight curfews of up to 10 hours, electronic tagging, reporting regularly to the police, exclusion from certain zones, enforced relocation and some limitations on use of a mobile phone and the internet.
Elements of the orders could be strengthened but any attempt to return to the 18-hour-a-day curfews imposed by control orders would be likely to end up in the courts.
May�셲 proposals follow criticism from Labour and other parties about her cuts to policing and approach to tackling terrorism in the Home Office, which she led for six years. Corbyn accused the prime minister on Sunday night of trying to �쐏rotect the public on the cheap�� by implementing 20,000 police cuts.
The prime minister has also been accused of politicising her response to the London Bridge terror attack when she addressed the nation outside Downing Street on Sunday. She declared �쐃nough is enough�� as she announced plans to
introduce new anti-terror laws, without going into details about what
she would do.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: �쏽ou can�셳 keep our country safe on the cheap. Theresa May is refusing to put in the resources that are needed. She has slashed funding for the police, our courts system and border force.
�쏧 will do everything necessary and effective to keep our people safe. We will always keep the law under review, but don�셳 believe would-be terrorists and suicide bombers will be deterred by longer sentences or restricting our rights at home.
�쏷he right response to the recent attacks is to halt the Conservative cuts and invest in our police and security services and protect our democratic values, including the Human Rights Act.
�쏧t is disgraceful that the Conservative government is suppressing its own report into terrorist funding. We will not shy away from the difficult conversations about who funds and supports terrorism.��
Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said May was only �쐏osturing about being tough on terror��. He added: �쏧n her years as home secretary she was willing to offer up the police for cut after cut. We have been here before �� a kind of nuclear arms race in terror laws might give the appearance of action, but what the security services lack is not more power, but more resources. And responsibility for that lies squarely with Theresa May.��
The London Bridge attack on Saturday night left seven people dead, and 15 remain in hospital in critical condition. Raids and searches of properties in east London continue, but 12 others arrested as part of inquiries into whether anyone else helped the attackers have been released without charge.
France goes to the polls on Sunday with terrorist violence casting a long shadow over its fraught presidential election, after the shooting of a policeman on the Champs 횋lys챕es deepened already bitter political divisions.
Candidates with radically opposing visions for the country�셲 future clashed openly over the response to the killing, claimed by Islamic State less than 72 hours before polling stations open.
The frontrunner, Emmanuel Macron, accused his two closest rivals of using the killing of Xavier Jugel챕, 37, and the serious wounding of two other police officers on Thursday night to score political points before Sunday�셲 first-round vote.
Macron suggested the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, with whom he is neck-and-neck in polling for the first-round vote, and the rightwing candidate Fran챌ois Fillon �� currently in third place �� were engaging in one-upmanship in their response to the attack. Hardline statements from Le Pen and Fillon spoke of a country �쏿t war�� with radical Islam, which they described as organised, expansionist, totalitarian and barbaric.
The gunman, identified by prosecutors on Friday as Karim Cheurfi, 39, had a long record of violence against police including two attempted murders.
Shot dead as he attempted to flee the scene after firing on a police van with an automatic rifle, he was reportedly under surveillance by intelligence services but was not flagged as a potential jihadi threat.
The US president, Donald Trump, offered a tacit endorsement of LePen, describing her as the �쐓trongest�� candidate.
The US president told the Associated Press that although he was not �쐃xplicitly endorsing�� the leader of the Front National, she was the �쐓trongest on borders, and she�셲 the strongest on what�셲 been going on in France.��
Earlier on Friday Trump tweeted that the attack would have a �쐀ig effect�� on the election, adding: �쏷he people of France will not take much more of this.��
Campaigning for the first round ends at midnight on Friday and polls suggest any two of four leading candidates could go through to the runoff on 7 May.
The French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the government had reviewed its extensive election security measures and was fully mobilised in the wake of the attack. He appealed for national unity and for people �쐍ot to succumb to fear��.
Cazeneuve said more than 50,000 police and gendarmes and 7,000 soldiers would be on duty for Sunday�셲 first-round vote in the two-stage election, and nothing could be allowed to �쐆amper this democratic moment��.
Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister running as an independent centrist, said in response to the attack that it was vital for people to summon a �쐓pirit of responsibility in what is an extreme period�� and come up with a measured response to �쏿 tragic event that has left our country in grief��.
�쏻e must not give way to panic, nor in any way allow any attempt to manipulate these events,�� he said at a press conference. �쏷he terrorists want to destabilise the country �� at a time when the French are deciding on their future.��
He promised that if elected he would create a presidential unit to �쐗ork around the clock�� to tackle Isis. �쏛 vigorous offensive will be taken to fight Islamic radicalisation, especially on the internet,�� he said. �쏷his is a moral challenge, a challenge for civilisation.��
He accused Le Pen of lying when she claimed she could have prevented previous attacks if she had been in office. �쏶he won�셳 be able to protect our citizens,�� Macron said.
Le Pen, widely seen as taking the hardest line on security, had earlier taken a characteristically tough stance against Islamic extremism, branding it a �쐀arbaric and monstrous totalitarian ideology�� and insisting France immediately take back control of its borders from the European Union.
She said France must engage in a �쐗ar against terrorism�� and accused successive French governments of being too lax towards fundamentalists. She demanded the immediate expulsion of foreigners linked to Islamism and flagged as suspects considered a potential risk to national security.
Those with joint nationality should be stripped of their French citizenship and expelled to their country of origin, she said. �쏷his war is asymmetric and revolutionary. It is a war in which all the population, all the country is targeted. It is obviously a war we cannot lose,�� Le Pen told journalists.
�쏷he Islamist, Salafist ideology has no right to be in France and should be banned. Preachers of hate should be expelled and their mosques closed.��
Like Le Pen and Macron, Fillon, the rightwing candidate whose campaign has been hit by allegations he paid his wife, Penelope, public money for parliamentary assistance she did not provide, cancelled planned end-of-campaign meetings on Friday.
He said France must show it was united, and not afraid. For years �쏧 have been warning that we are confronting an Islamic totalitarianism, in other words, an ideology that is radical, organised and expansionist,�� he said.
�쏧�셶e not stopped warning the government and my compatriots about the breadth and depth of that totalitarianism whose goal is to destroy our civilisation and crush all enemies from south-east Asia right up to west Africa.��
Cazeneuve criticised Le Pen and Fillon�셲 reactions, claiming they were excessive and divisive. He said Le Pen �쐓eeks, after each drama to exploit it to manipulate and divide in order to shamelessly exploit the fear and emotion for exclusively political ends��.
The Champs 횋lys챕es reopened on Friday morning having been sealed off for much of Thursday night as police ordered tourists back into hotels and blocked people from approaching the scene. Emergency vehicles blocked access and metro stations were closed.
France has been on its highest possible level of terror alert since the 2015 Charlie Hebdo and Paris attacks and the Nice truck attack of July 2016. Thousands of troops and armed police have been deployed to guard tourist hotspots such as the Champs 횋lys챕es.
This week, two men were arrested in Marseille on suspicion of planning an attack before the election. A machine-gun, two handguns and 3kg of TATP explosive were found at a flat in the southern city, along with Isis propaganda material.
Polls have suggested Le Pen and Macron are the most likely candidates to go through to the second-round runoff, but Fillon and the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc M챕lenchon are only two or three points behind, and up to 25% of voters have yet to make up their minds, making the race impossible to call.
Ragaa met Adel Abdul Bary, the man who would become her husband, in 1981. Her Egyptian family had moved from the countryside into a flat near the centre of Cairo. In those days she was a girl in tight jeans and a T-shirt, with long hair below her waist, though at her parents' insistence she tied it back in a plait, and was not allowed to wear makeup. At Cairo University, Ragaa found herself doing business studies instead of the art or music she had wanted to do, because her final school exam results were not good enough.
She hated her course but was entranced by the university world. Before long, other girls from her class, wearing hijab, began to take her aside and talk to her about how her beautiful hair should be hidden, encouraging her to come into the mosque area of the college. "I went," she says. "It was something different. I felt calm, peaceful in there."
Ragaa and her sister began to follow Islam more strictly than the rest of their Muslim family. It was the fashion for the educated young back then, she says. The two girls went to an all-female Islamic study circle where the male teacher sat the other side of a curtain. One day, Ragaa saw him after class in the street, a handsome man with a little beard and turban, and imagined how lovely it would be to be his wife. Later, his sister spoke to her about a marriage, and then to her great excitement, he and his family came to visit hers. The marriage was decided.
At the time Egypt was a tinder-box of political and religious tension. On 3 September 1981 President Anwar Sadat had ordered an extraordinary mass round-up of religious leaders, politicians, journalists, army officers and others. He mocked the girls wearing chadors, "going about like black tents", and the young men with beards. Sadat was assassinated shortly afterwards, during a military parade, by a handful of young Islamist officers, and was succeeded by another military leader, Hosni Mubarak.
After Adel's return from a year's study in Yemen, there was a formal written Islamic marriage. Ragaa thought the life she had imagined was about to begin but soon Adel was arrested like so many thousands opposed to the Mubarak regime. She spent six months travelling with his sister to every prison in Egypt to try to find him. When she finally did, he was a veteran of torture �� by hanging, electric shock and solitary confinement underground. There had been a period of hospitalisation, followed by ordinary prison. No one knew when Adel would be released, or if he ever would.
Tensions grew between the families, but Ragaa, for all her unhappiness, would not give up her marriage. "I was a stubborn teenager," she says. "Of course I resisted. It was pride. He was the first man in my life, and I wanted to support him, out of duty." Giving up her idea of work being haraam (sinful), she registered for a dressmaking course, only to have her sister-in-law tell her it was not allowed. Under his son's influence, Adel's father had also grown a beard; his sister was wearing a face veil. Adel himself had taken all the family photographs and burned them. So Ragaa stayed at home, and regretted it bitterly decades later.
Her husband came out of prison, but for those first years of their married life he was in and out again every six months or so �� torture became the almost unspoken constant of his experience, and for her a dark corner where she didn't want to let her mind go. "Miserable me," is her description of the person she had suddenly become.
Eventually Adel left for the US, and then later the UK. He had finished his degree in prison and was soon a well-known human-rights lawyer; he had strong contacts with Amnesty International in those years when arrests in Egypt of suspected opposition figures were in the thousands. In 1990, Adel gained refugee status in the UK, three years after he had arrived. Ragaa and the children joined him, and for five years they lived a quiet family life in London. Ragaa spoke little English, only went out occasionally, always with her husband and his friends and their wives. "He did everything, everything, for me and the kids here in London," she says. "And I was happy because he was with me, playing with the kids, taking us to the park �� it was the normal life we never had in Egypt."
In the summer of 1998, al-Qaida blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 220 people and wounding nearly 5,000. It ended that normal life in London. There was a dawn raid by British police in white contamination suits, brandishing truncheons and breaking down the front door. Ragaa and the children were traumatised. A dozen or so men were suddenly in their bedrooms, shouting for her husband, searching the children's clothes, tearing out pages from any books with telephone numbers.
Adel was led away, and Ragaa, hurriedly putting on her black hijab and abaya, was told to get into a bus with her five children, one of whom was a small baby. They were taken to a hotel where they stayed in their room for three or four days, without any information about why they were there, or how long it would be. She did not know how to phone her family in Egypt, and felt desperate and alone.
When they were finally taken home, she found her house upside down, drawers open, the front door broken and a metal gate across it. "I had absolutely no idea what to do �� he was the one who always knew everything," she says. After five days, however, her husband came home and family life resumed, without him discussing what had happened.
The British police found there was no terrorism case to charge Abdul Bary with. He was charged with possession of gas canisters, bailed, and then acquitted in a jury trial. (An official letter from the anti-terrorism police at the time stated that after nine months of exhaustive investigation, they found that he and the other Egyptian men arrested with him had no connection with al-Qaida, nor any connection with terrorism in Britain.)
However, six months later, Ragaa more than once noticed someone who seemed to be following them. Her old anxiety from the Cairo years flooded back. Her husband reported what she'd seen to the police. A week later he was rearrested. His extradition was requested by the US on exactly the same evidence dismissed in Britain the previous year. It had been sent by the UK to the US as part of the great fishing net of shared intelligence in the war on terror. His lawyers began to fight the extradition in a process that soon took on the character of Dickens's Jarndyce v Jarndyce in Bleak House.
An entire roomful of documentation built up. The committal papers from the US amounted to more than a dozen ring binders of documents, mostly in Arabic. Between 2002 and 2008, successive UK secretaries of state spent six years coming to a decision to extradite him. Representations for judicial reviews and appeals were made by his lawyers, including several medical reports, which over the years warned of his serious depression and risk of suicide in prison.
In those family milestones that mark a person's life �� his own mother's death, his daughter's wedding, his boys becoming men �� he was the unreachable ghost figure for his bewildered and overwhelmed family. Ragaa, unprepared in language or custom, overnight became a single mother, linked to her husband only by the daily telephone call from prison, or visits when a Muslim charity drove the family to Belmarsh, Brixton, Manchester or Long Lartin prisons.
"In the visits I left the kids to talk to him, play with him, sit with him, and I just watched," she says. "I thought about how unfair for them this is �� this is only how they know their dad." For her and the children the security checks for the visits were an ordeal, with women officers touching their bodies in the searches and police dogs sniffing them. They always felt hostility towards them �� for being foreign and the stigma of visiting a Category-A prisoner.
Years of dark depression inside the home crept past, Ragaa struggling with six children in isolation. She rarely phoned home to Egypt, gradually leaving the family bonds to wither. In 2004, her mother died. She had had no passport to visit her mother while she was ill, and she could not forgive herself for not being there.
As the children got older she began to hear about the London world outside her flat from the older ones, with stories about drugs, violence, knife crime and truancy among their schoolfriends. It terrified her. She took most of them out of school and taught them their GCSEs at home.
The exhaustion of doing all this, the weight of the responsibility, took a big toll on Ragaa's health. Money was very short. There was a time she slept on the floor as the family were a bed short, winters when she didn't turn on the heating. She developed health problems.
Her oldest daughter was married early to a cousin, something that Adel arranged from prison. Her babies were often in Ragaa's care too, as her daughter, with fluent English, took on the time-consuming and never-ending administrative battles with the local council or benefits office, set up hospital appointments for her mother.
One of Ragaa's two youngest girls wrote a poem after their father when he had been gone about six years. It was about her "honey-coloured teddy that was given to me from my Dad/Each time I looked at it, it made me feel sad." They wrote letters to their father, drew him pictures and talked to him when he phoned. All over the flat were the pictures he had begun to paint in prison �� some of bright flowers, but most heavy with the symbolism of prison: keys and cell bars. That atmosphere lay over the home.
Adel was stuck �� a bit player in one of the landmark cases of the war on terror, facing the prospect of lengthy pre-trial detention in a US supermax prison, a trial that none of his defence team believed could be fair, and then a possible life sentence. He and many others were named as defendants in the terrorism case called USA v Osama Bin Laden et al.
In London Adel's work had focused only on his own country, and he ran an office called International Office for the Defence of the Egyptian People. He put out a newsletter on Egyptian affairs, for which Ragaa, while looking after her children, used to write a weekly women's column.
The extradition case would put Adel Abdul Bary on trial with a large number of other defendants whose names were added over the years, charged with general conspiracy to kill Americans and with substantive charges in the east African embassy bombings. Ragaa blanked it out �� it was all too frightening to think about. The one concrete thing her husband was on trial for was his possession of a fax sent to him �� found in his office weeks after the events �� about the bombings of the US's East African embassies. (These faxes were everywhere in the Arab areas of London at the time, handed out in places such as outside the Regents Park and other mosques and sent to news organisations across the world.) This fax �� along with the al-Qaida defector Jamal Al Fadl's testimony on Egyptian Islamic Jihad's supposed al-Qaida links �� was apparently enough for the Americans to jump to the conclusion that Abdul Bary (never named by Al Fadl) had prior knowledge and responsibility in the bombings.
In 2001 three people were convicted for their roles in the bombing and a fourth for activities in the East African al-Qaida cell that carried it out. In 2011 another defendant, Ahmed Ghailani, was tried on 286 charges, found guilty on just one and received a life sentence.
For Ragaa all this detail, over so many years, passed her by �� she blanked it. "I don't read anything about it, I'm just not interested. Twenty years of all this politics has been too much. I have to live my kids' lives."
Ragaa enrolled in a dress-making course at a college of higher education with her husband's permission. It took her three visits to the college to persuade them to take her, because her English was weak. Every day she set off in the bus with her packed lunch and plunged into a class of giggly British women 20 years younger than her. The living room table at home became covered in cut-out paper patterns; she borrowed books, went to museums, searched the internet and sewed elaborate dresses that won prizes at her college. Ragaa's English made a leap forward and she ignored her acute fatigue, pain while walking and continuous confusion over benefit payments and the boys' schooling.
At the end of the year she passed with distinction and was accepted for a two-year higher level course �� although this time her husband told her he would prefer her to stay home.
He also told her he worried about her safety and preferred she did not make a trip to Cairo in 2009 when her British passport finally came through. But she went anyway, with her little girls and one boy. After 17 years she saw her own family again, and got a measure of how far the hard, lonely, years in London had taken her from an Egyptian life. Her family told her they found she had become cold and British.
In late 2010 her husband and the small group of Muslim men, all fighting deportation orders, were moved to Manchester prison while Long Lartin, where they had been for years, was refurbished. Soon the daily phone calls were punctuated with complaints about disrespect, racist behaviour by guards, new rules about phone calls having to be in English, not in Arabic. Manchester was so far that Ragaa did not manage to visit.
Then her husband told her he was going on hunger strike to protest about his treatment. The girls became convinced their father would die and spent tearful nights without sleeping, and days phoning their lawyers to ask them to make emergency visits to him.
Even after the Muslim detainee group were returned to Long Lartin, a new anxiety came to dominate her everyday life when her youngest daughter turned 10, and Ragaa's income support was reassessed. A Social Security or First Tier Tribunal assessed Ragaa as fit for work, despite evidence that she could only walk extremely slowly because of pain in one foot, and a sheaf of letters from doctors and hospitals about the various treatments she was undergoing.
Alternate Monday mornings became a humiliating ordeal as she went to sign on to get benefits. She did not complain, but her daughter, who went to physically support her and to translate, came back exasperated, with story after story of casual racism. She detailed the pain of experiencing open disrespect towards her mother, a woman in her 50s who had brought up six children, who was queried by a young official about why she "had never worked", or why she "didn't speak better English after all these years".
It is now four months since Ragaa and her children said goodbye to Adel in prison in Britain. Extradition had become inevitable in the autumn of 2012, after the European Court of Human Rights refused his final appeal. They brought his bed-clothes, his paintings and a few possessions home to London. The next day his usual phone call never came.
Since then, Ragaa has had only two 15-minute phone calls from Adel in his New York prison. He spoke to each child, leaving just time for a quiet word of greeting between husband and wife. Ragaa knows he is in solitary confinement and sees only his lawyers. The trial will be in October.
Alone in London now, she says: "My life, it is just my kids now �� but maybe, after 20 years of nothing but anxiety, maybe, maybe, I can say I'm recovering myself �� maybe."
�� This article was amended on 22 February 2013. The original said that "this vast case went nowhere until in 2011 one of the defendants, Ahmed Ghailani, was tried on 286 charges, found guilty on just one and received a life sentence." This has been corrected.
The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has acknowledged for the first time that stretched police resources in the face of four terror attacks in three months mean counter-terrorism operations cannot continue at an emergency level indefinitely.
Rudd has told MPs that police resources �쐆ave been pulled very tightly�� as they try to tackle �쏿 new phase�� in the terror threat, but has ordered a rapid review of the handling of the recent attacks �쐀efore rushing in with additional money��.
Her explicit recognition of the stretched resources facing the police came in the House of Commons in response to a question from former Labour police spokesman Jack Dromey.
He had pressed Rudd over a leaked letter from Britain�셲 four most senior police officers expressing concerns that the three-month emergency plan they have put in place was not sustainable and was diverting officers from child abuse and serious and organised crime inquiries.
Rudd insisted that the emergency plan, Operation Roset, was exactly what had been foreseen for the situation but she recognised the concerns of the four senior officers, who included the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, and the head of counter-terrorism, Mark Rowley.
�쏷he system is working. They needed the additional support because, of course, under these circumstances resources have been pulled very tightly given the additional work that is needed. There are different ways of addressing this and before rushing in with additional money I want to make sure that we get the right targets and the right answers,�� Rudd told Dromey.
�쏧 recognise what they are saying. I recognise that we cannot carry on that emergency level indefinitely but we are just going to be working with them to ensure we get the right response,�� she said.
Dromey said the legacy of previous cuts had led to neighbourhood policing, which was a crucial source of intelligence gathering, being hollowed out, while officers were being pulled away from critical areas such as child sex abuse inquiries and organised crime units.
�쏧n the aftermath of the four horrific attacks we have seen this year, Theresa May must accept responsibility for her legacy as home secretary. Now that her government has acknowledged the unsustainable situation that the police face, they must act to reverse their damaging police cuts.��
Rudd announced the appointment of David Anderson QC, the former official reviewer of the terrorism laws, to carry out a review of the handling of the recent terror attacks to look at what lessons could be learned from the official response. Anderson later tweeted that it would be �쏿n operational/internal review�� but he had not yet seen any terms of reference.
The home secretary said a second review of Britain�셲 counter-terrorism laws would also be carried out �쐔o make sure that the police and security services have what they need to keep us safe�� now that the country appeared to have entered a new phase of terrorist threat. In response to MPs�� questions, Rudd hinted that she may consider extending the use of Tpims �� the replacement for control orders to monitor terror suspects �� but said that would need parliamentary legislation.
Rudd also stressed the government�셲 plans to do more to force tech companies to take down terror-related content from their platforms, including the possible use of sanctions, and the intention to set up a commission for countering extremism that would �쐓tamp out extremist ideology��. She compared the new commission to the Commission for Racial Equality set up by Labour in the 1970s to tackle racism.
The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said Labour would look at any proposals for new terror laws �쐎n their merits�� but believed ministers should focus on providing more resources for the police and security services, saying it was resources rather than new legislation that was at the heart of the issue.
The head of US intelligence was exposed on national television yesterday as being unaware of the arrests in Britain of suspects in an alleged terrorist plot.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence, looked stumped when asked by Diane Sawyer on ABC about the arrests of 12 suspects in London and elsewhere around Britain earlier this week. "London?", Clapper asked, looking puzzled.
Later, the White House admitted that Clapper had not known about the developments in the UK.
John Brennan, the White House adviser on homeland security and security, said; "Should he have been briefed by his staff on those arrests? Yes."
The show was taped on Monday but hours after the arrests, which received wide coverage on US television.
The gaffe could make life difficult for Clapper as the post of director of national intelligence, since its creation after the 9/11 attacks, has been a controversial one, seen as an extra agency in an already crowded field, and without real power. It was intended to co-ordinate the work of the dozen or so US intelligence agencies but has yet to establish serious credibility.
Clapper's job is to brief the president each morning on intelligence developments.
One explanation offered is that he was focused on North-South Korean tensions. Brennan, defending Clapper at a press conference, said: "I know there was attention by the media about these arrests and it was constantly on the news networks. I am glad that Jim Clapper is not sitting in front of the TV 24 hours a day and monitoring what is coming out of the media."
Barack Obama on Sunday condemned an �쏿ct of terror and an act of hate��, after a gunman stormed an LGBT nightclub and shot dead 50 people in the worst mass shooting in American history.
The US president looked grave on what he said was an especially tragic day for lesbian and gay Americans, following the mass shooting at a haven for the vibrant LGBT community of central Florida.
The FBI identified the gunman as Omar Mateen, 29, a US citizen of Afghan heritage who was born in New York. He was killed when a police Swat team used a Bearcat vehicle to smash their way into the club and rescue 30 hostages early on Sunday morning.
The FBI special agent Ron Hopper told reporters Mateen had called the emergency 911 service before the attack, and spoke in �쐅eneral to the Islamic State��. Mateen was a known Isis sympathiser, Hopper said, and had been the subject of two previous investigations, closed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
He was interviewed repeatedly during those years, but the FBI was unable to verify any alleged ties to terrorists.
�쏦e is not a prohibited person, so he can legally walk into a gun dealership,�� a representative of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said. �쏦e did so within the last week or so.��
At the White House, where the US flag was lowered to half-mast, Obama said: �쏷oday marks the most deadly shooting in American history.��
The president said the full resources of the government would be used to investigate what he described as a �쐆orrific massacre�� and continued: �쏻e are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We�셶e reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer.
�쏷he FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I�셶e directed that we must spare no effort to determine what, if any, inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days we�셪l uncover how and why this happens and we�셪l go wherever the the facts lead us.��
The president, who had just met with FBI and homeland security officials, said families of the victims were �쐅rasping for answers with broken hearts��, adding: �쏛lthough it�셲 still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.��
He described it as �쏿n especially heartbreaking day for all of our friends and fellow Americans who are lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual��. They had gone to the club �쐔o be with friends, dancing and singing��, he said.
It was the 15th time Obama had addressed the country after a mass shooting. Less visibly emotional than on other occasions, the president made a brief reference to the gun control issue, saying: �쏷his massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that allows them to shoot people at a school, or a movie theater, or a church or a nightclub.
�쏷his could have been any one of our communities ... We have to decide whether that�셲 the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.��
As a stunned nation braced for a full tally of the victims, gay rights campaigners said they were �쐂evastated�� by the unprecedented attack on their community, which also left 53 people injured, many critically.
Buddy Dyer, the mayor of Orlando, said: �쏷oday we are dealing with something we never imagined and is unimaginable.��
Hopper, the FBI agent, told a morning press conference the case was being investigated as an act of terrorism. A US official, however, told the Guardian that while an unfolding federal investigation was in the earliest stages, an initial hypothesis regarding the shooter�셲 motive leaned closer to a hate crime than an act of terrorism.
�쏷he idea of it being terrorism is not off the table, but it�셲 probably not the principal approach,�� said the official, who wished to remain anonymous.
The tragedy happened amid an already febrile election campaign in which the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has called for a ban on Muslims entering the country because of fears of terrorism. In a sign of how the political tone could rapidly deteriorate, Trump first tweeted on Sunday: �쏛ppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don�셳 want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!��
Subsequently, Trump did not cite any sources when he tweeted: �쏳eporting that Orlando killer shouted �쁀llah hu Akbar!�� as he slaughtered clubgoers.��
In reference to a reported arrest in Los Angeles, Trump added: ��2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.��
The presumptive Republican nominee later issued a statement in which he called for Obama to �쐓tep down��, because he �쐂isgracefully refused to even say the words �쁒adical Islam�쇺��, and added: �쏧f Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words �쁒adical Islam�� she should get out of this race for the presidency.��
Clinton, the former secretary of state, was more circumspect. �쏧 join Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando, their families and the first responders who did everything they could to save lives,�� she said in a statement posted to Facebook.
Clinton did, however, call the attack �쏿n act of terror��, adding: �쏻e will learn more in the hours and days ahead. For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad.��
Clinton also called the attack �쏿n act of hate�� against the LGBT community.
After police said the shooter had an �쏛R-15-type assault rifle�� and a handgun, the shooting also stoked the debate over gun control. Obama has long and sometimes tearfully expressed his frustrations at trying to push reforms through Congress. He has described the 2012 shooting of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Connecticut, as the worst day of his presidency.
In her statement, Clinton said: �쏻e need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.��
NBC News said it had contacted Mateen�셲 father, Mir Seddique, who said: �쏻e are saying we are apologising for the whole incident. We weren�셳 aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country. This had nothing to do with religion.��
NBC News also reported Mateen�셲 father as saying his son reacted angrily a couple of months ago when he saw two men kissing in Miami. The Washington Post reported Mateen�셲 ex-wife said he was violent and mentally unstable and beat her repeatedly while they were married.
�쏦e was not a stable person,�� the newspaper�셲 website quoted her as saying. �쏦e beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn�셳 finished or something like that.��
America�셲 worst mass shooting unfolded over three terrifying hours at the Pulse nightclub, which was celebrating Latin Night. A drag queen from Puerto Rico was scheduled to perform, after Orlando�셲 25th Gay Days festival. The shooting began at about 2am. Anthony Torres was about to leave. �쏧t seemed fake,�� he later wrote on social media. �쏷his had to be planned.��
Torres wrote that he saw people �쐓creaming and running, looking for their loved ones�� and saw other �쐇njured people sitting on the floor��. He and his boyfriend, sister and friends ducked out the door.
A police officer outside the club moved to confront the gunman, the Orlando police chief, John Mina, told reporters on Sunday. The officer drew the gunman outside on to Orange Avenue, where they exchanged fire. Then the shooter re-entered the club and started firing again.
A survivor, Christopher Hansen, mistook the first sounds of discharge to be part of the DJ�셲 set. �쏽ou think you hear a song, it�셲 music, and then you realize no, it�셲 not, it�셲 real life, there�셲 somebody actually shooting,�� he told a reporter outside the club. �쏧t�셲 not OK. It�셲 not.��
He added that he knew the gunman must have had more than a handgun: there were too many shots. He fired dozens of rounds.
Staff at Pulse posted on Facebook: �쏣veryone get out of pulse and keep running.��
Outside, more than 100 personnel congregated, including officers from departments and agencies around central Florida, Swat teams, FBI agents and a bomb squad with dogs.
Inside, people scattered. Some hid in bathrooms. A local station, WFTV, broadcast several texts to family members. A mother recounted a text from her daughter and two nieces: �쒋�쁏lease come and get us. Please come and get us now. They�셱e shooting. They�셱e shooting.�쇺��
�쏦e�셲 coming,�� a man wrote in another. �쏦e�셲 in the bathroom with us.��
Eventually, the police made contact with the gunman, who had taken hostages. Mina declined to describe those talks on Sunday morning. The standoff lasted for hours. A mother, Mina Justice, said her son texted her.
�쏦e said: �쁇e has us, and he�셲 going to kill us,�� and that was it.��
Another mother, Lilbia Carmen, appealed for news on Facebook.
�쏯othing yet. My daughter is in there. Please keep praying for them,�� she wrote. �쏶he�셲 waiting for cops to be able to come out. I was on the [phone] and all I hear is shot guns.��
Carmen�셲 daughter escaped the carnage. The children of dozens of other parents did not.
At about 5am the police and FBI decided they could not wait any longer. �쏰ur biggest concern was further loss of life,�� Mina later told reporters.
Two loud explosions startled the press and survivors still within earshot of the club �� two controlled blasts �쐔o distract the suspect and gain that advantage��, Mina said. Then an armoured Bearcat truck smashed through a bathroom wall to free people while nine officers stormed the building, beginning a new battle with the shooter.
The gunman struck one of the officers with a bullet, but the man was saved by his Kevlar helmet, Mina said. The shooter was shot dead and about 30 people were rescued.
In addition to the weapons, police found a suspicious device on the suspect�셲 body. A bomb-defusing robot rolled inside, and they found the object was not explosive.
But the death toll surpassed authorities�� worst fears. They had estimated about 20 people killed at an initial briefing. After entering the club, they found 30 more bodies, 50 in all, and many more in dire condition, marking a death toll without precedent.
Later on Sunday, a 27-year-old man, who did not want to be named, showed reporters a bloody scratch across his stomach where he said a bullet had grazed him. The man said he had been standing at the bar, paying his bill, when the shooting started. He was carried across the bar by the weight of others rushing to escape, he said, and ended up underneath a pile of people.
When he was able to look up, he said, he saw about 20 bodies apparently dead or badly wounded on the floor around him.
Later, at police headquarters, people waited for news of loved ones. Brian Vieoma had been texting and calling his brother Luis�� cellphone since his family learned about the shooting. He had no reply and now feared the worst.
�쏦e came over for Latin Night. Venezuelans love to go dancing,�� Vieoma said of his 22-year-old brother.
Dyer declared a state of emergency, and alongside Mina, Hopper and a local imam urged Americans to give blood and unite. He told WESH-TV: �쏧t�셲 a tragedy of unimaginable proportions. My heart goes out to the victims, their families. But we�셱e a strong, resilient community.��
Dyer, who has been mayor of Orlando for 14 years, said he had �쐍ever seen anything like this. I hope no mayor ever has to see anything like this��.
Michael Cheatham, a surgeon with Orlando Health, told the press briefing local hospitals had implemented a �쐌ass casualty plan�� and spent the morning operating on a number of victims, �쐌any of them critically ill as a result of their injuries��. Blood banks in the Orlando area were straining under the effort to take in donors, the Orlando Sentinel reported, as hundreds come out to give for the victims.
The mayhem came in the month that Americans celebrate gay pride. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign �� the country�셲 biggest LGBT rights organisation �� said: �쏻e are devastated by this tragic act of violence, which has reportedly claimed the lives of at least 50 LGBTQ people and allies and injured more than 50 others.
�쏻e are grieving for the victims and our hearts are broken for their friends, families, and for the entire community. This tragedy has occurred as our community celebrates pride, and now more than ever we must come together as a nation to affirm that love conquers hate.��
Democrats ended a 14-hour filibuster in the Senate overnight with the promise of some progress on proposed gun control legislation. Republicans leaders agreed to take a vote on amendments to expand background checks and ban gun sales to those who are on the government�셲 terror watch list, closing what is known as the �쐔error gap��.
It�셲 unknown how Republicans would vote on the proposals. But in the wake of the nightclub shootings in Orlando, a small handful of them in the Senate are now showing greater willingness to compromise on the terror proposal than they did last December, when rival measures from the two parties to close the terror gap in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting both failed.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the White House, is scheduled to talk to the NRA on Thursday to help formulate his own policy position on the so-called terror gap �� a not-so-subtle acknowledgement of the extraordinary power that the gun lobby wields over legislators and candidates for high office alike. Here�셲 what you need to know about the terror gap.
The terror gap is the notion of a legislative hole whereby US citizens can purchase deadly firearms even if they are under investigation for suspected terrorist activity. The Government Accountability Office found that between 2004 and 2014, some 91% of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy a gun �� 2,043 out of 2,233 �� succeeded.
Attempts to close the gap, going back to the George W Bush administration, have repeatedly failed despite broad public support because of pressure on congressional legislators from the NRA.
Not entirely. The Bush and Obama administrations have both supported the same set of proposals, and the legislation most hotly contested by the NRA has been proposed jointly by Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democratic senator, and Peter King of New York, a Republican congressman. That said, Republicans tend to be in lockstep with the NRA more consistently than Democrats. Fifty-four senators voted against the Feinstein-King legislation last December, 53 of whom were Republicans. Just one Republican, Mark Kirk of Illinois, voted in favor.
The FBI has different ways of categorizing people it is investigating for possible terrorist ties. In addition, there is a federal no-fly list of people deemed too dangerous to be allowed to board an airplane. Some in the Senate, including Republican Pat Toomey, want to create a single consolidated list and have it subject to the authority of the foreign intelligence surveillance, or Fisa, court.
Feinstein and King want to give the Department of Justice, which includes the FBI, sole discretion over which terrorist suspects get to purchase weapons and which do not �� in part so that the FBI has the option of allowing sales to go ahead as part of their investigative process. Anyone who feels unfairly targeted would still have a chance to appeal against any denial of gun rights in the courts.
The NRA�셲 preferred approach, currently championed in the Senate by Republican John Cornyn, would require the government to respond to a contested gun sale by filing a brief in federal court, offering the targeted individual the opportunity to make his or her case in response, and convincing the judge to rule within 72 hours. Without fulfilling all of these conditions, the sale would go ahead. The president of Michael Bloomberg�셲 group Everytown for Gun Safety said this week: �쏷he Cornyn bill has an absurdly high standard that applies only to people who are proven to be about to commit a terrorist act. At that point, we shouldn�셳 be debating about terrorists�� gun rights �� just about the quickest way to incapacitate them.��
Among those seeking a compromise is Toomey, a Republican facing re-election in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He wants to address concerns about government overreach leading to people being put on a list erroneously by consolidating the many different ways the FBI has of tracking terror suspects, as well as the federal no-fly list, and putting it under the authority of the Fisa court.
Detractors on the left and the right are worried that a list of terror suspects used to curtail individual liberties would be prone to abuse and inadequate constitutional safeguards. The no-fly list has come under fire for exactly this criticism. Many people have not been informed that they are on the list, making it difficult or impossible to get themselves removed, and many others have not been given a reason for their inclusion. The American Civil Liberties Union is engaged in a five-year-old legal battle to challenge the constitutionality of the no-fly list and would accept it as a basis for denying individual gun rights only �쐗ith major reforms��.
The NRA, for its part, cites the risk of governmental overreach as a cornerstone of its argument for subjecting any contested gun purchase to the scrutiny of a judge. In principle, the NRA says it wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists, but in practice it has set almost impossibly high bars to making this happen.
Probably not. The Feinstein-King legislation as written last December would not have covered Omar Mateen because the FBI twice put him on a list of suspected terrorists and then took him off again. They now have new language, tailored to the events in Orlando, to extend a weapons purchase ban for five years after an individual is put on a terrorism suspect list.
Of course, there are many other ways to obtain an assault rifle and a machine pistol such as the weapons used at the Pulse nightclub than by going into a gun store �� for example, at a gun show, where there are no background checks. Another bill that will now go up for a vote to require background checks at gun shows is much less likely to pass.
Slightly, but don�셳 hold your breath. Senators such as Toomey and Rob Portman of Ohio, also facing re-election this year, are indicating an interest in finding compromise language. Feinstein, however, said on Wednesday that her own efforts to find a middle ground were not working. �쏧 don�셳 think it�셲 going to work out,�� she said.
Because, as Ari Freilich, a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, put it: �쏷he NRA sets the term of the debate.�� That applies even to a presidential candidate who famously claims to be beholden to nobody. The NRA has endorsed Trump, and Trump is doing what many, many other NRA endorsees have done before him.
The government and media have blown the Islamist terrorism threat out of proportion, giving extremists publicity that is counter-productive, a former head of Britain's intelligence service has said.
Sir Richard Dearlove, chief of MI6 at the time of the Iraq invasion, said that Britons spreading "blood-curdling" messages on the internet should be ignored. He told an audience in London on Monday there had been a fundamental change in the nature of Islamist extremism since the Arab spring. It had created a major political problem in the Middle East but the west, including Britain, was only "marginally affected".
Unlike the threat posed by al-Qaida before and in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks 13 years ago, the west was not the main target of the radical fundamentalism that created Isis, (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), Dearlove said.
Addressing the Royal United Services Institute, the London-based security and defence thinktank, he said the conflict was "essentially one of Muslim on Muslim".
He made it clear he believed the way the British government and the media were giving the extremists the "oxygen of publicity" was counter-productive. The media were making monsters of "misguided young men, rather pathetic figures" who were getting coverage "more than their wildest dreams", said Dearlove, adding: "It is surely better to ignore them."
The former MI6 chief, now master of Pembroke College, Cambridge University, was speaking to a prepared text hours after the ITV programme Good Morning Britain broadcast an interview with a Briton who had appeared in an Isis video saying he was recruited through the internet and was prepared to die for his cause.
Abdul Raqib Amin, who was brought up in Aberdeen, appeared in an online video last month with two men from Cardiff urging western Muslims to join the fighting with Isis. He told Good Morning Britain: "I left the UK to fight for the sake of Allah, to give everything I have for the sake of Allah. One of the happiest moments in my life was when the plane took off from Gatwick airport. I was so happy, as a Muslim you cannot live in the country of kuffars [non-believers]."
Amin added: "I left the house with the intention not to go back, I'm going to stay and fight until the khilafah [rule of Islam] is established or I die."
Dearlove said he was concerned about the influence of the media on the government's security policy. It was time to take what he called a "more proportionate approach to terrorism".
MI5, MI6, and GCHQ devoted a greater share of their resources to countering Islamist fundamentalism than they did to the Soviet Union during the cold war, or to Irish terrorism that had cost the lives of more UK citizens and British soldiers than al-Qaida had done, Dearlove noted.
A massive reaction after the 9/11 attacks was inevitable, he said, but it was not inevitable the 2001 attacks would continue to "dominate our way of thinking about national security". There had been a "fundamental change" in the nature of the threat posed by Islamist extremists. Al-Qaida had largely failed to mount the kind of attacks in the US and UK it had threatened after 9/11.
It was time, he said to move away from the "distortion" of the post-9/11 mindset, make "realistic risk assessments" and think rationally about the causes of the crisis in the Middle East.
The al-Qaida franchises that had emerged since had largely "fallen back" on other Muslim countries, Dearlove said. What was happening now was a long-awaited war between Sunni and Shia Muslims that would have only a ripple effect on Britain, he suggested.
Pointing the finger at Sunni Saudi Arabia, Dearlove said the Isis surge in Iraq had to be the consequence of "sustained funding".
He made it clear he believed more attention should be paid to security threats from Europe and China, which he warned was heading inexorably into the paradox of a "strong government but weak state".
A man who tried to inflict a mass casualty attack on Brussels�� busy Central station was a Moroccan national with possible Islamic State sympathies from the Molenbeek area of the Belgian capital, prosecutors have said.
Belgium�셲 security services are frantically seeking to piece together the last movements of the man, who was shot dead by a soldier on Tuesday evening after a suitcase bomb that he had detonated failed to explode properly.
The federal prosecutor�셲 office said it was clear that the city had been lucky to avoid a large number of fatalities and injuries from the attempted attack, which appears to have been sophisticated and carefully planned.
Authorities identified the man by his initials, OZ, and said he was a 36-year-old Moroccan national from Molenbeek. Local media have named him as Oussama Zariouh.
A search of his home uncovered chemical substances and materials that could be used to make explosives, said prosecutors, who have concluded that he had probably made the bomb there. �쏷here are also indications that the suspect had sympathies for the terrorist organisation Isis,�� the prosecutors said.
It emerged on Wednesday that he had been carrying a suitcase containing nails and gas bottles when he targeted a group of about 10 passengers in the departure hall.
The federal prosecutor�셲 office said he entered the station at 8.39pm, approaching and then backing away from the group. At 8.44pm he returned to the middle of the group, shouting and grabbing his suitcase. There was a partial explosion and the suitcase caught fire, but nobody was hurt.
The man then left the suitcase and pursued a stationmaster down to the platform. The bag exploded again, this time more violently, but the passengers who had been standing nearby had run to a safe distance, and again there were no injuries.
He then ran back up to the concourse, rushing towards a soldier and shouting �쏥od is greatest�� in Arabic �� where he was then shot several times. He died instantly. He was not carrying any further explosives on his body, contrary to initial reports.
Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a rail worker, told Reuters: �쏦e was talking about the jihadists and all that and then at some point he shouted: �쁀llahu akbar�� and blew up the little suitcase he had next to him. People just took off.��
The prosecutor�셲 office said it believed the man had acted alone on the evening and that it was not yet clear whether he was part of a wider terrorist conspiracy.
Although the bomb failed, its sophistication will set off alarm bells within the Belgian security services in the wake of a series of similar terror attacks in Europe: the bomb used to kill 22 people at Manchester Arena was packed with nails, and suitcase bombs were used in the March 2016 attacks on Brussels airport and Maalbeck metro station.
Tuesday�셲 attack came just a day after a man was killed when he rammed his car, filled with explosives and weapons, into a police convoy on the Champs-횋lys챕es in Paris.
Prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt said many lives had been saved by the technical failure in the device in the suitcase. �쏧t was clear he wanted to cause much more damage than what happened,�� Van der Sypt said. �쏷he bag exploded twice, but it could have been a lot worse.��
Hooded police and forensic officers raided the man�셲 home overnight, where they found bomb-making materials. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, said his country would not bow to the terror threat, which has seen soldiers become a permanent fixture at public spaces in Brussels.
�쏻e will not let ourselves be intimidated,�� Michel said after a national security council meeting. �쏻e will go on living our lives as normal. We have avoided an attack that could have been a great deal worse.
�쏧n three years we have been confronted with several attacks or attempts and we say the zero risk does not exist.��
Belgium�셲 national crisis centre said it was keeping the country�셲 terror level at three out of four, meaning an attack was likely. It said there was no immediate information to suggest that another attack was imminent �쐓o far��.
Molenbeek, a relatively impoverished borough with a large Moroccan Muslim population, gained notoriety after a terror cell based there mounted suicide attacks on Paris in November 2015, killing 130 people. Associates of the same group attacked Brussels four months later, killing 32 people.
The mayor of Moleenbeck, Fran챌oise Schepmans, told reporters that the man, who was divorced and unemployed, featured in police files in relation to a drugs case last year but that he had not previously been linked to any terrorist activity.
Schepmans said: �쏷he fight against radicalism remains the priority of Molenbeek. He had not shown up on the radar, but the police and the community continue their work. This attack strengthens our determination to fight radicalism and terrorism.��
Central station reopened on Wednesday morning. A mobile police command unit and several officers were still at the station and burn marks were still visible from the explosions.
Britain is facing a level of threat from Islamic State militants not seen since the IRA bombings of the 1970s, according to Britain�셲 new terror chief.
Max Hill, one of the country�셲 leading terrorism prosecutors, warned that Islamist extremists were planning �쐇ndiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians�� on a scale similar to those staged more than 40 years ago by the IRA.
The warning comes just days after Hill, who helped to convict the failed July 2005 London suicide bombers, was named as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, replacing David Anderson.
In his first interview since securing the post, Hill said militants were targeting cities and posed �쏿n enormous ongoing risk, which none of us can ignore��.
He told the Sunday Telegraph: �쏧n terms of the threat that�셲 represented, I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning �� with a view to indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians of whatever race or colour in metropolitan areas �� represents an enormous ongoing risk that none of us can ignore.��
He went on: �쏶o I think there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk that is at least as great as the threat to London in the 70s.��
The IRA abandoned its armed struggle for an end to British control of Northern Ireland and unification with Ireland in a 1998 peace deal.
More than 3,600 people were killed, including at least 1,000 members of the British security forces, during the sectarian conflict that began in the late 1960s.
British security officials have repeatedly said that Isis militants, who are losing ground in Iraq and Syria, will target the UK.
While Hill compared the severity of the threat they posed to the risks Britain faced in the dark days of the IRA, he said it would be wrong to �쐂raw a simple conclusion between Irish republicanism and the ideology of so-called Islamic State��.
Hill, who was praised by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, for his �쐗ealth of experience and legal expertise�� following his recent appointment, also expressed fears about the imminent return of hundreds of British jihadis who have been fighting for Isis in Syria.
He said: �쏧t�셲 an enormous concern that large numbers �� we know this means at least hundreds of British extremists who have left this country in order to fight �� are now returning or may be about to return.��
Last October, senior Obama officials anonymously unveiled to the Washington Post their newly minted "disposition matrix", a complex computer system that will be used to determine how a terrorist suspect will be "disposed of": indefinite detention, prosecution in a real court, assassination-by-CIA-drones, etc. Their rationale for why this was needed now, a full 12 years after the 9/11 attack:
On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on whether the statutory basis for this "war" - the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) - should be revised (meaning: expanded). This is how Wired's Spencer Ackerman (soon to be the Guardian US's national security editor) described the most significant exchange:
That the Obama administration is now repeatedly declaring that the "war on terror" will last at least another decade (or two) is vastly more significant than all three of this week's big media controversies (Benghazi, IRS, and AP/DOJ) combined. The military historian Andrew Bacevich has spent years warning that US policy planners have adopted an explicit doctrine of "endless war". Obama officials, despite repeatedly boasting that they have delivered permanently crippling blows to al-Qaida, are now, as clearly as the English language permits, openly declaring this to be so.
It is hard to resist the conclusion that this war has no purpose other than its own eternal perpetuation. This war is not a means to any end but rather is the end in itself. Not only is it the end itself, but it is also its own fuel: it is precisely this endless war - justified in the name of stopping the threat of terrorism - that is the single greatest cause of that threat.
In January, former Pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson delivered a highly-touted speech suggesting that the war on terror will eventually end; he advocated that outcome, arguing:
In response, I wrote that the "war on terror" cannot and will not end on its own for two reasons: (1) it is designed by its very terms to be permanent, incapable of ending, since the war itself ironically ensures that there will never come a time when people stop wanting to bring violence back to the US (the operational definition of "terrorism"), and (2) the nation's most powerful political and economic factions reap a bonanza of benefits from its continuation. Whatever else is true, it is now beyond doubt that ending this war is the last thing on the mind of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner and those who work at the highest levels of his administration. Is there any way they can make that clearer beyond declaring that it will continue for "at least" another 10-20 years?
The genius of America's endless war machine is that, learning from the unplesantness of the Vietnam war protests, it has rendered the costs of war largely invisible. That is accomplished by heaping all of the fighting burden on a tiny and mostly economically marginalized faction of the population, by using sterile, mechanized instruments to deliver the violence, and by suppressing any real discussion in establishment media circles of America's innocent victims and the worldwide anti-American rage that generates.
Though rarely visible, the costs are nonetheless gargantuan. Just in financial terms, as Americans are told they must sacrifice Social Security and Medicare benefits and place their children in a crumbling educational system, the Pentagon remains the world's largest employer and continues to militarily outspend the rest of the world by a significant margin. The mythology of the Reagan presidency is that he induced the collapse of the Soviet Union by luring it into unsustainable military spending and wars: should there come a point when we think about applying that lesson to ourselves?
Then there are the threats to Americans' security. Having their government spend decades proudly touting itself as "A Nation at War" and bringing horrific violence to the world is certain to prompt more and more people to want to attack Americans, as the US government itself claims took place just recently in Boston (and as clearly took place multiple other times over the last several years).
And then there's the most intangible yet most significant cost: each year of endless war that passes further normalizes the endless rights erosions justified in its name. The second term of the Bush administration and first five years of the Obama presidency have been devoted to codifying and institutionalizing the vast and unchecked powers that are typically vested in leaders in the name of war. Those powers of secrecy, indefinite detention, mass surveillance, and due-process-free assassination are not going anywhere. They are now permanent fixtures not only in the US political system but, worse, in American political culture.
Each year that passes, millions of young Americans come of age having spent their entire lives, literally, with these powers and this climate fixed in place: to them, there is nothing radical or aberrational about any of it. The post-9/11 era is all they have been trained to know. That is how a state of permanent war not only devastates its foreign targets but also degrades the population of the nation that prosecutes it.
This war will end only once Americans realize the vast and multi-faceted costs they are bearing so that the nation's political elites can be empowered and its oligarchs can further prosper. But Washington clearly has no fear that such realizations are imminent. They are moving in the other direction: aggressively planning how to further entrench and expand this war.
One might think that if there is to be a debate over the 12-year-old AUMF, it would be about repealing it. Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who heroically cast the only vote against it when it was originally enacted by presciently warning of how abused it would be, has been advocating its repeal for some time now in favor of using reasonable security measures to defend against such threats and standard law enforcement measures to punish them (which have proven far more effective than military solutions). But just as happened in 2001, neither she nor her warnings are deemed sufficiently Serious even to consider, let alone embrace.
Instead, the Washington AUMF "debate" recognizes only two positions: (1) Congress should codify expanded powers for the administration to fight a wider war beyond what the 2001 AUMF provides (that's the argument recently made by the supreme war-cheerleaders-from-a-safe-distance at the Washington Post editorial page and their favorite war-justifying think tank theorists, and the one being made by many Senators from both parties), or (2) the administration does not need any expanded authority because it is already free to wage a global war with very few limits under the warped "interpretation" of the AUMF which both the Bush and Obama DOJs have successfully persuaded courts to accept (that's the Obama administration's position). In other words, the shared premise is that the US government must continue to wage unlimited, permanent war, and the only debate is whether that should happen under a new law or the old one.
Just to convey a sense for how degraded is this Washington "debate": Obama officials at yesterday's Senate hearing repeatedly insisted that this "war" is already one without geographical limits and without any real conceptual constraints. The AUMF's war power, they said, "stretches from Boston to the [tribal areas of Pakistan]" and can be used "anywhere around the world, including inside Syria, where the rebel Nusra Front recently allied itself with al-Qaida's Iraq affiliate, or even what Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called 'boots on the ground in Congo'". The acting general counsel of the Pentagon said it even "authorized war against al-Qaida's associated forces in Mali, Libya and Syria". Newly elected independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said after listening to how the Obama administration interprets its war powers under the AUMF:
Former Bush DOJ official Jack Goldsmith, who testified at the hearing, summarized what was said after it was over: Obama officials argued that "they had domestic authority to use force in Mali, Syria, Libya, and Congo, against Islamist terrorist threats there"; that "they were actively considering emerging threats and stated that it was possible they would need to return to Congress for new authorities against those threats but did not at present need new authorities"; that "the conflict authorized by the AUMF was not nearly over"; and that "several members of the Committee were surprised by the breadth of DOD's interpretation of the AUMF." Conveying the dark irony of America's war machine, seemingly lifted right out of the Cold War era film Dr. Strangelove, Goldsmith added:
Nobody really even knows with whom the US is at war, or where. Everyone just knows that it is vital that it continue in unlimited form indefinitely.
In response to that, the only real movement in Congress is to think about how to enact a new law to expand the authorization even further. But it's a worthless and illusory debate, affecting nothing other than the pretexts and symbols used to justify what will, in all cases, be a permanent and limitless war. The Washington AUMF debate is about nothing other than whether more fig leafs are needed to make it all pretty and legal.
The Obama administration already claims the power to wage endless and boundless war, in virtually total secrecy, and without a single meaningful check or constraint. No institution with any power disputes this. To the contrary, the only ones which exert real influence - Congress, the courts, the establishment media, the plutocratic class - clearly favor its continuation and only think about how further to enable it. That will continue unless and until Americans begin to realize just what a mammoth price they're paying for this ongoing splurge of war spending and endless aggression.
Although I'm no fan of mindless partisan hackery, one must acknowledge, if one is to be honest, that sometimes it produces high comedy of the type few other afflictions are capable of producing.
On a related note: when Attorney General Eric Holder spoke about the DOJ's subpoeans for AP's phone records - purportedly issued in order to find the source for AP's story about a successfully thwarted terror attack from Yemen - he made this claim about the leak they were investigating: "if not the most serious, it is within the top two or three most serious leaks that I have ever seen." But yesterday, the Washington Post reported that CIA officials gave the go-ahead to AP to report the story, based in part on the fact that the administration itself planned to make a formal announcement boasting of their success in thwarting the plot. Meanwhile, the invaluable Marcy Wheeler today makes a strong case that the Obama administration engaged in a fear-mongering campaign over this plot that they knew at the time was false - all for the purpose of justifying the president's newly announced "signature drone strikes" in Yemen.
The key lesson from all of this should have been learned long ago: nothing is less reliable than unchecked claims from political officials that their secret conduct is justified by National Security Threats and the desire to Keep Us Safe.
Let�셲 get one thing straight: Theresa May is strong and stable. She is firm and unwavering in her stance to deliver her fantasy of regulating the internet and making it her own political playground.
May introduced the Investigatory Powers Act, aptly nicknamed the snooper�셲 charter, during her time as home secretary, and her time as prime minister has not changed her attack-dog stance on internet surveillance. After the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London Bridge, May continued on her warpath to decrypt the internet and make our data security weak and wobbly. As May stood outside Downing Street in the aftermath of the Finsbury Park terrorist attack on Monday, the prime minister announced that she would establish a new commission for countering extremism and once again, reiterated giving police and security services the powers that they need.
What this stance ignores is that many of those culpable for such atrocities were already known to intelligence staff (although not in the case of Finsbury Park). It is not sweeping mass surveillance we need more of �� it is police officers, so that we can have the resources to keep an eye on the true dangers, not the innocent millions who will be fished up in the net and caught in the crossfire of web insecurity.
When asked by the Evening Standard on 5 June about whether she would rule out implementing the levels of cyberblocking that China has in place, May did not say no, simply reiterating her point about regulation. No commitment to free speech, no worry expressed about aping the behaviour of a repressive regime. Her failure to win a majority does not appear to have shifted her position.
In May�셲 �쐖ictory�� speech, she swore to continue her crackdown on extremist Islamist ideology and suggested that she would give the security services the powers they need to keep our country safe. And by this, she seems to mean regulating the internet as laid out in the Conservative manifesto.
The snooper�셲 charter already forced internet providers to store browser histories and has asked technology companies, such as WhatsApp, to build backdoors into their messaging platforms. But I don�셳 think May realises her fixation with being the �쐅lobal leader�� in internet regulation runs contrary to the ideals of the internet when it was created �� that it should be a free and open network. That cannot be when the manifesto is telling us that the Conservatives would �쐏ut a responsibility on industry not to direct users �� even unintentionally �� to hate speech, pornography or other sources of harm��.
The manifesto says that she will �쐔ake steps to protect the reliability and objectivity of information that is essential to our democracy��. In other words, you can�셳 post something on Twitter and Facebook that isn�셳 reliable or objective. Tweets about May being strong and stable the only exception, of course. Who will be the judge of that? What would the criteria be? How would election campaigning such as �쑣�350m for the NHS a week�� pass any test as reliable or objective?
The Tory manifesto has a heading that reads �쐔he safest place to be online��. The irony is laughable. It is not safe when people are involuntarily forced to give away our data through backdoors into applications that are supposed to be encrypted. This will only serve to make us and our data more unsafe. We will be opening ourselves up to opportunistic criminals.
May is bringing in sweeping surveillance powers and hopes to restructure the internet in a way that will cause us to be at risk of hacking, thus leading to more terrorism and cybercriminality. Let us not allow the prime minister to hide behind promises that mass surveillance is key to keeping the public safe. Terrorist attacks have been around since before the internet and regulating what is said on the internet and seen on the internet is not going to change that. As Brexit negotiations get under way, a European parliamentary committee has only yesterday put forward draft legislation that would ban backdoors into end-to-end encryption and protect personal data from government surveillance, moving in the polar opposite direction to May.
The fightback against this has to begin now, because very soon, we won�셳 be allowed to make any noise at all. May�셲 government is crumbling as it tries to rush around muddling together something that looks like it has some iota of stability. In truth the only strength and stability May has ever demonstrated is in her commitment to bring internet security to its knees �� exposing our data to hackers and the government. She seems all too keen to bring us closer to the world Orwell dreamed up.
Good morning, Graham Russell here with the news to start your week.
Finsbury Park has become the scene of what Theresa May called a �쐏otential terrorist attack�� after a van ploughed into worshippers leaving the nearby mosque, killing one and injuring eight others. A 48-year-old man, said by police to be the driver, was arrested at the scene after being detained by passersby.
We have a live blog here, and the at-a-glance what we know so far here.
The vehicle hit the crowd shortly after midnight, and police soon declared a �쐌ajor incident�� in north London, deploying armed officers. Hours later, they said counter-terrorism police were leading the investigation. May will chair a meeting of the Cobra committee this morning.
London mayor Sadiq Khan decried the �쐆orrific terrorist attack��, saying in a statement: �쏻e don�셳 yet know the full details, but this was clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan.��
One resident who did not wish to be named told the Press Association: �쏱eople were just conversing, talking, just doing what we�셱e doing. And he just came into all of us. There was a lot of people. We got told to move straight away. I was shocked, shocked, shocked. There were bodies around me. Thank God I just moved to the side, I just jumped.��
Brexit talks �� The years-long process gets a little more personal from today, with David Davis set to meet EU counterpart Michel Barnier for the start of negotiations. Much has changed since they served as Europe ministers in the mid-1990s. Indeed so much has changed in the past six weeks that European leaders fear Theresa May�셲 government is too fragile to negotiate viable terms, bringing a �쐀rutal Brexit�� �� under which talks collapse without any deal �� that much closer. The EU remains unclear about what the British want from Brexit, following the electoral upset that deprived May of her majority. Sandro Gozi, Italy�셲 European minister, told the Guardian: �쏧t raises new uncertainties and there is a big question mark about the position the UK will take.��
Talks will get under way at 10am, continue over a working lunch, and wrap up with an early evening joint press conference.
Natalie Nougayr챔de says Britain is leaving just as the EU appears to be emerging from a decade of crisis.
Inside Grenfell Tower �� �쏷he conditions due to the fire damage verge on indescribable, which is why this will be such a lengthy operation taking weeks to complete.�� So says Commander Stuart Cundy as police released the first images of the devastation inside the tower block. He believes the number of people unaccounted for will rise beyond 58, with an update due today. A former chief fire officer has revealed how, before the disaster, a series of warnings about inadequate fire safety rules were ignored and urgent requests for meetings with ministers and action to tighten rules were stonewalled.
France elections �� In just 16 months, Emmanuel Macron has propelled his new centrist movement from non-existent to ruling party after Sunday�셲 second round of voting in parliamentary elections. The large majority of his party, La R챕publique en Marche, gives him relatively free rein to implement planned changes to labour laws, and overhaul unemployment benefits and pensions. A key question is what sort of opposition Macron will face, and who will lead it.
Prostate cancer �� A simple three-in-one blood test could transform treatment of advanced prostate cancer, helping to extend or save lives, British researchers believe. They have identified genetic changes that make cancer cells resistant to the drug olaparib, helping doctors tailor their treatment.
Portugal fires �� The death toll in the huge forest fires that have broken out in central Portugal has hit 60. Many of the dead were caught in their cars as they tried to flee the flames. Portugal�셲 prime minister, Ant처nio Costa, called the blazes �쐔he greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years��, and warned the death toll could rise. Three days of national mourning were declared.
Giving sugar gliders flying lessons, helping pygmy hippos with their parenting skills or nurturing abused red pandas: it�셲 all part of the regular duties for staff at Sydney�셲 Taronga zoo as they welcome new arrivals.

Brooks Koepka, the 27-year-old from Florida, has become the latest golfer to deliver on earlier and widely recognised promise after he passed a test of nerves to win the US Open. Pakistan produced a story for the ages as they defied all pre-tournament predictions and thrashed their much-fancied rivals, India, to win the Champions Trophy. Lions coach Warren Gatland has raised the stakes before the forthcoming Test series by urging officials to crack down on illegal blocking tactics by New Zealand players. The former UFC fighter Tim Hague has died after a knockout in a boxing fight. Andy Murray begins the defence of his fifth Queen�셲 title against the British No4, Aljaz Bedene, this week after Johanna Konta missed the chance to end a 36-year wait for a home winner at a British WTA event with a three-set defeat to Donna Vekic in the Nottingham Open final.
The pound is set for an interesting week as Brexit talks begin in Brussels. Sterling has struggled since the referendum and could suffer further losses if this week�셲 meetings set the course for a hard Brexit, which the markets as a whole don�셳 like. Despite the van attack in Finsbury Park, the currency remained fairly steady overnight at $1.277 and ��1.140. The FTSE100 is set for good bounce, meanwhile, with futures pointing to a rise of 0.74% at the opening.
The terrorist attack in Finsbury Park came too late for the papers, so the focus has been on Grenfell Tower fire.
The Mail splashes with a picture of the inside of one of the flats at Grenfell Tower showing a devastated kitchen with the remnants of everyday life burnt to ashes. The headline reads: �쏧nside Hell��. The Mirror has a different picture but the same headline. Metro likewise leads with �쏧nside the hell tower��.
The Guardian�셲 front has a picture of a little girl laying a candle at a memorial to the Grenfell victims. Its main story is on the turmoil in the Conservative party and what it means for Brexit. The Telegraph splash is also on the Tories. But it will be alarming for Theresa May in its almost causal acceptance that she is out as PM. �쏡avid Davis tipped to be interim Tory leader�� it says, claiming that allies of Boris Johnson believe the Brexit secretary is the �쐕nity candidate��.
The Times tells of �쐁haos�� looking after the Grenfell survivors with some rehoused hundreds of kilometres from London and others being given only 짙20. �쏤ire victims left in lurch by chaotic relief effort�� is the headline. The i has �쏷ragedy caused by years of neglect.��
The FT meanwhile leads with �쏦ammond urges focus on business in Brexit talks�� and says the chancellor has both confirmed that the UK would leave the customs union and single market but wanted to leave �쐖ia a slope not a cliff edge��.
The Sun meanwhile concentrates on the personal troubles of Britain�셲 Got Talent host Ant McPartlin for its main story.

A mock terrorist attack has been carried out at one of the UK�셲 busiest shopping centres, in a marauding assault similar to the Paris and Brussels atrocities.
More than 800 volunteers took part in the staged attack at the Trafford Centre in Manchester on Monday night.
As part of the drill a fake suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a packed food court at the shopping centre.
The volunteers, wearing ear defenders and safety glasses, screamed out as if they were in pain as the training exercise unfolded.
A second masked gunman then appeared at the entrance to the food court and fired a number of blank rounds.
Media organisations were then taken outside to witness the arrival, five minutes later, of armed police.
Two police marksmen moved towards the mock terrorist, ignoring the injured in a new tactic to save lives outlined by Scotland Yard following a similar training exercise in December.
The Trafford Centre mock attack, five months in the planning, then continued in the media�셲 absence until 6am.
Greater Manchester police sought to reassure people that there is no specific intelligence of an attack on the shopping centre, six miles west of Manchester city centre:
The shopping centre will be open as usual on Tuesday, although the training exercise is due to continue unseen at unnamed locations until Wednesday, when it will finish in Merseyside.
Counter-terror officers have stepped up their planning for a marauding-style terror attack following the atrocities in Paris last year and Brussels in March.
In Brussels, 32 people were killed and more than 300 injured when three suicide bombers detonated explosives in the airport and Maelbeek metro station.
In November last year, 130 people were killed when three suicide bombers struck near the Stade de France in St-Denis, Paris, followed by suicide bombings and mass shootings at cafes, restaurants and the Bataclan music venue.
This isn�셳 writing, this is fingers stamping on computer keys with the distracted force of 10 feet in shoes too tight. People often describe moods as clouds, dark and damp, hovering, but I have worn a corset in my life, and that feeling of restriction and breathlessness is a more accurate description. Yeah, I�셫 in a bad mood, consider this my coming out.
Because such an admission is almost taboo right now, in these days of Blitz spirit and blessings counted, when, after the New York Times described Britain as �쐒eeling�� following the terrorist attacks, the correct response was deemed to be a universally dismissive snort. Across the internet, people who wanted to show they were completely fine, actually, shared examples of things that really made them reel, like tea made in the microwave and people who eat KitKats wrong.
And while I enjoy a nice internet joke as much as the next sub-millennial chancer, the absolute denial of emotion, the infuriating tweeness has, if not left me reeling, certainly sent me a little spinny.
It happened too when the official threat level was raised to critical. Down tumbled that famous British humour like an Only Fools and Horses chandelier, with the hashtag #BritishThreatLevels. Lots of jokes about queues and meetings and tea, obviously. �쏛 rail replacement bus service can be found outside the station concourse.�� �쏹nexpected item in the bagging area�� #BritishThreatLevels. Call me a joy-sucking, doom-bathing grinch made of rust, but I didn�셳 get it. There was a genuine threat and people died, and God, the version of Englishness displayed was all about smallness and mundanity. For the people it cheered, lovely. For me, feeling angry, sad, and sometimes scared, along with the roaring reminders that unless we laugh they�셱e winning, it meant I burrowed away a little deeper.
I dug into the soil of my mood. I got it under my nails. Walking through the world with this mood in my blood is like being born again, you know something nobody else does, the true bitterness of a suburb on a Sunday, the lazy arrogance of a wheeled suitcase. I�셪l be trundling through the supermarket when the mood will take me again, encase me in its horrid cuddle. Corsets don�셳 just make your waist smaller, they compress organs, including, if tightly laced, your heart. You feel a permanent sort of grief, in a corset, as if you�셱e being dumped every half hour by someone you like.
The worst side effect of Britain�셲 Keep Calm and Chuckle About Tea mentality, I�셫 finding, is that it ends up feeling dehumanising, on quite a personal level. You�셱e not allowed to just feel�� pissed off. It lets the side down. To feel annoyed about a bad dinner, because of �쏷rump��, or to get irritated about lateness, because, Eva, there are bigger problems in the world. In order for life to go on as normal, the thinking is, we all need to be as one. One jolly, amorphous, hashtag-enjoying, stiff-upper-lipped nation, laughing in the face of terrorism as only Brits can. Which leaves very little room for being an individual, with all the fear and pain that implies.
I want to be able to admit to feeling scared at rush hour, even if it�셲 not rational and there�셲 more chance of what, being shat on by a poisonous pigeon than being murdered on the Northern Line? I want to be able to say it�셲 terrifying without being told that simply saying that is playing into the terrorists�� hands. I even get angry about other people�셲 anger. I get caught in cycles of dick. I see somebody behaving dickishly, which angers me, but then the pile-on of alterna-dicks telling them why they�셱e wrong, the bonfire of the dicks, angers me even more. I�셫 sure I�셫 not alone.
So, if your colleagues make jokes that make you feel empty, join me. If the anxiety of your daily commute fills you up like carbs, join me. If you feel lost in yourself, if yesterday made you sad, if tomorrow makes you nervous, if you�셱e considering shouting at a stranger on the bus unless he moves his elbow right now, Sir, join me. If all this makes you feel lonely, or hopeless, or simply scared, join me. If you�셱e down and troubled, and you need a place to scream into a pillow for a very long time, join me. The bad mood club is open.

Three terror attacks in three months have left the British security services desperately searching for ways to prevent another atrocity being committed in our streets.
But the frightening reality is that terrorism has become impossible to police. The attacks in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge were carried out by extremists who had nothing in common apart from a view of the world that places the murder of innocent people at the heart of a warped ideology. Their different ages, ethnicities and social backgrounds demonstrate the size of the task now facing counter-terrorism agencies in this country.
The Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, a Muslim convert in his early 50s, had for many years lived a relatively stable life in the home counties. Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi, a 24-year-old Mancunian, had fought on the frontline in Libya; while London Bridge ringleader Khuram Butt, a 27-year-old from east London, was an extremist living so much in plain view that he had featured in a Channel 4 documentary on extremism.
These men were all born or raised in Britain and radicalised in very different ways. Although Scotland Yard and MI5 were aware of them, there is no evidence that the men ever knew each other. Their circumstances comprise such a wide spectrum of behaviour, associations and life histories that they do not fit a straightforward terrorist profile.
Of urgent concern for the security services is understanding why Masood, Abedi, Butt and the third London Bridge attacker, Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian, were all known to them but were not stopped.
The answer is that the security services were �� and are �� drowning in the sheer volume of police reports, intelligence and referrals from members of the public.
Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command, MI5 and GCHQ share a database of 23,000 subjects of interest. Of these, they have prioritised 3,000 who they believe pose the greatest threat. Under MI5�셲 traffic-light system, a further 500 are given the highest priority and are being investigated as part of ongoing counter-terrorism operations.
But the security services must also혻contend with tens of thousands of혻other혻names that have been brought혻�벬쟯r should have been brought �벬쟴o their혻attention, including 3,000-4,000 arrests and many more who have been stopped and questioned by the police.
There are people who may have, from혻time to time, expressed extremist views, which in turn have led to referrals혻to the Prevent programme (8,000 in the last year) or the anti-terror hotline. Some referrals may include reports of an individual�셲 support on social media for a caliphate, or a desire to live in a country ruled by sharia law. Other reports may include references to conversations where someone has said they believe Muslims혻have the right to defend themselves혻with violence when they are attacked, or혻that Israel has no right to exist.
The security services and Prevent teams are inundated with these kinds of referrals, all of which must be investigated. At the same time police and MI5 officers are already committed to hundreds of counter-terror investigations and inquiries. MI5 must try to assess which of the thousands of cases matching the government�셲 fluid definition of extremism deserve resources.
In essence, they are trying to establish the crucial moment when a nonviolent view of the world turns to thoughts혻of terrorism. The easier cases are those that exhibit a criminal profile: attempting to obtain weapons, buying explosives ingredients or evidence of attack planning. And these are indeed the clues that have led to 18 terror plots since 2013 being thwarted, including five in the last two months.
But the dumbed-down terror attacks of Westminster and London Bridge are examples where there may be just days between planning and execution.
Khuram Butt illustrates exactly how difficult the science of terrorist detection has become: even when someone gleefully advertises their extremism, the police still need intelligence of attack planning before they can act.
There are hundreds of young men like Butt who express extremist views but stay on the right side of the law. Butt had been risk-assessed but dismissed because he had not shown any interest in domestic terrorism. Perhaps the police were beguiled by the belief that members of groups such as Anjem Choudary�셲 al-Muhajiroun, or those following the Islamist clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, observed a �쐁ovenant of security��, whereby Islamists living in the UK vow not to carry out acts of domestic terrorism.
Theresa May�셲 plans for tougher control orders, longer prison sentences or human rights-busting deportations would not have stopped any of the recent terror attacks. These measures all require intelligence that demonstrates that an individual poses a threat. None of the recent killers had been assessed in such a way, and so were not subjects of interest placed under surveillance.
Years of counter-terrorism policies directed against Islamic communities have made young Muslims deeply suspicious of the police. It is unfortunate but true that before each of the major terror attacks committed in the UK since and including the 7/7 London bombings, the security services had knowledge of, or even dealings with, at least one of the suspects. In each case it was a lack of hard intelligence that혻left혻the men unhindered to carry out their killings. It is vital that resources are now혻directed at mending the broken links in the vital chain of intelligence that flows from the community to the authorities.
The three terrorists who struck London Bridge last Saturday tried to hire a 7.5-tonne lorry on the morning of the attack to kill even more people and inflict a bigger atrocity on Britain.
Early on Saturday morning police investigating the attack made raids in east London and arrested two more people on suspicion of terror offences, bringing the number being held to seven. A 27-year-old man was detained at a house in Ilford and a 28-year-old man at a house in Barking.
Five other people were already in custody as detectives and MI5 investigate if anyone assisted the London Bridge terrorists or had knowledge of their plans go run people over and go on a stabbing rampage. Eight people were killed and 48 wounded in the attack.
The van they used was hired by the ringleader, named by police as Khuram Butt. Police believe the intended atrocity was on a similar scale to that in Nice, France, in August 2016 when a truck drove into a crowd and left 86 people dead.
The attempted truck hire failed only by chance, because Butt failed to provide payment details. Instead they hired a Renault van from a firm in Harold Hill, Romford, in east London.
Commander Dean Haydon, of Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command, said: �쏞oncerningly, Butt had earlier attempted to hire a 7.5-tonne lorry that same morning. When he did not provide payment details, the rental did not go ahead. The effects could have been even worse.��
Scotland Yard gave their fullest detail yet of the attack last Saturday, the third to strike Britain in three months, amid debate about tougher measures, impacting on civil liberties, to protect the United Kingdom against an unprecedented terrorism threat.
The attackers drove to London Bridge at 9.58pm. They drove up and down twice as a practice run, or by way of reconnaissance, before U-turning and then mowing down people in the van, driven by Butt. Three people were killed there, with one, French tourist Xavier Thomas, knocked into the river Thames as he walked with his girlfriend on a summer evening.
The trio then took knives they had bought, tied to their wrists with leather straps. All three had the same type of pink 12-inch kitchen knife with a ceramic blade. After crashing their hired van into railings, they first went off on their own to attack people, then regrouped to rampage through Borough market.
They had wrapped water bottles in grey tape to look like a suicide belt, strung around their upper bodies. As they set upon a young man passing by, armed police rushed towards the terrorists to save him. The police opened fire and killed the attackers in a hail of 46 bullets. At least two officers came under direct attack from the jihadis.
Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were all killed by police. One passerby was shot in the head by a police bullet.
Three people died after being hit by the van and five were stabbed to death in the attack led by Butt.
In the van police found 13 wine bottles containing flammable liquid with rags stuffed in them, essentially Molotov cocktails, and blow torches to ignite them, potentially meant for another wave of attacks. There were also bags of gravel, chairs and a suitcase meant to hide their murderous intent if the rental company or friends asked why they had hired a van.
The counter-terrorism command believes an east London flat rented since April by Redouane was the safe house where they prepared their attack. Detectives recovered craft knives from the flat used to cut the leather straps attached to the knives, lighter fluid used in the petrol bombs and other materials linking it directly to the attack.
Butt had been investigated by MI5 in 2015 but slipped off their radar after they found no evidence of attack planning or any crime. He was an acolyte of Anjem Choudary, an extremist cleric whose groups were believed by security officials to be a gateway to terrorism, with MI5 assessing that 500 people linked to them went on to commit terrorist acts.
Haydon said he expected more arrests and searches as the inquiry continued against a backdrop of unprecedented attack planning and terrorist threat level.
Haydon said his teams were working flat out: �쏻e also need to watch out for those who may be inspired by these recent attacks.�� He asked firms to report people they are suspicious of who are trying to hire vehicles or trucks for �쐍o particular reason��.
He said the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was a trigger factor for the upsurge, and it ends in just over a fortnight.
The van used was booked out at 5.50pm on the evening of the attack, using a recently activated mobile phone bought by Butt, and was due to be returned at 10am the next morning.
It was picked up at 6.30pm and by 7.17pm it arrived at a Barking address used by Zaghba.
At 7.38pm the attackers left the address and drove from east London to just south of the centre of the capital.
By 9.58pm they drove north to south across London Bridge in the first of the two reconnaissance runs, and then started the attack. The first 999 call to police was at 10.08pm, with police having shot them dead eight minutes later.
At the time of the attack, Butt was on bail for a non-terrorist offence, of trying to defraud a bank. Police said the CPS has decided they would not prosecute him. He also had two cautions, one in 2008 for fraud, and one in 2010 for assault. The other two had no criminal record in the UK and inquiries found none in countries they had links to. In Zaghba�셲 case that was Italy where he lived and Morocco, in Redouane �셲 case that was Ireland as well as Morocco and Libya.
Extra protection against vehicle attacks are now being put on eight London bridges including at Westminster, Waterloo, Lambeth, Tower Bridge, Blackfriars and Vauxhall. Urgent security reviews are being carried out for all events, including summer music festivals.
Japan has passed a controversial law targeting conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes, despite a warning by the UN that it could be used to crack down on civil liberties.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner pushed the bill through the upper house of Japan�셲 parliament as thousands of people protested outside.
The vote on the bill, which has been delayed three times amid widespread public opposition, came after a UN expert called the legislation �쐂efective��, eliciting an angry response from Japan�셲 prime minister, Shinzo Abe.
Officials in Tokyo insist the law is needed to ratify a 2000 UN treaty targeting global organised crime, and to improve Japan�셲 anti-terrorism measures as it prepares to host the rugby world cup in 2019 and the Olympics the following year.
�쏧t�셲 only three years until the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and so I�셝 like to ratify the treaty on organised crime as soon as possible so we can firmly cooperate with international society to prevent terrorism,�� Abe told reporters. �쏷hat�셲 why the law was enacted.��
The legislation would criminalise plotting and preparing to commit 277 �쐓erious crimes��.
But the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and other critics point out that offences covered by the law include those with no obvious connection to terrorism or organised crime, such as sit-ins to protest construction of apartment buildings or copying music.
Opponents see the legislation as part of Abe�셲 broader mission to increase state powers, and fear ordinary citizens could be targeted, despite government assurances to the contrary.
Renho Murata, leader of the opposition Democratic party, said Abe�셲 administration had pushed through a �쐀rutal�� law that would infringe on freedom of thought.
Critics fear that the law, combined with a widening of legal wiretapping and the reluctance of courts to limit police surveillance powers, could deter grassroots opposition to government policies.
To try to speed up passage of the law, the ruling bloc took the rare, contentious step of skipping a vote in an upper house committee and moving directly to a vote in the full upper house.
Joseph Cannataci, the UN special rapporteur on the right to privacy, wrote to Abe last month asking him to address the risk that the changes could �쐋ead to undue restrictions to the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression��.
Abe described Cannataci�셲 assessment as �쐃xtremely unbalanced�� and said his conduct was �쐆ardly that of an objective expert��.
Cannataci said on Thursday that the Japanese government had used �쐔he psychology of fear�� to push through �쐂efective legislation��.
He added: �쏪apan needs to improve its safeguards for privacy, now even more so that this suspicious piece of legislation has been put on the statute books.��
Critics say gathering information on possible plots would require expanded police surveillance, and the legislation has been compared to Japan�셲 �쐔hought police��, who before and during the second world war had broad powers to investigate political groups seen as a threat to public order.A Kyodo news agency survey last month showed voters are split over the bill, with support at 39.9% and opposition at 41.4%.
An estimated 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the parliament building, denouncing the new law as �쏿utocratic�� and vowing to prevent Japan from turning into a �쐓urveillance society��.
�쏱eaceful demonstrations could be prohibited for being viewed as terrorism,�� Miyuki Masuyama, a 54-year-old woman, told Kyodo news. �쏰ur freedom of expression will be threatened.��
Three teenage women have been arrested in connection with Thursday�셲 counter-terrorism raid in north London, in which another woman was shot and injured.
Two 18-year-olds and a 19-year-old were arrested on Monday morning in east London on suspicion of planning terror attacks, the Metropolitan police said. They are being held at a police station outside London.
The arrests were part of an �쐎ngoing intelligence-led operation��, police said.
Ten people have now been arrested under the Terrorism Act since Thursday evening, when armed police swooped on a terrace house on Harlesden Road, Willesden, shooting and injuring the 21-year-old woman and firing CS gas canisters.
That raid was carried out by elite counter-terrorism specialist firearms officers (CTSFO) and is believed to have been the first time the unit has opened fire during an operation. Dramatic footage filmed by witnesses showed armed officers in black pointing weapons at the upstairs window of the property.
The injured woman was arrested on Sunday immediately after being released from hospital, where she had spent two days recovering under police guard.
Witnesses said the injured woman, who was wearing a long dress and hijab, shouted at paramedics not to touch her body as she was treated at the scene. Although some media reports suggested the woman was pregnant, it is understood she is not.
Four people, one of whom was a 16-year-old boy, were arrested, including two people who returned to the house in the early hours of Friday morning. A man aged 21 was arrested nearby and a 43-year-old woman was arrested in Kent.
Speaking on Friday, deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu said the raids were in response to an active plot, adding that police had �쐁ontained the threats��.
On Saturday Westminster magistrates court extended the detention of those arrested to dates between 2 and 4 May.
One of those arrested is believed to be Mohamed Amoudi, 21, a British citizen of Yemeni origin who was deported from Turkey in 2015 and questioned on his return to the UK but released without any further action.
The former Queen Mary University student was arrested in Turkey in 2015 on suspicion of planning to cross the border into Syria alongside two 17-year-old schoolboys, the Times reported at the time. The three were arrested again on their return to the UK but released without charge.
Scotland Yard said the Willesden house had been �쐕nder observation by counter-terrorism officers as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation��, adding that the incident was not connected to the suspected attempted terrorist attack in Westminster earlier on Thursday.
Greater Manchester police have admitted that use of the phrase �쏛llahu Akbar�� was a planned part of a terror training exercise at one of the UK�셲 biggest shopping centres.
Police were criticised for explicitly linking the drill at the Trafford Centre in Manchester to Islam when a fake suicide bomber shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� before appearing to detonate a device. The phrase translates as �쏥od is greatest�� and is used in prayer by Muslims.
On Tuesday Asst Ch Con Garry Shewan apologised for the use of the phrase. On Wednesday police said they had always planned to use the phrase in the operation, which took five months to organise, and that it was not introduced by the individual playing the part of the terrorist.
More than 800 volunteers took part in the training exercise on Monday night, which was designed to be similar to the Paris and Brussels atrocities.
Shewan said on Tuesday: �쏤or the past 24 hours, GMP, along with other agencies, has been hosting a counter-terrorism training exercise based at the Trafford Centre, which began with a mock suicide bomber detonating a bomb inside the shopping centre.
�쏧t is a necessity for agencies, including the police, to train and prepare using exercises such as this, so that we would be in the best possible position to respond in the event that the unthinkable happened and an attack took place.��
He went on: �쏷he scenario for this exercise is based on a suicide attack by an extremist Daesh-style organisation and the scenario writers have centred the circumstances around previous similar attacks of this nature, mirroring details of past events to make the situation as real life as possible for all of those involved.
�쏦owever, on reflection, we acknowledge that it was unacceptable to use this religious phrase immediately before the mock suicide bombing, which so vocally linked this exercise with Islam. We recognise and apologise for the offence that this has caused.��
One of the people who complained, Siema Iqbal, a Manchester GP, tweeted to Greater Manchester police demanding an explanation for why the terrorist in the training exercise had to be Muslim.
Erinma Bell, another doctor, retweeted Iqbal, adding: �쏥ood question. We need to move away from stereotypes if we want to achieve real learning. A terrorist can be anyone.��
The Community Safety Forum, an anti-Islamophobia organisation, said: �쏷his sort of thing panders to stereotypes and further divides us. It will increase anti-Muslim hate crime.��
Tony Lloyd, the mayor of Greater Manchester and the area�셲 police and crime commissioner, said the simulated terror attack had been �쏿 very good exercise in preparing for a situation we never want to see but must be ready for��.
But he said it was frustrating that the operation had been �쐌arred by the ill-judged, unnecessary and unacceptable decision by organisers�� to have those playing the parts of terrorists shout the Islamic phrase. �쏧t didn�셳 add anything to the event, but has the potential to undermine the great community relations we have in Greater Manchester,�� he said.
The apology from Greater Manchester police provoked a backlash by some who saw it as overly politically correct. An editorial in the Sun newspaper described it as �쏿 gutless surrender to political correctness��.
It said: �쏞ops have been cowed by dim, dangerous idiots unable to admit the simple reality that Britain�셲 main security threat is from Islamist murderers. The staged assault was meant to be by �쁝 Daesh-style organisation��, another term for IS. Rightly so. Who else but IS and al-Qaeda pose us such a threat? In whose name do they claim to kill but Allah�셲?��
The drill �� the latest in a series of similar exercises across the country �� started at midnight in the food court when a man dressed in black walked in and shouted at the crowd. An explosion was heard and a masked gunman fired shots at volunteers, who were wearing ear defenders and safety glasses. Fake shoppers covered in fake blood screamed out as if they were in pain.
Neither the emergency services nor volunteers taking part knew the precise details of the scenario, called Exercise Winchester Accord. The drill lasted for six hours.
The shopping centre was open as usual on Tuesday, although the exercise was due to continue unseen and at unspecified locations until Wednesday, when it will finish in Merseyside.
It was Monday morning and Australia was winding down for Christmas.
There was a smattering of news around: some terrorism raids in north-west Sydney, the release of a business case for Victoria�셲 proposed East-West Link toll road and from Canberra, the release of treasurer Joe Hockey�셲 mid-year financial report.
Otherwise, Monday was a typical summer day �� hazy, warm and soporific, made for skipping off work early, lazy lunches, Christmas shopping or drinks with friends.
Then, at 9.44am, it all changed. A man who had been a customer in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, at the heart of the city�셲 business district, held a gun to the head of a worker. It was the beginning of a 16-hour siege, the aftershocks of which will be felt in Australia for some time to come.
The first anybody in the Lindt cafe knew something was wrong was when the manager of shop, Tori Johnson, had a gun pointed at him by customer Man Haron Monis.
Previously, Monis, 50, had been seated, talking with Johnson, the Monday-morning hubbub of the cafe all around them.
An 83-year-old former Wimbledon tennis player, John O�섳rien, was in the cafe after his annual visit to the eye doctor. At another table were Louisa Hope, 50, and her mother Robyn, 70. Both live outside Sydney, but were enjoying an overnight stay in the city and had come to the cafe as a Christmas treat.
Also in the cafe were two Indian-born software engineers �� Pushpendu Ghosh and Viswakanth Ankireddy, who were working on a project for nearby bank Westpac. Marcia Mikhael and Selina Win Pe, two more Westpac employees, were also customers.
Behind the counter were workers Joel Herat, Jarrod Hoffman, Harriette Denny, Fiona Ma, Elly Chen, Bae Jieun and supervisor Paolo Vassallo.
Scant attention was paid to Monis, who sat with a bag at his feet.
Then, almost without warning, Monis was standing.
He drew a gun �� which, although not confirmed by police, has been reported as either a short barrelled or sawn-off shotgun �� and bellowed at customers to stand with their hands up.
He screamed at them that he was a representative of Islamic State and that this was a terrorist attack.
He told them there were bombs in the building, and that they must do as he instructed. Monis locked the doors of the cafe and forced his hostages to stand still, their hands high in the air.
When a woman outside came to the automatic doors, banging on them to be let in, Monis waved the gun in her direction, a silent warning that no one was to come in �� or out.
The woman alerted police, who quickly surrounded the building. Martin Place, busy for a year-end Monday morning, was hastily evacuated.
News of an unusual situation, possibly an armed hold-up, was first broadcast to the wider world by a tweet from The Australian�셲 Chris Kenny at 9.52am. It said: �쏶cary situation Martin place �� cops clearing area �� woman says man may have shotgun.��
Guardian reporters checked the information with NSW police, who replied a �쐏olice operation was ongoing��.
Kenny added more detail, saying there were hostages with their arms against the window in the Lindt coffee shop. He had gone in for a takeaway coffee and narrowly missed being caught in the drama.
On the television, Channel 7 �� whose headquarters are across the road from the cafe �� were running a feed with commentary of the incident.
Morning Show hosts Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies were on the air as armed police began to gather in the background of their shot.
Guardian reporter Oliver Milman jumped in a cab from nearby Surry Hills to the scene in the CBD. Almost immediately, his taxi was nearly hit by an unmarked police car, its balaclava-wearing occupants agitated to get to the scene, forcing its way through the traffic.
Martin Place station was being evacuated and a police cordon was placed around the cafe.
Milman saw a female hostage pressed against the third window down from the door. Black-clad police were huddled against the wall, a position they�셝 keep for the next 15 hours or so.
Office buildings and shops were evacuated and onlookers gathered. Channel 7�셲 studios were evacuated. Journalist Mieke Buchan, a guest on The Morning Show, had been in the makeup room when she was evacuated. �쏧t looked like some sharp shooters went into the side door, and then police in protective gear basically came rushing in,�� she said.
Many evacuated office workers thought it was a bomb scare. Westpac, which had staff members trapped in the cafe, closed all 12 of its CBD branches.
Jorge Bonora stood alone on the Macquarie Street corner of Martin Place, as close as he could to the cafe where his fiancee, Harriette Denny, was.
Police came and went, asking Bonora for information about the layout of the cafe as he had worked on the renovations a while back. Bonora had the phone number for the cafe�셲 architect but no one had come to get it from him yet. In the meantime he fielded dozens of texts and calls from worried family and friends.
Lindt cafe worker Nathan Grivas was also at the scene. He arrived for his shift, tried the doors �� which were locked �� and then caught sight of the gunman and his terrified colleagues through the glass.
�쏷he doors were already shut, it all looked pretty dodgy. As soon as someone said gun, we got out. We called the cops and about a minute later all these guys on motorcycles arrived, so you realise it�셲 pretty serious,�� he told the Guardian. �쏧 was there for a bit because I had called the police and they wanted me to tell them the layout. I couldn�셳 be too much help because I only started on Friday. While I was there I saw a few of [my colleagues] up against the window with their hands up, I think one of them looked at me. He looked shocked. Lucky I didn�셳 start at nine.��
Meanwhile, the family of barrister Katrina Dawson were frantically trying to contact her via text. They had heard about the siege and were afraid she might be inside.
Dawson, who worked at nearby Eight Selbourne chambers, went to the cafe most days to buy hot chocolate.
On Monday she was accompanied by fellow barrister Julie Taylor. Stefan Balafoutis, another colleague, was also in the cafe.
As crowds and police gathered, suddenly the captive Lindt workers appeared at the windows holding up a flag.
The black flag with white writing hung in the window was initially mistaken by many for an Isis flag.
The pictures were broadcast instantaneously due to Channel 7�셲 live feed. This had turned from a siege at gunpoint to a possible terrorist attack. Rumours started to fly.
It turned out the flag was not an Isis flag. From the sliver of writing that could be made out in the early footage, it was identified correctly by some to be the Shahada �� the Islamic creed �쏷here is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God�� �� rendered in calligraphic Arabic. The message appears on the flag of Saudi Arabia, the al-Qaida linked group Jabhat al-Nusra, and the radical group Hizb ut-Tahrir.
Meanwhile, Muslim community leaders were talking. It had been a busy morning. At around 9am, a number of them had received phone calls from the counter-terror unit of the New South Wales police. They were called to a briefing in Bankstown, to be held an hour later, about an arrest earlier that morning of a suspect in an unrelated terror financing case. The meeting ended early as police learned of the Martin Place incident.
Ahmed Kilani, publisher of the website Muslim Village, was one of about 10 community representatives in the meeting room who remained behind, following the siege on TV.
He recalled the moment the unmistakable shahada flag flashed on screen. �쏧t was shock. Horror. Oh my goodness. This is our biggest nightmare coming to life,�� he told the Guardian.
�쏛nd then it was about, well, who is this guy? So we�셱e ringing around asking, �쁗ho is it?��, and people keep saying: �쁈 don�셳 know��.��
About an hour into the siege, hostage Harriette Denny, a barista at the cafe, rang her fiance Jorge Bonora. She told him that she loved him but couldn�셳 speak and then she hung up.
Bonora thought she must have managed to call him from upstairs where staff lockers were kept, and that she sounded scared.
Police were called over to where Bonora was standing. They suggested Bonora text Denny back. She replied later, saying much the same thing: she loved him and couldn�셳 wait to see him. She would text at least once more but gave no information about the ordeal.
�쏶he�셲 the sweetest person ever,�� Bonora told the Guardian. �쏶he took some of my old shoes and made me wash them and she gave them to a homeless guy. She just cares about everyone.��
A torrent of rumours swirled in those first heady hours. A bomb had been defused at Sydney Opera House. Two more had been planted in the city. Two more still were being toted by the gunman inside the cafe.
There was speculation that a police chase through city streets was a second gunman. It was unrelated to the siege, police said.
Sydney radio host Ray Hadley reported that there were terror raids in Lakemba, a suburb with a large Muslim population.
Citing Hadley, the rumours spread across social media. But the truth turned out to be more prosaic �� it was a pre-arranged police tour of a mosque. There were no raids.
And how many hostages were inside the cafe? It seemed no one knew. Estimates ranged from eight to 50, with dozens of figures in between.
In the panic, buildings were evacuated or closed, even some thousands of kilometres from the siege, including the Victorian parliament building and Lindt shops in other cities.
Screenshots from flight tracking websites flooded Twitter, showing masses of aircraft allegedly diverting from Sydney airport, claiming airspace above the city had been shut down. Mobile phone reception in the CBD would soon follow, some said on Twitter. These rumours worked their way into online mainstream media coverage and in those feverish early hours were reported in some places as fact.
Throughout the day, Monis forced his hostages to call media outlets around the country and act as his spokesperson.
They called newsrooms at radio station 2GB, TV stations Nine, Seven and Ten as well as News Corp Australia and the ABC, relaying Monis�셲 demands. Those on the receiving end of the calls reported hearing the gunman barking orders in the background. But all media had been requested by police not to go to air.
Channel Ten reported his demands, as well as the claim there were bombs in the city. Journalist Hugh Rimington said afterwards that police had not specifically asked them not to air the messages.
2GB�셲 radio presenter Ray Hadley took the call off air, but let listeners know that the hostages had been in touch. 2GB said the phone call had been verified by NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione, but asked about it at a press conference shortly afterwards Scipione would not confirm or deny it.
So what did Monis want? In exchange for an on-air live broadcast phone call with Tony Abbott, Monis was prepared to release five hostages.
In exchange for a public declaration from the government that his was an act of terror committed on behalf of Islamic State, he was prepared to release two more.
And for a black Isis flag he was prepared to release a final prisoner.
As the standoff dragged into the afternoon, Monis began to realise his message was not being heard.
Monis was spreading terror and fear amongst his captives. Some screamed, while others burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably. At least one hostage began to vomit in fear.
Monis became furious once he realised his messages were not being broadcast by media outlets.
�쏻e�셱e not getting out of here,�� one hostage said to another, �쐍one of us are. We are going to die here.��
When a hostage�셲 phone rang and was answered, Monis screamed: �쏡rop that phone!��
Monis was the only person holding a weapon in the cafe. But he realised he could not, alone, keep control of so many hostages.
�쏷he gunman was surrounding himself with the staff from Lindt,�� the Guardian was told by a hostage, �쐄orcing them to stand near him, he was using them to control the social media, to get his message out. He was directing them on what to do, who to call, what to say.
�쏷he other people, the older people, he pushed to the other side of the shop, he kept them there.��
The gunman was refusing to engage with police negotiators. Hours passed without a clue about his identity. According to sources, at around 1.30pm officers invited senior Muslim leaders to a south-west Sydney police station and distributed photographs of the assailant. Did anyone recognise him?
�쏧t could be Sheikh Haron,�� one finally said, referring to a notorious self-styled peace activist.
Police scrambled to compare the photographs to police videos from the previous day, when Haron, or Man Haron Monis, had checked in with police in line with his bail conditions. The pictures matched.
Superintendent John Reilly, commander of the NSW counter-terrorism special operations group, told the Guardian that around the same time, across the city, a number of Muslim and police sources were also coming to the conclusion that Monis was the gunman.
Nearby, Ahmed Kilani�셲 phone was ringing. �쏷his is going to sound really weird and strange,�� the officer on the other end of the line said. �쏝ut I want you to try to get me an Isis flag.��
Kilani said he was struck by the request, but not offended. �쏰ur relationship is so good with these guys, we discuss everything openly. So there was no embarrassment, nothing.��
Still, he had never actually seen an Isis flag in Australia. �쏮aybe we could make one up for you?�� he asked.
Reilly says the request for the Isis flag came �쐄airly early�� in the siege.
�쏪ust to have one on tap, we contacted community leaders. So they�셱e ringing around trying to find one for us,�� he said. �쏛nd eventually we were able to get one.��
Reilly said the flag was provided in �쐅ood faith�� that there would be no repercussions. �쏻e haven�셳 gone looking for the source of it. If we�셱e asking for something, we�셱e not going to persecute [the owner].��
In the afternoon, a coordinated area for families of the hostages was set up near St James�셲 station.
But even inside the dedicated support and information centre, relatives received news the same way the rest of the country did, watching or reading the news. Some would wander out to the street for a cigarette or fresh air.
The family of barrister Katrina Dawson decided not to say anything to her three young children, hoping that she would emerge from the ordeal unscathed.
For the first hour Bruce Herat, father of hostage Joel, was kept at police barricades without information.
�쏛bout two and a half hours later we were told that a special room was being set up [for the families] in the old criminal courthouse,�� Herat told Fairfax Media.
�쏻e were given very neutral information first at around 2pm on Monday. Looking back it was frustrating �� but they wanted to be able to deliver information efficiently, when all the families were gathered round, rather than having to repeat it a dozen times when each of the families arrived, so I can see the logic of it.��
In the cafe, the tension was horrific.
�쏷here was no reasoning with him, he was so angry,�� one hostage told the Guardian. �쏦e knew his message was not getting out, and he was getting angrier and angrier.��
There were moments, however, of calm and of conciliation. Hostages were allowed to take drinks of water, and one woman who had medication was given permission to take it.
When his captives asked to go to the toilet, Monis deputised a member of the cafe staff �� themselves hostages �� to escort them, and bring them back to the shop.
But as the afternoon dragged on, Monis, grew more erratic and unpredictable. Hostages began to plead with their captor. Some begged to be released, pleading to see their families. Monis refused.
Hostages Stefan Balafoutis and John O�섳rien asked to go to the toilet, and, being escorted past the glass doors, asked the staff member pressed into being their sentry whether the green button at the base of the door would open it.
The staff member did not know. �쏧�셶e only worked here for about a week.��
It was 3.37pm, and the siege had run nearly six hours. The men decided to take their chances.
As Monis was focused on speaking to the people nearest to him, they ran for the front door, and pushed at the button.
The doors slid open, and they sprinted to safety.
Then a third, Lindt supervisor Paolo Vassallo, escaped through a fire door nearby.
The police were armed and in position �� as they had been since the siege begun around seven hours earlier.
Abruptly, two Lindt employees, Elly Chen and Bae Jieun 20, ran out of the cafe within seconds of each other. Bae Jieun was the first to escape. Distress etched on her face, she ran into the arms of a police officer. Elly followed seconds later.
Photographers were there to catch images which went around the globe �� they went on to become the faces of the Sydney siege.
The crowd had grown to about 400 but spectators had become more sedate. Nadia El-Mouelhy, who watched from the gutter, said she felt compelled to come to Martin Place to see if she could help. �쏧 feel so sorry for the people inside. This isn�셳 Islam, it�셲 stupid.��
Channel 7 journalist Chris Reason had been allowed back into the evacuated Martin Place newsroom. He and a cameraman were positioned next a police sniper, looking directly into the cafe. He said the hostages were being rotated near the window and food had been delivered to them.
Meanwhile on social media the hashtag #illridewithyou was gaining momentum both in Australia and overseas. Earlier in the day Michael James had tweeted a screenshot from the Facebook profile of a woman named Rachel Jacobs, who said she had seen a Muslim woman in Brisbane take off her hijab after news of the siege broke. At 4.28pm, Twitter user Tessa Kum built on Jacobs�셲 actions, offering to travel with any Muslims who felt unsafe wearing religious attire.�� A minute later, she tweeted: �쏮aybe start a hashtag? What�셲 in #illridewithyou?��
By 6pm it had been mentioned 90,000 times and was trending worldwide, with countless news outlets mentioning it as a bright spark of hope in a tragic day.
When it got dark Monis started handing out food to hostages but realised the cafe lights made him visible to those watching outside. He asked a woman to turn them off. Mike Bowers, a Guardian photographer stationed nearby, caught an image of a cafe worker in an apron turning off the light. All went dark.
�쏬ater on a dim light came on and you could see silhouettes,�� Bowers said.
It started getting cold, the winds racing through the empty canyons of Martin Place. As time passed the crowds dispersed, but the police remained in position.
Just after midnight, the first video from inside the Lindt cafe was uploaded to the internet. The clip, which looked as though it had been shot from a phone, featured a woman in front of the same Islamic flag that had been displayed from the window hours earlier.
Soon four videos had been uploaded. The speakers, all women, warned of bombs in the city that would be �쐇gnited�� if the hostage taker�셲 demands were not met.
�쏻e do not understand why these demands haven�셳 been met yet, they are not unreasonable. He is only asking for a flag and a phone call,�� one hostage said. She called the man �쐎ur brother��.
Hostage Joel Herat was forced to upload the videos through his Facebook and YouTube account.
Herat�셲 father told Fairfax: �쏧 felt somewhat cold when I saw those, thinking if [the gunman] is going to that resort, then obviously he is starting to target people as emotional conduits to get what he wanted. My concern then was how far would he go.��
Around 2am Monis became agitated and started moving hostages around in two groups. As Monis moved one group, the other group of seven made a dash for the door.
Bruce Herat said his son�셲 group of hostages decided to kick down an internal door and escape.
�쏤rom what Joel told me initially, towards 2am Monis started to bring groups of people together in close proximity from where they had been dispersed throughout [the cafe]��, Herat told Fairfax Media.
�쏛nd at that point in time, Joel and five others came to the conclusion that they were not going to survive until the morning if they did not do something. So I think him and Jarrod [Hoffman, another hostage] basically came to the conclusion that they would bust down the door. And I know that Joel made sure that Harriette [Denny] ... got behind him and he said, �쁚ou�셱e coming with me��, and basically made sure that all that group were ready to go when Joel and Jarrod broke down the door.��
The group was seen fleeing the building just minutes before heavily armed police stormed the cafe with flash grenades and live ammunition.
The gunfight was over in about 30 seconds, and from the cafe police and emergency officers emerged carrying injured hostages. Three were on stretchers and a fourth hostage was carried in the arms of two officers.
Louisa Hope, who had reportedly been used as a human shield by Monis when police entered, had been shot in the foot. Her mother was shot in her shoulder. Another woman was shot in the leg, while a police officer received a minor facial injury from a gun pellet.
Ambulance officers worked frantically, administering CPR on the sidewalk to barrister Katrina Dawson, a mother of three who had been shot. She was pronounced dead at hospital.
Tori Johnson, the cafe manager, was also killed during the siege, reportedly shot in the head by Monis.
Monis was the third person killed during the siege.
After six terrorist assaults on civilians in less than a fortnight, France and Germany are reeling from a series of shocks that, beyond the immediate fears and tensions they have sown, will increasingly test Europe�셲 liberal democratic order. Both countries are experiencing an unprecedented wave of violent acts just as they gear up for key elections next year. An already volatile, angst-ridden situation is amplified by a political context of rising populism and partisan point-scoring.
As France struggles to cope with the aftermath of the killing of Father Jacques Hamel in his church near Rouen, barely 24 hours after Germany had experienced its fourth assault in a single week, the sentiment is growing that life as people have known it is unravelling; and that the new normal may resemble a mixture of unpredictable, hidden dangers and a rush to large-scale security measures. In France, where attacks began in 2012, talk of �쐗ar�� with jihadi terrorism has become commonplace. There is a nationwide state of emergency. Germany neither talks of war, nor is there a state of emergency. But혻after Ansbach, the first Islamic State-claimed suicide bombing in Germany, the interior minister, Thomas de Maizi챔re, acknowledged that Germany too had become a target for international terrorism.
In the immediate aftermath of each attack, the question is always why it was not foiled. In France, security flaws are blamed. In혻Germany, the argument is about monitoring refugees. The questions swirl regardless of whether or not there is a connection with last year�셲 massive refugee movement into Europe, or with radical Islam.
In both France and Germany in the aftermath of attacks, political passions quickly flared; but it is France�셲 political cohesion that혻appears under the greater strain. France�셲 show of national unity after the 2015 attacks in Paris swiftly fell apart in the aftermath of the Nice attack. Fran챌ois Hollande is now struggling to defend his credibility and resist growing demands for heightened security measures. Some of his rightwing critics even call for a �쏤rench Guant찼namo��. Marine Le Pen�셲 far right Front National seized on Tuesday�셲 attack to say France�셲 �쏞hristian roots�� are in peril. Anti-immigrant hyperbole is rife. In Germany, political reactions are comparatively more subdued: Chancellor Angela Merkel�셲 popularity and authority remain strong. Her CSU Bavarian coalition partner wants stringent controls on migrants but, perhaps because its electoral prospects still hinge on the alliance with the chancellor�셲 CSU in the run-up to next year�셲 general election, it has avoided direct personal attacks on her. Germany�셲 far right has grown but it is still dwarfed by the French Front National. The anti-immigrant AfD party has prospered on a narrative of rejecting Muslims, but stumbled when it hastily and erroneously described the Munich attack as an act of jihadi fundamentalism.
Germany�셲 sense of its own history is a strong antidote against some of the more extremist tendencies currently at play in France. Where France�셲 political leadership has spoken more about the need to come out �쐖ictorious�� from a �쐗ar�� than about the tolerance and efforts needed to make diversity an asset rather than a problem, German officials have gone to great lengths to insist that terrorism should not be conflated with refugees or immigrants. Personal styles differ too: whereas Mr Hollande wants to appear combative and resolute against the �쐃nemy��, Mrs Merkel expresses empathy for the victims rather than a penchant for military-type measures.
Whatever the contrasts, in heated political contexts ahead of each nation�셲 2017 elections, the decisions and attitudes these leaders endorse will set an example for the whole of Europe. Two countries that already set the tone on many issues across a continent now scarred by hostility to refugees hover on the edge of deep, newly shared, uncertainties.
October 2002
Over a period of three weeks, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed 10 people and critically injured three others in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Virginia. The pair were also suspected of earlier shootings in Maryland, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, and Washington state. While their motives remain a mystery, evidence presented at the trial showed Muhammad and Malvo were in possession of images related to jihad.
March 2006
Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar injured six people when he drove an SUV into a group of pedestrians at UNC-Chapel Hill �쐔o avenge the deaths or murders of Muslims around the world��. He turned himself into police shortly after the attack. He pleaded guilty to nine counts of attempted first degree murder, and in 2008 was sentenced to 33 years in prison.
June 2009
Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and killed one soldier and injured another in a drive-by shooting at a military careers station in Little Rock, Arkansas. Muhammad, a convert to Islam, had visited Yemen for 16 months where he spent time in prison and became radicalised. He said he was part of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and was upset over the US killing Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2011 he pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
November 2009
Maj Nidal Malik Hasan of the US army opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 people and wounding at least 30. In 2013, Hasan was convicted by a military tribunal. He defended himself and took responsibility for the attack saying his motive was jihad, to fight �쐇llegal and immoral aggression against Muslims��. The US government has not called the shooting a terrorist attack, characterising it as one of �쐗orkplace violence��. Hasan was sentenced to death.
April 2013
Chechen brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev detonated two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. After the bombing, they shot and killed an MIT campus police officer while he was sitting in his squad car, before hijacking an SUV and fleeing to nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. A huge police chase ensued, resulting in a shootout during which several IED�셲 were thrown by the brothers.
Tamerlan was shot and killed at the scene. The younger Dzhokhar was later discovered inside a boat parked in a driveway less than three blocks away. He was taken into custody after another exchange of gunfire and arraigned on federal terrorism charges. A note written by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, on the boat where he was captured, said the bombings were in retaliation for US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan against Muslims. In 2015 he was found guilty on all 30 counts related to the bombing and shootout with police, and sentenced to death.
October 2014
Zale Thompson injured two NYPD Officers with an 18in hatchet on a crowded sidewalk in Queens. Four officers were posing for a photograph when Thompson charged them. They opened fire killing Thompson and injuring a civilian. Thompson, who converted to Islam two years before the attack, was a frequent visitor of websites that promoted jihad, but police said he had no ties to any international terror group.
May 2015
Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi opened fire outside a Muhammad art exhibit event at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas. The event featured the first inaugural �쐂raw the prophet�� contest. A Garland school district police officer was injured. Both gunmen were killed by police. Isis later claimed responsibility for the attack.
July 2015
Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Four Marines and one sailor were killed and a police officer was injured. Abdulazeez was killed by police in a gunfight following a high-speed chase. He was a naturalised US citizen born in Kuwait. The FBI has yet to determine whether it was an act of terrorism.
December 2015
Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 17 others. Farook had been at the centre for a Christmas party earlier but left following an argument. The pair fled in an SUV but were later killed by police. Bomb equipment, weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition were found in their home. The FBI said it was investigating the shootings as �쐆orrific acts of terrorism�� after it emerged the couple had apparent links to Isis.
Terror and Consent: The Wars for the Twenty-first Century
 by Philip Bobbitt
 688pp, Allen Lane, 짙25
George Bush's claim that we are involved in a war against terror has been widely ridiculed. At best, it was a politician's rhetorical flourish like the war against poverty or the war against drugs; at worst, it was a cynical device to justify interventionist wars overseas and encroachments on civil liberties at home.
Philip Bobbitt devotes more than 600 pages to arguing that the concept of a war against terror is historically, legally, politically and morally correct. His style is academically merciless: he starts by demolishing, in turn, 22 popular fallacies perpetrated by those who do not believe we are at war. But this is an important book by an influential American strategic thinker and must be taken seriously. His defence of the most famous Bushism contrasts with his evident contempt for the Bush administration itself (over Guant찼namo, torture, the conduct of the Iraq war, support for the Israeli incursion into Lebanon, the treatment of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and much else), and his views bear a striking similarity to those of the man who may well be the next US president, John McCain.
His central argument is that the war against terror (starting with the one against al-Qaida) is fundamentally different in character from earlier manifestations of terrorism: from the Jewish rebels against the Romans, Indian thuggees, and pirates of the Caribbean through to the Jacobins, the IRA and the PLO. The differences are two. One is that the new terrorism centres on the acquisition and eventual, deliberate, use of weapons of mass destruction to generate mass terror; 9/11 was, on this view, merely an hors d'oeuvre for a bigger meal to come. He reproduces detailed evidence and extrapolates from known facts to argue that the proliferation of WMD technology through the commercial networks of Pakistan's nuclear pioneer AQ Khan and others, and the systematic acquisition of this technology by al-Qaida, is much more of a threat than we like to believe. When we are being simultaneously warned about the horrors of climate change, water wars, energy wars, and other roads to Armageddon, the war against terror struggles to retain priority status, but Bobbitt makes a good case for it.
His second big idea is that modern terrorist organisations are a natural response to the end of the era of the nation state. The new terrorist groups, such as al-Qaida, mimic and are a product of the decentralised, outsourcing, privatised, globalised, networked world of what he calls the new market state. Market states are wealthier and offer more opportunities than traditional nation states. But they are more vulnerable, and part of their vulnerability lies in the "commodification" of and trade in weapons of mass destruction. The new terrorist groups know their enemy. They have no interest in national identity or territory; they have a "global" ideology; and their aim is to disable the market state by causing mass death and creating terror among civilian populations.
Bobbitt's policy prescriptions are ambitious, spanning a new approach to strategy, international relations and the rule of law. He argues for "preclusion", which is in part a posh new academic word for a pre-emptive strike. But preclusion goes way beyond armed intervention. He supported the Iraq war, but was scathing about its narrow, militarist execution and the failure to move quickly to protect civilians from a breakdown in law and order or to achieve early reconstruction. He wants to see intervention "by states of consent" to protect civilians from genocide in "states of terror" (he wanted the US to take a lead in Rwanda and Darfur) and also from the consequences of natural disasters, including climate change. There is much in his approach that a muscular "liberal interventionist" - such as Tony Blair or Paddy Ashdown - could feel at ease with. But he applies the same approach domestically, too. He writes scathingly about the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina; such demonstrations of anarchy, inhumanity and incompetence merely fortify the enemies of free societies and represent a defeat in the war on terror. Even those who share his prejudices about the Bush administration might feel, however, that this is taking the concept of the war on terror rather far.
He would go further: demilitarising the military, equipping it with skills for policing, reconstruction and non-lethal management of protest (including such wacky ideas as using large numbers of rubber balls for crowd control). Since the objective of the war on terror is to prevent civilian mass terror, there can be, almost by definition, no definitive victory or success beyond the continued demonstration of stability and security. No less important is an uncompromising defence of the rule of law, which is the bedrock of the "market state". For this reason, Guant찼namo, Abu Ghraib and illegal torture are treated as massively damaging own goals. He also insists that failure to treat the war on terror as a war has unintended damaging consequences. The victims of 9/11, for example, were compensated on the basis of tort: rich stockbrokers were paid much more than poor janitors, since their lost income stream was greater. A country at war would recognise the equality of sacrifice. In this argument he finds himself at odds with serious military historians, such as Sir Michael Howard, who worry that escalating al-Qaida terrorism from criminality to warfare risks confusing means and ends. Bobbitt's answer is that terrorism - on a wholly new scale - is both means and end.
The war on terror was a concept first proclaimed by a president who will be remembered for incompetence and intellectual laziness. We shouldn't assume, however, that it will disappear with him. Better presidents, Republican and Democrat, may well adopt it. If so, this book is the place to discover what the war on terror actually means.

My best friend died the other day. He and 21 other concert-goers were killed in the Manchester Arena by an individual to whom no attention should be paid. We cherish the memory of the victims and we mourn with their families.
Megan Hurley, Courtney Boyle, Philip Tron, Wendy Fawell, Elaine McIver, Eilidh MacLeod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Nell Jones, Michelle Kiss, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Kelly Brewster, Olivia Campbell, John Atkinson, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Saffie Rose Roussos, Georgina Callander and my dear friend Martyn Hett. Equally, we will remember the victims whose lives were taken callously on London Bridge and in Borough Market.
One person who offered condolences to the Manchester victims was King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and head of the autocratic Saud family that has ruled Saudi Arabia since the foundation of the modern state in 1932. He picked up the phone to his staunch ally Theresa May and, like many of the world�셲 leaders, condemned the attack and said he was committed to standing shoulder to shoulder with Britain in the war on terror.
There is no reason to believe his words were insincere. Saudi Arabia has, after all, fallen victim to terrorism countless times on its own soil. Yet, there is a story that�셲 not being told, touched upon briefly by Caroline Lucas in Wednesday�셲 televised general election debate. As Lucas underlined, the UK is the world�셲 second biggest arms dealer, and delivers its bombs and guns to 22 of the 30 countries on our government�셲 own human rights watch list.
It should come as no surprise that Saudi Arabia is high on that list with its repressive male guardianship system; its provisions for the imprisonment and execution of LGBT people; and its complete disregard for the freedoms of expression, association and belief. That�셲 before you even consider the Saudi-led bombing raids on Yemen, which the UN confirms have been the single biggest cause of the thousands of lives lost in the bloody conflict in the Arab world�셲 poorest country.The list of Saudi atrocities is long and the victims are too numerous to name. So why is it that British firms have sold 짙3bn worth of weapons to the Saudis in the past three years alone, while the British government continues to send an annual aid package to Yemen amounting to a fraction of that revenue? Our government�셲 support for the Al Saud family makes us complicit in mass murder. Sadly, in Wednesday�셲 debate, Theresa May was too busy to turn up and defend her government�셲 appalling record. When confronted about the issue, her foot soldier, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, merely shrugged: �쏧t�셲 good for industry.��
So what does all this have to do with the callous murder of 22 people in Manchester last week? Well, it requires us to look into the ideology that drove that sorry man to commit such an act. The Saudi-sponsored brand of Islam known as Wahhabism is widely considered to be the source of much extremist thought. In the words of the world�셲 largest Muslim youth organisation, it is characterised by antipathy �� at times violent �� towards Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and even other Sunni Muslims who do not share the Wahhabis�� rigid and authoritarian view of Islam.
�쏤or more than fifty years, Saudi Arabia has systematically propagated a supremacist, ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam among Sunni Muslim populations worldwide,�� read the official statement released by the Indonesian Muslim youth movement Gerakan Pemuda Ansor ,the day after my friend was killed. �쏷he Wahhabi/ultra-conservative view of Islam �� which is embraced not only by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but also by al-Qaida and Isis �� is intricately wedded to those elements of classical Islamic law that foster sectarian hatred and violence.��
I do not blame May or her government for the death of my friend, nor do I hold anyone responsible for the depraved act other than the perpetrator himself, but we must look at these things in context. To shrug off complicity in the killing of thousands of innocents for the sake of industry is, to my mind, criminal. To turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia�셲 aggressive propagation of an ultra-conservative version of Islam and its role in the radicalisation of young minds is equally incriminating.
While you might attack Jeremy Corbyn for his failure to recall a figure when pushed by Emma Barnett on Woman�셲 Hour, or for his policies, you cannot possibly fault him on the pledge to end the sale of arms to the kingdom after almost 60 years. On Thursday, it is with conviction that I will cast my vote for Labour, and for our best chance of a foreign policy to be proud of: one that does not just aim to cash in on arms deals regardless of the consequences, but one that makes trade deals conditional on the guarantee of universal human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
A week after the attack, I returned to my workplace and knew I had to leave my job. Enough. When I signed up to a consulting job in public diplomacy for the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs I was unaware of what I was taking on, but 18 long months of compromising my morals have taken their toll.The experience will haunt me: my complicity in extolling the virtues of Saudi Arabia�셲 baby steps towards gender equality, in extending Saudi commiserations over the deaths of young gay people in the Orlando bombing, in offering explanations for the bloody war in Yemen. The fact that it took the murder of my closest friend to take the leap into the dark is unfortunate, but in the few days since I have felt nothing but relief at the prospect of an unfettered future. Be more Martyn.
Theresa May has had a torrid political March on several fronts, but she has a valuable gift for calm and a knack of catching the public mood at moments like the aftermath of the attack on Wednesday afternoon in central London. In a statement to MPs today, Mrs May successfully combined dignity with emotion as she paid tribute to the police officer PC Keith Palmer, who was killed protecting parliament by the man later named as Khalid Masood. She maintained a proportionate and reasoned tone as she discussed the details of the emergency and the fast and courageous response to it. Masood�셲 hired 4x4, in its murderous career across Westminster Bridge, killed a tourist and a teacher and one other who has not yet been named. It injured up to 40 others.
Every MP who spoke in the Commons caught the prime minister�셲 mood. All were at pains to emphasise the need for solidarity. All took care to distinguish between the overwhelming majority of British Muslims and the handful of individuals inspired by Islamic State and similar groups who have been responsible for most of the recent terror attacks and plots in Europe (but not all: Jo Cox�셲 murderer was a white supremacist).
It was notable that the prime minister also resisted the temptation to reach for new legislation. There was no talk of extra powers for the security services. But in the wings is a plan, dating from her time as home secretary, for a strengthened version of the counter-terror Prevent strategy. Prevent was introduced four years ago in a bid to identify and tackle radicalism; more than 8,000 people have been referred for possible inclusion in the programme. But it is distrusted in Muslim communities and has been criticised by both the Commons home affairs committee and David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who fear it is regarded as a spying programme. They want it redirected towards community engagement.
Away from Westminster, there was an exception to the attempt to return to business as usual. In total disregard of their ignorance of the facts at the time, the Ukip leader Paul Nuttall and his predecessor, Nigel Farage, renewed their baseless and disgraceful campaign to drive a wedge between Muslims혻and non-Muslims in Britain.
Only hours after the attack, Mr Farage took혻to US television to bind the terror attack with immigration policy. He recycled an old Daily Mail story about Labour �쐓ending out search parties�� for migrant workers. He asserted that there was an undefined �쐄ifth column�� at work in Europe which was혻the result of uncontrolled immigration. He claimed the attack justified Donald Trump�셲 attempts to ban Muslims from some혻Middle혻Eastern countries.
What Mr Farage said was quite unconnected with reality. But he has added a little more alloy to the coin of political debate. His rush to blame multiculturalism contributes to an atmosphere where some feel licensed to express hatred �� witness the vicious social media spat over an apparently frightened young woman in a hijab looking the other way as she walked by one of the injured. Some of what he said has been picked up and given prominence in mainstream media.
The inconvenient truth for these cynics is that Masood was born and grew up here, and although he had convictions for violence as a young man it appears he was not considered a risk by the security services. Experts believe even Isis, which now claims him as a soldier of Islam, did not know the attack was coming. The best chance of detecting such threats is likely to be from sources within the Muslim community. That surely means promoting engagement, not surveillance.
NHS hospital trauma units have been put on standby to deal with a potential fresh terrorist attack, possibly happening as soon as this weekend. The NHS has told every hospital in England, including the 27 that are specialist trauma centres, to �쐏repare for a further incident��.
Surgical teams must be ready to treat people who have been caught up in a bomb blast or hit by shrapnel as part of the measures triggered by the nationwide alert status being raised to critical.It is the first time since the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 that NHS hospital trusts have been told to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale terrorist attack.The message to the 27 trauma centres has come from Chris Moran, a surgeon and professor, who is NHS England�셲 national clinical director for trauma.Moran said in the message: �쏷he trauma community in Manchester has provided a tremendous response to the atrocity on Monday night and this is a credit to their dedication and clinical skills, and also the preparation that has taken place.
�쏽ou will be aware that we have a bank holiday weekend approaching. There are a number of things that all trauma units and major trauma centres can do to prepare for a further incident and I should be grateful if you could disseminate these within your network so that frontline clinicians are aware.��
The Health Service Journal, which obtained Moran�셲 message, reported: �쏷he message advised surgical teams to prepare for the consequences of attacks by reviewing the early management of patients with blast and ballistic injuries, as well as advice on dealing with infections and use of antibiotics.�쒷HS England said that all NHS trusts should be taking precautionary measures in the wake of the Manchester bombing.
A spokesman said: �쏶ince the [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre] has announced the threat level has changed from severe to critical, this triggers longstanding, tried and tested NHS protocols reflected in this letter, which reminds NHS organisations of the precautionary measures they need to take ensure care is in place should it be needed.��
In a separate letter to trusts, Anne Rainsberry, NHS England�셲 national incident director, advised them to review their staffing levels and supplies of blood and equipment, as well as patients who could be discharged quickly to free up beds in case an incident occurred.
Meanwhile, some of the 75 people still in hospital after being injured in Monday�셲 bombing have �쐋ife-changing injuries��, and 23 remain in critical care, the NHS has confirmed. They include many lower limb injuries and wounds caused by the nuts and bolts which were added to the bomb.
�쏷he NHS and care organisations together with partners across the voluntary sector will be providing care and support for individuals in the weeks, months and years to come. Some individuals will now have life-changing injuries which will require the support of the NHS and partners for a long time��, said Jon Rouse, chief officer of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership.
In all 116 people were injured in the attack, almost double the 59 initially reported. Of those, 75 are still being treated in eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. However, the NHS said that the fact that 23 people were in a critical care unit did not mean that all were critically ill.
Dr Chris Moulton, the vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: �쏯HS emergency departments are well prepared for the possibility of a further terrorist attack, as has been demonstrated by the effective and well-coordinated response in Greater Manchester.
�쏣ach locality has its own well-rehearsed plan for similar situations. Emergency care staff work under great pressure at the best of times, but, in the event of a major incident, will always demonstrate skill, commitment and compassion. We are confident that, should such a terrible scenario occur again, the NHS and its staff will rise to meet the challenge.��
A new Gallup poll released Monday morning has a surprising finding: a majority of Americans - while supporting air strikes in foreign countries against foreign nationals suspected of Terrorism - oppose such air strikes when used to target US citizens who are suspected Terrorists, whether at home or on foreign soil:
The reason this is surprising is that when the US actually killed a US citizen on foreign soil on the grounds that he was a suspected Terrorist - Anwar al-Awlaki - large majorities approved. One poll at the time reported that "a large proportion of Americans believe the US Government made the correct decision in killing a US born Islamist militant in a drone strike last month" - specifically, that "69 per cent of respondents think the action taken by the US Government to kill Anwar al-Awlaki was justified" (that included 77% Republicans and 73% Democrats approving). Another poll at the time reported that Obama's approval ratings on national security increased eight points in the wake of the Awlaki killing. Meanwhile, Obama aides ran to Politico to boast that Awlaki's corpse would be a significant asset in Obama's re-election bid, leading to this Politico headline:
What can explain this obvious discrepancy? How can it be that a policy which a majority of Americans oppose (killing Americans on foreign soil on the grounds of suspected Terrorism) was so popular and politically beneficial for Obama when it was actually done to Awlaki? I'm not speaking here about those who support the US Government's right to kill US citizens on foreign soil without a trial: people who believe that and support the Awlaki execution are at least being consistent. I'm focusing here on how it can be that a majority of Americans say they oppose having Americans so targeted on foreign soil yet still support the Awlaki killing.
There are several possible factors explaining this discrepancy. It is probably easier to oppose such killings when considered in the abstract than it is when asked specifically about a person like Awlaki who had been subjected to such an intense government and media demonization campaign. It's also possible that intervening events between these polls - particularly the Rand Paul filibuster - created unprecedented media debate about the dangers of Obama's claimed assassination powers and caused people to re-think their wisdom (that was the ground cited by the ACLU's Laura Murphy when she praised Paul's protest: "As a result of Sen. Paul's historic filibuster, civil liberties got two wins: . . . Americans learned about the breathtakingly broad claims of executive authority undergirding the Obama administration's vast killing program").
But it seems clear there is a much more odious factor driving some of this. Many Americans can (a) say that they oppose the targeted killings of Americans on foreign soil while simultaneously (b) supporting the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen because, for them, the term "Americans" doesn't include people like Anwar al-Awlaki. "Americans" means their aunts and uncles, their nice neighbors down the street, and anyone else who looks like them, who looks and seems "American". They don't think those people - Americans - should be killed without charges by the US government if they travel on vacation to Paris or go to study for a semester in London. But the concept of "Americans" most definitely does not include people with foreign and Muslim-ish names like "Anwar al-Awlaki" who wear the white robes of a Muslim imam and spend time in a place like Yemen.
Legally - which is the only way that matters for this question - the New-Mexico-born Awlaki was every bit as much of an American citizen as the nice couple down the street. His citizenship was never legally revoked. He never formally renounced it. He was never charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime that could lead to the revocation of citizenship. No court ever considered revoking his citizenship, let alone did so. From a legal and constitutional perspective, there was not a single person "more American" than he. That's because those gradations of citizenship do not exist. One is either an American citizen or one is not. There is no such thing as "more American" or "less American", nor can one's citizenship be revoked by presidential decree. This does not exist.
But the effort to depict Muslims as something other than "real Americans" has long been a centerpiece of the US political climate in the era of the War on Terror. When it was first revealed in 2005 that the Bush administration was spying on the communications of Americans without the warrants required by the criminal law, a Bush White House spokesman sought to assure everyone that this wasn't targeting Real Americans, but only those Bad Ones that should be surveilled (meaning Muslims the Bush administration decided, without due process, were guilty):
Identically, when the Israelis attacked the Mavi Marmara flotilla in 2010 and killed 9 people including the US-born teenager Furkan Dogan, some conservatives insisted that he was not a Real American because his parents were Turkish and he grew up in Turkey ("it is silly to call him an 'American of Turkish descent'. He, like the other members of his family, was a Turk"). The stark contrast in reactions between the sustained fury of the Turkish government over the killing of their citizens by the Israelis versus the support for those killings given by the US government was accounted for in part by the blind US support for whatever Israel does (including killing Americans), but also by the belief that Dogan wasn't really an American, not the Real Kind you get upset about when a foreign army kills them.
This decade-long Othering of Muslims - a process necessary to sustain public support for their continuous killing, imprisonment, and various forms of rights abridgments - has taken its toll. I'm most certainly not suggesting that anyone who supports Awlaki's killing is driven by racism or anti-Muslim bigotry. I am suggesting that the belief that Muslims are somehow less American, or even less human, is widespread, and is a substantial factor in explaining the discrepancy I began by identifying.
Does anyone doubt that if Obama's bombs were killing nice white British teeangers or smiling blond Swiss infants - rather than unnamed Yemenis, Pakistanis, Afghans and Somalis - that the reaction to this sustained killing would be drastically different? Does anyone doubt that if his overhead buzzing drones were terrorizing Western European nations rather than predominantly Muslim ones, the horror of them would be much easier to grasp?
Does it really take any debate to know that if the 16-year-old American suspiciously killed by the US government two weeks after killing his father had been Jimmy Martin in Sweden rather than Abdulrahman al-Awlaki in Yemen, the media interest and public outcry would be far more substantial, and Robert Gibbs would have been widely scorned if he had offered this vile blame-the-victim justification for killing Jimmy rather than Abdulrahman? It is indisputably true that - just as conservatives argued that Furkan Dogan was not a Real American - large numbers of Americans believe the same about the Denver-born teenager named Abdulrahman. This ugly mindset is not the only factor that leads the US public to support more than a decade of US killing and rights abridgments aimed primarily at Muslims, including their fellow citizens, but it is certainly a significant one.
Amazingly, some Democratic partisans, in order to belittle these injustices, like to claim that only those who enjoy the luxury of racial and socioeconomic privilege would care so much about these issues. That claim is supremely ironic. It reverses reality. That type of privilege is not what leads one to care about and work against these injustices. To the contrary, it's exactly that privilege that causes one to dismiss concerns over these injustices and mock and scorn those who work against them. The people who insist that these abuses are insignificant and get too much attention are not the ones affected by them, because they're not Muslim, and thus do not care.
The perception that the state violence, rights abridgments and expansions of government power ushered in by the War on Terror affect only Muslims long ago stopped being true. But ensuring that people continue to believe that is the key reason why it has been permitted to continue for so long.
The New Jersey Star Ledger this morning has an excellent interview with CUNY Professor Diala Shamas, who just co-authored a new report on the devastating impact of the NYPD's shockingly invasive and indsicriminate surveillance program aimed at Muslim communities in New York and New Jersey. She documents in particular how this type of surveillance, aimed at innocent Muslims, creates an intense climate of fear and chills political speech. Would anyone tolerate having such sweeping surveillance programs infiltrating Jewish or Christian communities in the US? I once asked this question of leading New York Mayoral candidate Christine Quinn, who supports the NYPD program, and she refused to answer). But the answer is obvious: of course not. That is the point.
The ACLU's Jameel Jaffer perfectly summarizes the point I am making from those polls:
At around 8pm on Sunday 29 January, a young man walked into a mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood of Quebec City and opened fire on worshippers with a 9mm handgun. The imam had just finished leading the congregation in prayer when the intruder started shooting at them. He killed six and injured 19 more. The dead included an IT specialist employed by the city council, a grocer, and a science professor.
The suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette, a 27-year-old student, has been charged with six counts of murder, though not terrorism. Within hours of the attack, Ralph Goodale, the Canadian minister for public safety, described the killer as �쏿 lone wolf��. His statement was rapidly picked up by the world�셲 media.
Goodale�셲 statement came as no surprise. In early 2017, well into the second decade of the most intense wave of international terrorism since the 1970s, the lone wolf has, for many observers, come to represent the most urgent security threat faced by the west. The term, which describes an individual actor who strikes alone and is not affiliated with any larger group, is now widely used by politicians, journalists, security officials and the general public. It is used for Islamic militant attackers and, as the shooting in Quebec shows, for killers with other ideological motivations. Within hours of the news breaking of an attack on pedestrians and a policeman in central London last week, it was used to describe the 52-year-old British convert responsible. Yet few beyond the esoteric world of terrorism analysis appear to give this almost ubiquitous term much thought.
Terrorism has changed dramatically in recent years. Attacks by groups with defined chains of command have become rarer, as the prevalence of terrorist networks, autonomous cells, and, in rare cases, individuals, has grown. This evolution has prompted a search for a new vocabulary, as it should. The label that seems to have been decided on is �쐋one wolves��. They are, we have been repeatedly told, �쏷error enemy No 1��.
Yet using the term as liberally as we do is a mistake. Labels frame the way we see the world, and thus influence attitudes and eventually policies. Using the wrong words to describe problems that we need to understand distorts public perceptions, as well as the decisions taken by our leaders. Lazy talk of �쐋one wolves�� obscures the real nature of the threat against us, and makes us all less safe.
The image of the lone wolf who splits from the pack has been a staple of popular culture since the 19th century, cropping up in stories about empire and exploration from British India to the wild west. From 1914 onwards, the term was popularised by a bestselling series of crime novels and films centred upon a criminal-turned-good-guy nicknamed Lone Wolf. Around that time, it also began to appear in US law enforcement circles and newspapers. In April 1925, the New York Times reported on a man who �쏿ssumed the title of �쁋one Wolf�쇺��, who terrorised women in a Boston apartment building. But it would be many decades before the term came to be associated with terrorism.
In the 1960s and 1970s, waves of rightwing and leftwing terrorism struck the US and western Europe. It was often hard to tell who was responsible: hierarchical groups, diffuse networks or individuals effectively operating alone. Still, the majority of actors belonged to organisations modelled on existing military or revolutionary groups. Lone actors were seen as eccentric oddities, not as the primary threat.
The modern concept of lone-wolf terrorism was developed by rightwing extremists in the US. In 1983, at a time when far-right organisations were coming under immense pressure from the FBI, a white nationalist named Louis Beam published a manifesto that called for �쐋eaderless resistance�� to the US government. Beam, who was a member of both the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations group, was not the first extremist to elaborate the strategy, but he is one of the best known. He told his followers that only a movement based on �쐖ery small or even one-man cells of resistance �� could combat the most powerful government on earth��.
Experts still argue over how much impact the thinking of Beam and other like-minded white supremacists had on rightwing extremists in the US. Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people with a bomb directed at a government office in Oklahoma City in 1995, is sometimes cited as an example of someone inspired by their ideas. But McVeigh had told others of his plans, had an accomplice, and had been involved for many years with rightwing militia groups. McVeigh may have thought of himself as a lone wolf, but he was not one.
One far-right figure who made explicit use of the term lone wolf was Tom Metzger, the leader of White Aryan Resistance, a group based in Indiana. Metzger is thought to have authored, or at least published on his website, a call to arms entitled �쏬aws for the Lone Wolf��. �쏧 am preparing for the coming War. I am ready when the line is crossed �� I am the underground Insurgent fighter and independent. I am in your neighborhoods, schools, police departments, bars, coffee shops, malls, etc. I am, The Lone Wolf!,�� it reads.
From the mid-1990s onwards, as Metzger�셲 ideas began to spread, the number of hate crimes committed by self-styled �쐋eaderless�� rightwing extremists rose. In 1998, the FBI launched Operation Lone Wolf against a small group of white supremacists on the US west coast. A year later, Alex Curtis, a young, influential rightwing extremist and protege of Metzger, told his hundreds of followers in an email that �쐋one wolves who are smart and commit to action in a cold-mannered way can accomplish virtually any task before them ... We are already too far along to try to educate the white masses and we cannot worry about [their] reaction to lone wolf/small cell strikes.��
The same year, the New York Times published a long article on the new threat headlined �쏯ew Face of Terror Crimes: �쁋one Wolf�� Weaned on Hate��. This seems to have been the moment when the idea of terrorist �쐋one wolves�� began to migrate from rightwing extremist circles, and the law enforcement officials monitoring them, to the mainstream. In court on charges of hate crimes in 2000, Curtis was described by prosecutors as an advocate of lone-wolf terrorism.
When, more than a decade later, the term finally became a part of the everyday vocabulary of millions of people, it was in a dramatically different context.
After 9/11, lone-wolf terrorism suddenly seemed like a distraction from more serious threats. The 19 men who carried out the attacks were jihadis who had been hand picked, trained, equipped and funded by Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, and a small group of close associates.
Although 9/11 was far from a typical terrorist attack, it quickly came to dominate thinking about the threat from Islamic militants. Security services built up organograms of terrorist groups. Analysts focused on individual terrorists only insofar as they were connected to bigger entities. Personal relations �� particularly friendships based on shared ambitions and battlefield experiences, as well as tribal or familial links �� were mistaken for institutional ones, formally connecting individuals to organisations and placing them under a chain of command.
This approach suited the institutions and individuals tasked with carrying out the �쐗ar on terror��. For prosecutors, who were working with outdated legislation, proving membership of a terrorist group was often the only way to secure convictions of individuals planning violence. For a number of governments around the world �� Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt �� linking attacks on their soil to �쏿l-Qaida�� became a way to shift attention away from their own brutality, corruption and incompetence, and to gain diplomatic or material benefits from Washington. For some officials in Washington, linking terrorist attacks to �쐓tate-sponsored�� groups became a convenient way to justify policies, such as the continuing isolation of Iran, or military interventions such as the invasion of Iraq. For many analysts and policymakers, who were heavily influenced by the conventional wisdom on terrorism inherited from the cold war, thinking in terms of hierarchical groups and state sponsors was comfortably familiar.
A final factor was more subtle. Attributing the new wave of violence to a single group not only obscured the deep, complex and troubling roots of Islamic militancy but also suggested the threat it posed would end when al-Qaida was finally eliminated. This was reassuring, both for decision-makers and the public.
By the middle of the decade, it was clear that this analysis was inadequate. Bombs in Bali, Istanbul and Mombasa were the work of centrally organised attackers, but the 2004 attack on trains in Madrid had been executed by a small network only tenuously connected to the al-Qaida senior leadership 4,000 miles away. For every operation like the 2005 bombings in London �� which was close to the model established by the 9/11 attacks �� there were more attacks that didn�셳 seem to have any direct link to Bin Laden, even if they might have been inspired by his ideology. There was growing evidence that the threat from Islamic militancy was evolving into something different, something closer to the �쐋eaderless resistance�� promoted by white supremacists two decades earlier.
As the 2000s drew to a close, attacks perpetrated by people who seemed to be acting alone began to outnumber all others. These events were less deadly than the spectacular strikes of a few years earlier, but the trend was alarming. In the UK in 2008, a convert to Islam with mental health problems attempted to blow up a restaurant in Exeter, though he injured no one but himself. In 2009, a US army major shot 13 dead in Fort Hood, Texas. In 2010, a female student stabbed an MP in London. None appeared, initially, to have any broader connections to the global jihadi movement.
In an attempt to understand how this new threat had developed, analysts raked through the growing body of texts posted online by jihadi thinkers. It seemed that one strategist had been particularly influential: a Syrian called Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, better known as Abu Musab al-Suri. In 2004, in a sprawling set of writings posted on an extremist website, Nasar had laid out a new strategy that was remarkably similar to �쐋eaderless resistance��, although there is no evidence that he knew of the thinking of men such as Beam or Metzger. Nasar�셲 maxim was �쏱rinciples, not organisations��. He envisaged individual attackers and cells, guided by texts published online, striking targets across the world.
Having identified this new threat, security officials, journalists and policymakers needed a new vocabulary to describe it. The rise of the term lone wolf wasn�셳 wholly unprecedented. In the aftermath of 9/11, the US had passed anti-terror legislation that included a so-called �쐋one wolf provision��. This made it possible to pursue terrorists who were members of groups based abroad but who were acting alone in the US. Yet this provision conformed to the prevailing idea that all terrorists belonged to bigger groups and acted on orders from their superiors. The stereotype of the lone wolf terrorist that dominates today�셲 media landscape was not yet fully formed.
It is hard to be exact about when things changed. By around 2006, a small number of analysts had begun to refer to lone-wolf attacks in the context of Islamic militancy, and Israeli officials were using the term to describe attacks by apparently solitary Palestinian attackers. Yet these were outliers. In researching this article, I called eight counter-terrorism officials active over the last decade to ask them when they had first heard references to lone-wolf terrorism. One said around 2008, three said 2009, three 2010 and one around 2011. �쏷he expression is what gave the concept traction,�� Richard Barrett, who held senior counter-terrorist positions in MI6, the British overseas intelligence service, and the UN through the period, told me. Before the rise of the lone wolf, security officials used phrases �� all equally flawed �� such as �쐆omegrowns��, �쐁leanskins��, �쐄reelancers�� or simply �쐕naffiliated��.
As successive jihadi plots were uncovered that did not appear to be linked to al-Qaida or other such groups, the term became more common. Between 2009 and 2012 it appears in around 300 articles in major English-language news publications each year, according the professional cuttings search engine Lexis Nexis. Since then, the term has become ubiquitous. In the 12 months before the London attack last week, the number of references to �쐋one wolves�� exceeded the total of those over the previous three years, topping 1,000.
Lone wolves are now apparently everywhere, stalking our streets, schools and airports. Yet, as with the tendency to attribute all terrorist attacks to al-Qaida a decade earlier, this is a dangerous simplification.
In March 2012, a 23-year-old petty criminal named Mohamed Merah went on a shooting spree �� a series of three attacks over a period of nine days �� in south-west France, killing seven people. Bernard Squarcini, head of the French domestic intelligence service, described Merah as a lone wolf. So did the interior ministry spokesman, and, inevitably, many journalists. A year later, Lee Rigby, an off-duty soldier, was run over and hacked to death in London. Once again, the two attackers were dubbed lone wolves by officials and the media. So, too, were Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013. The same label has been applied to more recent attackers, including the men who drove vehicles into crowds in Nice and Berlin last year, and in London last week.
One problem facing security services, politicians and the media is that instant analysis is difficult. It takes months to unravel the truth behind a major, or even minor, terrorist operation. The demand for information from a frightened public, relayed by a febrile news media, is intense. People seek quick, familiar explanations.
Yet many of the attacks that have been confidently identified as lone-wolf operations have turned out to be nothing of the sort. Very often, terrorists who are initially labelled lone wolves, have active links to established groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Merah, for instance, had recently travelled to Pakistan and been trained, albeit cursorily, by a jihadi group allied with al-Qaida. Merah was also linked to a network of local extremists, some of whom went on to carry out attacks in Libya, Iraq and Syria. Bernard Cazeneuve, who was then the French interior minister, later agreed that calling Merah a lone wolf had been a mistake.
If, in cases such as Merah�셲, the label of lone wolf is plainly incorrect, there are other, more subtle cases where it is still highly misleading. Another category of attackers, for instance, are those who strike alone, without guidance from formal terrorist organisations, but who have had face-to-face contact with loose networks of people who share extremist beliefs. The Exeter restaurant bomber, dismissed as an unstable loner, was actually in contact with a circle of local militant sympathisers before his attack. (They have never been identified.) The killers of Lee Rigby had been on the periphery of extremist movements in the UK for years, appearing at rallies of groups such as the now proscribed al-Muhajiroun, run by Anjem Choudary, a preacher convicted of terrorist offences in 2016 who is reported to have �쐇nspired�� up to 100 British militants.
A third category is made up of attackers who strike alone, after having had close contact online, rather than face-to-face, with extremist groups or individuals. A wave of attackers in France last year were, at first, wrongly seen as lone wolves �쐇nspired�� rather than commissioned by Isis. It soon emerged that the individuals involved, such as the two teenagers who killed a priest in front of his congregation in Normandy, had been recruited online by a senior Isis militant. In three recent incidents in Germany, all initially dubbed �쐋one-wolf attacks��, Isis militants actually used messaging apps to direct recruits in the minutes before they attacked. �쏱ray that I become a martyr,�� one attacker who assaulted passengers on a train with an axe and knife told his interlocutor. �쏧 am now waiting for the train.�� Then: �쏧 am starting now.��
Very often, what appear to be the clearest lone-wolf cases are revealed to be more complex. Even the strange case of the man who killed 86 people with a truck in Nice in July 2016 �� with his background of alcohol abuse, casual sex and lack of apparent interest in religion or radical ideologies �� may not be a true lone wolf. Eight of his friends and associates have been arrested and police are investigating his potential links to a broader network.
What research does show is that we may be more likely to find lone wolves among far-right extremists than among their jihadi counterparts. Though even in those cases, the term still conceals more than it reveals.
The murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, days before the EU referendum, by a 52-year-old called Thomas Mair, was the culmination of a steady intensification of rightwing extremist violence in the UK that had been largely ignored by the media and policymakers. According to police, on several occasions attackers came close to causing more casualties in a single operation than jihadis had ever inflicted. The closest call came in 2013 when Pavlo Lapshyn, a Ukrainian PhD student in the UK, planted a bomb outside a mosque in Tipton, West Midlands. Fortunately, Lapshyn had got his timings wrong and the congregation had yet to gather when the device exploded. Embedded in the trunks of trees surrounding the building, police found some of the 100 nails Lapshyn had added to the bomb to make it more lethal.
Lapshyn was a recent arrival, but the UK has produced numerous homegrown far-right extremists in recent years. One was Martyn Gilleard, who was sentenced to 16 years for terrorism and child pornography offences in 2008. When officers searched his home in Goole, East Yorkshire, they found knives, guns, machetes, swords, axes, bullets and four nail bombs. A year later, Ian Davison became the first Briton convicted under new legislation dealing with the production of chemical weapons. Davison was sentenced to 10 years in prison for manufacturing ricin, a lethal biological poison made from castor beans. His aim, the court heard, was �쐔he creation of an international Aryan group who would establish white supremacy in white countries��.
Lapshyn, Gilleard and Davison were each described as lone wolves by police officers, judges and journalists. Yet even a cursory survey of their individual stories undermines this description. Gilleard was the local branch organiser of a neo-Nazi group, while Davison founded the Aryan Strike Force, the members of which went on training days in Cumbria where they flew swastika flags.
Thomas Mair, who was also widely described as a lone wolf, does appear to have been an authentic loner, yet his involvement in rightwing extremism goes back decades. In May 1999, the National Alliance, a white-supremacist organisation in West Virginia, sent Mair manuals that explained how to construct bombs and assemble homemade pistols. Seventeen years later, when police raided his home after the murder, they found stacks of far-right literature, Nazi memorabilia and cuttings on Anders Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist who murdered 77 people in 2011.
Even Breivik himself, who has been called �쐔he deadliest lone-wolf attacker in [Europe�셲] history��, was not a true lone wolf. Prior to his arrest, Breivik had long been in contact with far-right organisations. A member of the English Defence League told the Telegraph that Breivik had been in regular contact with its members via Facebook, and had a �쐆ypnotic�� effect on them.
If such facts fit awkwardly with the commonly accepted idea of the lone wolf, they fit better with academic research that has shown that very few violent extremists act without letting others know what they may be planning. In the late 1990s, after realising that in most instances school shooters would reveal their intentions to close associates before acting, the FBI began to talk about �쐋eakage�� of critical information. By 2009, it had extended the concept to terrorist attacks, and found that �쐋eakage�� was identifiable in more than four-fifths of 80 ongoing cases they were investigating. Of these leaks, 95% were to friends, close relatives or authority figures.
More recent research has underlined the garrulous nature of violent extremists. In 2013, researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined the interactions of 119 lone-wolf terrorists from a wide variety of ideological and faith backgrounds. The academics found that, even though the terrorists launched their attacks alone, in 79% of cases others were aware of the individual�셲 extremist ideology, and in 64% of cases family and friends were aware of the individual�셲 intent to engage in terrorism-related activity. Another more recent survey found that 45% of Islamic militant cases talked about their inspiration and possible actions with family and friends. While only 18% of rightwing counterparts did, they were much more likely to �쐏ost telling indicators�� on the internet.
Few extremists remain without human contact, even if that contact is only found online. Last year, a team at the University of Miami studied 196 pro-Isis groups operating on social media during the first eight months of 2015. These groups had a combined total of more than 100,000 members. Researchers also found that pro-Isis individuals who were not in a group �� who they dubbed �쐎nline �쁫one wolf�� actors�� �� had either recently been in a group or soon went on to join one.
There is a much broader point here. Any terrorist, however socially or physically isolated, is still part of a broader movement. The lengthy manifesto that Breivik published hours before he started killing drew heavily on a dense ecosystem of far-right blogs, websites and writers. His ideas on strategy drew directly from the �쐋eaderless resistance�� school of Beam and others. Even his musical tastes were shaped by his ideology. He was, for example, a fan of Saga, a Swedish white nationalist singer, whose lyrics include lines about �쏷he greatest race to ever walk the earth �� betrayed��.
It is little different for Islamic militants, who emerge as often from the fertile and desperately depressing world of online jihadism �� with its execution videos, mythologised history, selectively read religious texts and Photoshopped pictures of alleged atrocities against Muslims �� as from organised groups that meet in person.
Terrorist violence of all kinds is directed against specific targets. These are not selected at random, nor are such attacks the products of a fevered and irrational imagination operating in complete isolation.
Just like the old idea that a single organisation, al-Qaida, was responsible for all Islamic terrorism, the rise of the lone-wolf paradigm is convenient for many different actors. First, there are the terrorists themselves. The notion that we are surrounded by anonymous lone wolves poised to strike at any time inspires fear and polarises the public. What could be more alarming and divisive than the idea that someone nearby �� perhaps a colleague, a neighbour, a fellow commuter �� might secretly be a lone wolf?
Terrorist groups also need to work constantly to motivate their activists. The idea of �쐋one wolves�� invests murderous attackers with a special status, even glamour. Breivik, for instance, congratulated himself in his manifesto for becoming a �쐓elf-financed and self-indoctrinated single individual attack cell��. Al-Qaida propaganda lauded the 2009 Fort Hood shooter as �쏿 pioneer, a trailblazer, and a role model who has opened a door, lit a path, and shown the way forward for every Muslim who finds himself among the unbelievers��.
The lone-wolf paradigm can be helpful for security services and policymakers, too, since the public assumes that lone wolves are difficult to catch. This would be justified if the popular image of the lone wolf as a solitary actor was accurate. But, as we have seen, this is rarely the case.
The reason that many attacks are not prevented is not because it was impossible to anticipate the perpetrator�셲 actions, but because someone screwed up. German law enforcement agencies were aware that the man who killed 12 in Berlin before Christmas was an Isis sympathiser and had talked about committing an attack. Repeated attempts to deport him had failed, stymied by bureaucracy, lack of resources and poor case preparation. In Britain, a parliamentary report into the killing of Lee Rigby identified a number of serious delays and potential missed opportunities to prevent it. Khalid Masood, the man who attacked Westminster last week, was identified in 2010 as a potential extremist by MI5.
But perhaps the most disquieting explanation for the ubiquity of the term is that it tells us something we want to believe. Yes, the terrorist threat now appears much more amorphous and unpredictable than ever before. At the same time, the idea that terrorists operate alone allows us to break the link between an act of violence and its ideological hinterland. It implies that the responsibility for an individual�셲 violent extremism lies solely with the individual themselves.
The truth is much more disturbing. Terrorism is not something you do by yourself, it is highly social. People become interested in ideas, ideologies and activities, even appalling ones, because other people are interested in them.
In his eulogy at the funeral of those killed in the mosque shooting in Quebec, the imam Hassan Guillet spoke of the alleged shooter. Over previous days details had emerged of the young man�셲 life. �쏛lexandre [Bissonette], before being a killer, was a victim himself,�� said Hassan. �쏝efore he planted his bullets in the heads of his victims, somebody planted ideas more dangerous than the bullets in his head. Unfortunately, day after day, week after week, month after month, certain politicians, and certain reporters and certain media, poisoned our atmosphere.
�쏻e did not want to see it ��. because we love this country, we love this society. We wanted our society to be perfect. We were like some parents who, when a neighbour tells them their kid is smoking or taking drugs, answers: �쁈 don�셳 believe it, my child is perfect.�� We don�셳 want to see it. And we didn�셳 see it, and it happened.��
�쏝ut,�� he went on to say, �쐔here was a certain malaise. Let us face it. Alexandre Bissonnette didn�셳 emerge from a vacuum.��

Especially for young men, mortal combat in the service of a great cause provides the ultimate adventure and maximum esteem in the eyes of many and, most dearly, in the hearts of their peers. One heroic cause for disaffected souls in the world today is jihad, through which anyone from anywhere can make a mark against the most powerful countries and armies in the history of the world. How glorious to cut off Goliath's head with a box cutter �� or at least cause him a big headache.
Yet, although many millions of people express sympathy with al-Qaida's viral social movement or other forms of violent political expression that abuse religion and support terrorism, relatively few willingly use violence. Following a 2001-2007 survey of 35 predominantly Muslim nations, a Gallup study estimated that 7% of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims thought that the 9/11 attacks were "completely justified". That's about 100 million people; however, of these many millions who express support for violence against the outgroup, there are only thousands willing to actually commit violence.
This is also true in the Muslim diaspora, which provides the overwhelming majority of al-Qaida followers. In the European Union, fewer than 3,000 suspects have been imprisoned for jihadi activities out of a Muslim population of perhaps 20 million. In the United States, fewer than 500 suspects have been arrested for having anything remotely to do with support for holy war against America after 9/11, with less than 100 cases being considered serious out of an immigrant Muslim population of more than two million.
If so many millions support jihad, why are only relatively few willing to kill and die for it? Although heroic action for a great cause is the ultimate end, the path to violent extremism is mostly a matter of individual motivations and small group dynamics in specific historical contexts. Those who go on to violence generally do so by way of family and friends within specific "scenes": neighbourhoods, schools (classes, dorms), workplaces, common leisure activities (soccer, barbershop, caf챕), and, increasingly, online chat rooms.
The process of self selection into violence within these scenes is stimulated by a massive, media-driven political awakening in which jihad is represented as the only the way to permanently resolve glaring problems of global injustice. When this perceived injustice resonates with frustrated personal aspirations, violence may be seen as a way out. Al-Qaida and its associates do not so much recruit as attract and enlist those disaffected people who have already decided to embark on the path to violent extremism with the help of a few fellow travellers.
Research shows that terrorists generally don't commit terrorism because they are extraordinarily vengeful or uncaring, poor or uneducated, schooled as children in radical religion or brainwashed, criminally-minded or suicidal, or sex-starved for virgins in heaven. Most have no personal history of violent emotions and generally peaceful in their daily lives but become "born again" into a radical cause.
Before and just after 9/11, jihadis, including suicide bombers, were on average materially better-off and better-educated relative to their populations of origin. Many had college educations or advanced technical training. A background in science, particularly engineering and medicine, was positively associated with the likelihood of joining jihad. Now, the main threat to the west isn't from any organisation, or from well-trained cadres of volunteers, but from an al-Qaida-inspired viral social movement that is particularly contagious among young adults who are in transition stages in their lives: immigrants, students, those still in search of friends, mates or jobs.
The popular notion of a "clash of civilizations" is woefully misleading. Violent extremism represents the collapse of traditional territorial cultures, not their resurgence, as people unmoored from millennial traditions flail about in search of a social identity. Individuals now mostly radicalise horizontally with their peers, rather than vertically through institutional leaders or organisational hierarchies: in small groups of friends �� from the same neighbourhood or social network �� or even as loners who find common cause with a virtual internet community. Appeals to moderate Islam are about as irrelevant as older people appealing to adolescents to moderate their music or clothes.
In the long run, perhaps the most important counterterrorism measure of all is to provide alternative heroes and hopes that are more enticing and empowering than any moral lessons or material offerings (jobs that help to relieve the terrible boredom and inactivity of immigrant youth in Europe and the underemployed throughout much of the Muslim world, will not alone offset the allure of playing at war). It is also important to provide alternate local networks and chatrooms that speak to the inherent idealism, sense of risk and adventure, and need for peer approval that young people everywhere tend toward. It could even be a 21st-century version of what the Boy Scouts and high school football teams did for immigrants and potentially troublesome youth as America urbanised a century ago. Ask any cop on the beat: those things work. It has to be done with the input and insight of local communities, and chiefly peer-to-peer, or it won't be effective: deradicalisation, like radicalisation itself, works mainly from the bottom up, not from the top down. This, of course, is not how you stop terrorism today, but how you do it for tomorrow.
The home secretary, John Reid, today said such an attack could have caused civilian casualties on an "unprecedented scale".
It is believed the intention was to set off near simultaneous blasts on flights, probably bound for the US, using explosives smuggled into passenger cabins inside hand luggage.
Police were holding 24 people in custody in London following overnight raids by anti-terror officers and MI5. Mr Reid would not comment on claims that the detainees were British-born Muslims of Pakistani descent.
A decision was made to move suddenly following months of surveillance. US counter-terrorism officials told the Associated Press that three major US airlines - United, American Airlines and Continental - had been targeted in the plot.
The aim of the plot was to blow up planes over UK and US cities, Sky News reported. Five US cities are thought to have been among the targets, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles, it added.
The plans could have been carried out in the next two days, a White House spokesman said today. He added that Tony Blair and George Bush had discussed the plot on Sunday and Wednesday.
Reports citing official sources said the apparent idea was to use a liquid-based explosive, and there were suggestions one explosive component was to have been hidden in bottles of fizzy drink.
President Bush said the was a "stark reminder" that the US was "at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom." He thanked the British government for "busting this plot".
There is major disruption to flights in the UK, and European airlines have cancelled hundreds of flights into London. Flights at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted airports have been particularly disrupted. It is believed that up to 400,000 passengers have been affected.
Emergency restrictions were in place at British airports, barring passengers from taking any liquids or other hand luggage, apart from travel documents and essential prescriptions, on board. Heathrow officials said all milk for babies would have to be tasted by an "accompanying passenger".
There were no firm indications of plans for an attack to have been carried out today, but the US homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, said it was a "well advanced" scheme. He said the plot was based in Britain but was "international in scope".
Mr Chertoff said: "They had accumulated the capability necessary and they were well on their way."
"This wasn't supposed to happen today," a US official who asked not to be named, told the Washington Post. "It was supposed to happen several days from now. We hear the British lost track of one or two guys. They had to move."
The US attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, said it was "suggestive of al-Qaida tactics". British officials were more circumspect about the background to the plot than their US counterparts, stressing that they had to be careful about what they said because there could be trials in future.
Officials also declined to confirm the number of flights believed to have been targets - sources said up to 10 - and the home secretary would only say the alleged intention was to carry out a "wave" of attacks.
Paul Stephenson, the deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police, spoke of the threat of "mass murder" on an "unimaginable scale".
Mr Reid said there was confidence that the plot's "main players have been accounted for", but added that officials were not being "complacent".
Most of the suspects detained overnight were arrested in east London. Two people were also arrested in Birmingham, and Mr Stephenson said there had also been an operation in the Thames Valley.
Thames Valley Police said homes in High Wycombe were also being searched. But a spokesman stressed there was not thought to be a direct threat to people in the area.
Peter Clarke, the head of the Metropolitan police's anti-terror branch, said the operation had involved an "unprecedented level of surveillance" and had reached a "critical point" last night when officers move to "protect the public".
The focus of the long investigation had been on the "meetings, movement, travel pending and the aspirations of a large group of people", and the alleged plot had "global dimensions", he said.
At 2am, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre raised the UK terror alert from severe to critical - its highest level - for the first time. The Home Office website defines critical as meaning an attack is expected imminently.
The US government responded by raising its threat assessment to red, the highest level, for commercial flights from Britain. Passengers in the US have also been prohibited from carrying liquids or lotions on flights.
Mr Chertoff said the plotters had "planned to carry the components of the bombs disguised as beverages, electronic devices or other common objects". Components could then be mixed on board to create explosives, he said.
If 10 planes had been targeted, it would have been by far the most ambitious terror plot since the September 11 2001 attacks in the US killed more than 2,700 people.
Downing Street said Tony Blair, who is on holiday in the Caribbean, was being kept constantly informed of developments and had briefed the US president, George Bush, overnight.
The anti-terror operations were carried out with Mr Blair's "full support", No 10 said.
The restrictions caused delays of up to five hours on some flights, and the disruption was expected to last for several days.
All passengers were hand searched, and their footwear and all items they were carrying x-ray screened. Laptop computers, mobile phones and iPods are among the items banned from being carried on board.
At Heathrow terminal one and Manchester airport, huge queues stretched the length of the departure lounge this morning.
Yesterday, Mr Reid said Britain was facing its most sustained period of serious threat since the end of the second world war and told critics of the government's controversial anti-terror tactics that they "just don't get it".
In recent months, officials have said several plots had been foiled since the July 7 London bombings, in which 52 people died.
Three days before Christmas 2001, Briton Richard Reid, who pledged allegiance to al-Qaida, tried to set off explosives in his shoes while on an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami.
Since the attacks on the United States in September 2001, there have been more than a thousand references in British national newspapers, working out at almost one every single day, to the phrase "dirty bomb". There have been articles about how such a device can use ordinary explosives to spread lethal radiation; about how London would be evacuated in the event of such a detonation; about the Home Secretary David Blunkett's statement on terrorism in November 2002 that specifically raised the possibility of a dirty bomb being planted in Britain; and about the arrests of several groups of people, the latest only last month, for allegedly plotting exactly that.
Starting next Wednesday, BBC2 is to broadcast a three-part documentary series that will add further to what could be called the dirty bomb genre. But, as its title suggests, The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear takes a different view of the weapon's potential.
"I don't think it would kill anybody," says Dr Theodore Rockwell, an authority on radiation, in an interview for the series. "You'll have trouble finding a serious report that would claim otherwise." The American department of energy, Rockwell continues, has simulated a dirty bomb explosion, "and they calculated that the most exposed individual would get a fairly high dose [of radiation], not life-threatening." And even this minor threat is open to question. The test assumed that no one fled the explosion for one year.
During the three years in which the "war on terror" has been waged, high-profile challenges to its assumptions have been rare. The sheer number of incidents and warnings connected or attributed to the war has left little room, it seems, for heretical thoughts. In this context, the central theme of The Power of Nightmares is riskily counter-intuitive and provocative. Much of the currently perceived threat from international terrorism, the series argues, "is a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians. It is a dark illusion that has spread unquestioned through governments around the world, the security services, and the international media." The series' explanation for this is even bolder: "In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power."
Adam Curtis, who wrote and produced the series, acknowledges the difficulty of saying such things now. "If a bomb goes off, the fear I have is that everyone will say, 'You're completely wrong,' even if the incident doesn't touch my argument. This shows the way we have all become trapped, the way even I have become trapped by a fear that is completely irrational."
So controversial is the tone of his series, that trailers for it were not broadcast last weekend because of the killing of Kenneth Bigley. At the BBC, Curtis freely admits, there are "anxieties". But there is also enthusiasm for the programmes, in part thanks to his reputation. Over the past dozen years, via similarly ambitious documentary series such as Pandora's Box, The Mayfair Set and The Century of the Self, Curtis has established himself as perhaps the most acclaimed maker of serious television programmes in Britain. His trademarks are long research, the revelatory use of archive footage, telling interviews, and smooth, insistent voiceovers concerned with the unnoticed deeper currents of recent history, narrated by Curtis himself in tones that combine traditional BBC authority with something more modern and sceptical: "I want to try to make people look at things they think they know about in a new way."
The Power of Nightmares seeks to overturn much of what is widely believed about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. The latter, it argues, is not an organised international network. It does not have members or a leader. It does not have "sleeper cells". It does not have an overall strategy. In fact, it barely exists at all, except as an idea about cleansing a corrupt world through religious violence.
Curtis' evidence for these assertions is not easily dismissed. He tells the story of Islamism, or the desire to establish Islam as an unbreakable political framework, as half a century of mostly failed, short-lived revolutions and spectacular but politically ineffective terrorism. Curtis points out that al-Qaida did not even have a name until early 2001, when the American government decided to prosecute Bin Laden in his absence and had to use anti-Mafia laws that required the existence of a named criminal organisation.
Curtis also cites the Home Office's own statistics for arrests and convictions of suspected terrorists since September 11 2001. Of the 664 people detained up to the end of last month, only 17 have been found guilty. Of these, the majority were Irish Republicans, Sikh militants or members of other groups with no connection to Islamist terrorism. Nobody has been convicted who is a proven member of al-Qaida.
In fact, Curtis is not alone in wondering about all this. Quietly but increasingly, other observers of the war on terror have been having similar doubts. "The grand concept of the war has not succeeded," says Jonathan Eyal, director of the British military thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. "In purely military terms, it has been an inconclusive war ... a rather haphazard operation. Al-Qaida managed the most spectacular attack, but clearly it is also being sustained by the way that we rather cavalierly stick the name al-Qaida on Iraq, Indonesia, the Philippines. There is a long tradition that if you divert all your resources to a threat, then you exaggerate it."
Bill Durodie, director of the international centre for security analysis at King's College London, says: "The reality [of the al-Qaida threat to the west] has been essentially a one-off. There has been one incident in the developed world since 9/11 [the Madrid bombings]. There's no real evidence that all these groups are connected." Crispin Black, a senior government intelligence analyst until 2002, is more cautious but admits the terrorist threat presented by politicians and the media is "out of date and too one-dimensional. We think there is a bit of a gulf between the terrorists' ambition and their ability to pull it off."
Terrorism, by definition, depends on an element of bluff. Yet ever since terrorists in the modern sense of the term (the word terrorism was actually coined to describe the strategy of a government, the authoritarian French revolutionary regime of the 1790s) began to assassinate politicians and then members of the public during the 19th century, states have habitually overreacted. Adam Roberts, professor of international relations at Oxford, says that governments often believe struggles with terrorists "to be of absolute cosmic significance", and that therefore "anything goes" when it comes to winning. The historian Linda Colley adds: "States and their rulers expect to monopolise violence, and that is why they react so virulently to terrorism."
Britain may also be particularly sensitive to foreign infiltrators, fifth columnists and related menaces. In spite, or perhaps because of, the absence of an actual invasion for many centuries, British history is marked by frequent panics about the arrival of Spanish raiding parties, French revolutionary agitators, anarchists, bolsheviks and Irish terrorists. "These kind of panics rarely happen without some sort of cause," says Colley. "But politicians make the most of them."
They are not the only ones who find opportunities. "Almost no one questions this myth about al-Qaida because so many people have got an interest in keeping it alive," says Curtis. He cites the suspiciously circular relationship between the security services and much of the media since September 2001: the way in which official briefings about terrorism, often unverified or unverifiable by journalists, have become dramatic press stories which - in a jittery media-driven democracy - have prompted further briefings and further stories. Few of these ominous announcements are retracted if they turn out to be baseless: "There is no fact-checking about al-Qaida."
In one sense, of course, Curtis himself is part of the al-Qaida industry. The Power of Nightmares began as an investigation of something else, the rise of modern American conservatism. Curtis was interested in Leo Strauss, a political philosopher at the university of Chicago in the 50s who rejected the liberalism of postwar America as amoral and who thought that the country could be rescued by a revived belief in America's unique role to battle evil in the world. Strauss's certainty and his emphasis on the use of grand myths as a higher form of political propaganda created a group of influential disciples such as Paul Wolfowitz, now the US deputy defence secretary. They came to prominence by talking up the Russian threat during the cold war and have applied a similar strategy in the war on terror.
As Curtis traced the rise of the "Straussians", he came to a conclusion that would form the basis for The Power of Nightmares. Straussian conservatism had a previously unsuspected amount in common with Islamism: from origins in the 50s, to a formative belief that liberalism was the enemy, to an actual period of Islamist-Straussian collaboration against the Soviet Union during the war in Afghanistan in the 80s (both movements have proved adept at finding new foes to keep them going). Although the Islamists and the Straussians have fallen out since then, as the attacks on America in 2001 graphically demonstrated, they are in another way, Curtis concludes, collaborating still: in sustaining the "fantasy" of the war on terror.
Some may find all this difficult to swallow. But Curtis insists,"There is no way that I'm trying to be controversial just for the sake of it." Neither is he trying to be an anti-conservative polemicist like Michael Moore: "[Moore's] purpose is avowedly political. My hope is that you won't be able to tell what my politics are." For all the dizzying ideas and visual jolts and black jokes in his programmes, Curtis describes his intentions in sober, civic-minded terms. "If you go back into history and plod through it, the myth falls away. You see that these aren't terrifying new monsters. It's drawing the poison of the fear."
But whatever the reception of the series, this fear could be around for a while. It took the British government decades to dismantle the draconian laws it passed against French revolutionary infiltrators; the cold war was sustained for almost half a century without Russia invading the west, or even conclusive evidence that it ever intended to. "The archives have been opened," says the cold war historian David Caute, "but they don't bring evidence to bear on this." And the danger from Islamist terrorists, whatever its scale, is concrete. A sceptical observer of the war on terror in the British security services says: "All they need is a big bomb every 18 months to keep this going."
The war on terror already has a hold on western political culture. "After a 300-year debate between freedom of the individual and protection of society, the protection of society seems to be the only priority," says Eyal. Black agrees: "We are probably moving to a point in the UK where national security becomes the electoral question."
Some critics of this situation see our striking susceptibility during the 90s to other anxieties - the millennium bug, MMR, genetically modified food - as a sort of dress rehearsal for the war on terror. The press became accustomed to publishing scare stories and not retracting them; politicians became accustomed to responding to supposed threats rather than questioning them; the public became accustomed to the idea that some sort of apocalypse might be just around the corner. "Insecurity is the key driving concept of our times," says Durodie. "Politicians have packaged themselves as risk managers. There is also a demand from below for protection." The real reason for this insecurity, he argues, is the decay of the 20th century's political belief systems and social structures: people have been left "disconnected" and "fearful".
Yet the notion that "security politics" is the perfect instrument for every ambitious politician from Blunkett to Wolfowitz also has its weaknesses. The fears of the public, in Britain at least, are actually quite erratic: when the opinion pollsters Mori asked people what they felt was the most important political issue, the figure for "defence and foreign affairs" leapt from 2% to 60% after the attacks of September 2001, yet by January 2002 had fallen back almost to its earlier level. And then there are the twin risks that the terrors politicians warn of will either not materialise or will materialise all too brutally, and in both cases the politicians will be blamed. "This is a very rickety platform from which to build up a political career," says Eyal. He sees the war on terror as a hurried improvisation rather than some grand Straussian strategy: "In democracies, in order to galvanize the public for war, you have to make the enemy bigger, uglier and more menacing."
Afterwards, I look at a website for a well-connected American foreign policy lobbying group called the Committee on the Present Danger. The committee features in The Power of Nightmares as a vehicle for alarmist Straussian propaganda during the cold war. After the Soviet collapse, as the website puts it, "The mission of the committee was considered complete." But then the website goes on: "Today radical Islamists threaten the safety of the American people. Like the cold war, securing our freedom is a long-term struggle. The road to victory begins ... "
쨌 The Power of Nightmares starts on BBC2 at 9pm on Wednesday October 20.
Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Christino, who retired last June after 20 years in military intelligence, says that President George W Bush and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have 'wildly exaggerated' their intelligence value.
Christino's revelations, to be published this week in Guant찼namo: America's War on Human Rights, by British journalist David Rose, are supported by three further intelligence officials. Christino also disclosed that the 'screening' process in Afghanistan which determined whether detainees were sent to Guant찼namo was 'hopelessly flawed from the get-go'.
It was performed by new recruits who had almost no training, and were forced to rely on incompetent interpreters. They were 'far too poorly trained to identify real terrorists from the ordinary Taliban militia'.
According to Christino, most of the approximately 600 detainees at Guant찼namo - including four Britons - at worst had supported the Taliban in the civil war it had been fighting against the Northern Alliance before the 11 September attacks, but had had no contact with Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda.
For six months in the middle of 2003 until his retirement, Christino had regular access to material derived from Guant찼namo prisoner interrogations, serving as senior watch officer for the central Pentagon unit known as the Joint Intelligence Task Force-Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT). This made him responsible for every piece of information that went in or out of the unit, including what he describes as 'analysis of critical, time-sensitive intelligence'.
In his previous assignment in Germany, one of his roles had been to co-ordinate intelligence support to the US army in Afghanistan, at Guant찼namo, and to units responsible for transporting prisoners there.
Bush, Rumsfeld and Major General Geoffrey Miller, Guant찼namo's former commandant who is now in charge of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, have repeatedly claimed that Guant찼namo interrogations have provided 'enormously valuable intelligence,' thanks to a system of punishments, physical and mental abuse and rewards for for co-operation, introduced by Miller and approved by Rumsfeld.
In a speech in Miami, Rumsfeld claimed: 'Detaining enemy combatants... can help us prevent future acts of terrorism. It can save lives and I am convinced it can speed victory.'
However, Christino says, General Miller had never worked in intelligence before being assigned to Guant찼namo, and his system seems almost calculated to produce entirely bogus confessions.
Earlier this year, three British released detainees, Asif Iqbal, Shafiq Rasul Rhuhel Ahmed, revealed that they had all confessed to meeting bin Laden and Mohamed Atta, leader of the 11 September hijackers, at a camp in Afghanistan in 2000. All had cracked after three months isolated in solitary confinement and interrogation sessions in chains that lasted up to 12 hours daily.
Eventually, MI5 proved what they had said initially - that none had left the UK that year. Rasul had been working at a branch of Currys. The disclosures come on the eve of a House of Lords appeal on the fate of the foreign terrorist suspects held without trial in British prisons.
Tomorrow, the Lords will determine whether it was lawful for the government to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights to allow for the detention of the men at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. It is widely believed that some of the men are held on evidence obtained from prisoners at Guant찼namo. An officer from MI5 admitted under cross-examination by lawyers acting for the detainees that the British intelligence services would make use of information obtained under torture by foreign governments.
A high court appeal in August found that it was lawful for the British government to use information obtained under torture by foreign governments to avert an imminent attack, but there was no evidence that it had done so in the case of the detainees held in British jails.
Speaking at an Observer fringe meeting at the Labour party conference last week, Lord Chancellor Charlie Falconer backed the decision of the court but said it was 'an almost impossible ethical question'.
While emphasising that Britain repudiated the use of torture he said: 'We cannot condone torture, but the basis of those incarcerations is protection of other people. If we thought that 'X' was going to blow up the Tube and we thought that information was obtained by a foreign intelligence service, can we really say that we can't detain people because that information was obtained by torture?
'That's the dilemma the government is faced with. The courts have taken the view as a matter of law, that we are entitled to rely on it and I have the awful feeling that is probably the right conclusion.'
The war on terror, George Bush once declared, "will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated". But Barack Obama's administration, it appears, has ended it rather more discreetly - via email.
A message sent recently to senior Pentagon staff explains that "this administration prefers to avoid using the term Long War or Global War On Terror (Gwot) ... please pass this on to your speechwriters". Instead, they have been asked to use a bureaucratic phrase that could hardly be further from the fiery rhetoric of the months immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The global war on terror is dead; long live "overseas contingency operations".
Rumours of the imminent demise of the war on terror had been circulating for some time, and some key officials have been mentioning "overseas contingency operations" for weeks. The US defence department email, obtained by the Washington Post, seems to confirm the shift, although the Office of Management and Budget, which reviews the public testimony of administration personnel in advance, denied reports that it had ordered an across-the-board change in language.
Tony Blair was an avid supporter of Bush's terminology - "whatever the technical or legal issues about a declaration of war, the fact is we are at war with terrorism", he once said - but experts came to agree that the phrase was unhelpful.
A war on terror was too broad ever to be won, they argued, while defining not a group or ideology but a type of violence as the enemy was incoherent.
Even Donald Rumsfeld, one of the war's architects, tried in vain to persuade Bush to rebrand it the "global struggle against violent extremism", or GSave. Writing in the Guardian in January, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, said it had been a mistake that may have caused "more harm than good".
Since taking office, Obama has taken several concrete steps to shift direction, ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay and the CIA's secret prisons, and moving to end harsh interrogation practices.
"Declaring war on a method of violence was like declaring war on amphibious warfare," said Jeffrey Record, a strategy expert at the US military's Air War College in Alabama.
"Also, it suggested that there was a military solution, and that we were at war with all practitioners of terrorism, whether they threatened American interests or not. 'War' is very much overused here in the United States - on crime, drugs, poverty. Everything has to be a war. We would have been much smarter to approach terrorism as the Europeans do, as a criminal activity."
But he was not enthusiastic about the replacement term. "I'm not sure it means much of anything," he said. "And I'm not sure we're going to make any great progress by replacing one unfortunate term with another."
A major Islamist plot to kill police officers in the street has been foiled at the eleventh hour, prosecutors have said, after counter-terror raids led to the arrest of 15 suspected jihadis in Belgium and France.
In the same series of raids, two suspected terrorists were shot dead by police and another wounded in the Belgian town of Verviers, near the German border.
Authorities said they had moved to dismantle an active terror cell spanning both European countries to avert an imminent terrorist attack aimed at police officers and buildings in Belgium.
Eric van der Sypt, a Belgian federal magistrate, said 13 suspected terrorists were arrested in Belgium overnight with a further two detained in France. Nine of the suspects were held in raids in Molenbeek, two in Brussels, one in Berchem, one in Verviers, where the shootout took place, and two in France.
All three Verviers gunmen were Belgian nationals and are thought to have belonged to a homegrown cell of jihadis that recently returned from Syria. Van der Sypt added that officers were still working to formally identify the two gunmen killed in the shootout.
At the address in Verviers, police found ammunition and weapons including four Kalashnikovs, several smaller firearms and explosives. Search teams also discovered several police uniforms, walkie-talkies, radios, mobile phones and false documents and a �쐓ignificant amount of money��, Van der Sypt said.
In Molenbeek, police found ammunition, a knife, mobile phones and �쐂ifferent objects important for the investigation��.
�쏷his operation was meant to dismantle a terrorist cell and also the logistic network behind it,�� he said. �쏷his investigation for the time being has shown that these people had intentions to kill several policemen in the street and at police [stations].��
Van der Sypt said there was no link between events in Verviers and last week�셲 terror attacks in Paris but revealed that an atrocity on a similar scale had been averted at the last minute.
�쏷his operation stopped a major terrorist attack from taking place. You could say a second potential Paris has been averted,�� he said.
Meanwhile, several Jewish schools in Belgium have been closed amid warnings that they could be targets for Islamist militants, while cities across the country remain on a heightened state of alert.
Jewish schools in Brussels and Antwerp were closed and classes cancelled after officials said they were a �쐏otential target�� for radical Islamists, the Belgian news site Joods Actueel reported.
French and German authorities arrested at least 14 other people on Friday suspected of links to Islamic State (Isis), and the Gare de l�섷st train station in Paris was evacuated after a bomb scare, with Europe on high alert for further potential terrorist attacks.
A senior Belgian counter-terrorism official, who was not named, told CNN that the alleged terror cell was believed to have received instructions from Islamic State. The US news outlet quoted a separate western intelligence source as saying that the ongoing terror threat in Europe involved up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 to 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Police sources told Belgian television stations they had resolved to launch the pre-emptive operation against the terrorist suspects a fortnight ago after bugging the homes and cars of the men who were said to have recently returned from fighting in the war in Syria. The investigation concluded that a large-scale attack was imminent, targeting police stations.
Separately, on Friday morning police in Berlin arrested two men suspected of helping to recruit for Isis in Syria. The pair were taken into custody following dawn raids on 11 residences in the German capital. Police said the men were not suspected of planning attacks in Germany.
The Paris prosecutor�셲 office said 12 people were arrested in anti-terrorism raids in the region, targeting people linked to the gunman who attacked a kosher supermarket in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings and claimed ties to Isis.
The US secretary of state, John Kerry, was in Paris on Friday to meet French leaders and deliver a speech in the Paris city hall in a visit aimed at making up for the absence of senior US officials at Sunday�셲 mass rally in defiance of last week�셲 terrorist attacks.
The head of the European Union�셲 police agency, Europol, warned on Friday that the large number of radicalised Islamic extremists across Europe, their lack of command structure and growing sophistication make it �쐃xtremely difficult�� for law enforcement agencies to foil every terror attack. Rob Wainwright told the Associated Press that security and law enforcement agencies need to cooperate more closely.
He said the threat is evolving as cells controlled by a clear commander have been replaced by �쐔housands of independent actors or semi-independent terrorist suspects�� who are difficult to track.
�쏷hat�셲 the real problem I think that the intelligence community faces right now,�� he said.
The French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Friday that several French national media websites, including L�섷xpress, Le Parisien and France Inter, were experiencing problems with serving pages. The problem was traced to a common service provider, Oxalide, which said it was investigating an �쐇ncident�� with its core network, but did not yet know the cause.
A man who attempted a knife attack on soldiers guarding the Louvre Museum in Paris was shot and injured on Friday, highlighting France�셲 security and terror threat just three months before the French presidential election.
Hundreds of tourists were held in secure areas of the Louvre, one of the world�셲 most visited museums, after the man was shot five times by soldiers on patrol outside. Believed to be in his 30s, he struck at around 10am on a stairway in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping centre near the entrance to the museum. Wielding a knife, he ran at a group of soldiers on patrol shouting �쏛llahu Akbar��, or �쏥od is greatest��.
The incident, in which one soldier was slightly injured, was described by the French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, as �쐔errorist in nature��.
The suspect has not been formally identified but French police had established that the man was a 29-year-old Egyptian who arrived in France on 26 January after obtaining a tourist visa in Dubai, the Paris prosecutor said.
Police searched an apartment the man had rented in Paris and are now working to establish whether he acted alone, on impulse, or on orders from someone, prosecutor Fran챌ois Molins told a news conference. The man was wearing a black T-shirt with a death�셲 head emblem when he attacked soldiers checking bags near the museum�셲 shopping mall �쐗ith a machete in each hand��, Molins said.He struck one soldier and knocked another one to the ground. When he continued his attacks the soldier on the ground shot him in the abdomen, Molins said.
Two rucksacks carried by the suspected attacker were checked by bomb disposal specialists at the scene and were found not to contain explosives.
Michel Cadot, the Paris police prefect, said the man had headed towards soldiers �쏿rmed with a machete�� and shouting threats and �쏛llahu Akbar��. Soldiers opened fire and he was injured by gunshots, including to the stomach, and was being treated in hospital.
Cadot told reporters: �쏻e are dealing with an attack from an individual who was clearly aggressive and represented a direct threat and whose comments lead us to believe that he wished to carry out a terrorist incident.
�쏷here was also a second individual who was behaving suspiciously, who has also been detained, but for now there does not appear to be a link between that individual and the attack.��
About 1,250 visitors in the Louvre were ushered to safe areas inside the museum for a time after the incident.
�쏷here were announcements, then the security guards started running all over the place and, after a short period, they started gathering everybody up and getting them to one side of the building,�� Lance Manus, 73, from Albany, New York, told Associated Press. �쏷hey pulled the shades. They didn�셳 want anybody to sit by the windows.��
Manus, in Paris with his wife, Wendy, to mark their 50th wedding anniversary, added: �쏧 guess they were concerned that something would be coming from outside.�� He said people in the museum were calm, but some young children were crying.
A woman who worked in a restaurant nearby told AFP: �쏻e saw death coming for us, with everything that�셲 happening at the moment. We were very, very scared.��
The incident sparked fresh warnings from politicians about the terrorist and security threat, with France still reeling from a string of terrorist attacks that have killed more than 200 people over the past two years. France remains under a state of emergency following the Paris attacks of November 2015, which killed 130 people.
The French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, praised the soldiers, saying: �쏷his operation undoubtedly prevented an attack whose terrorist nature leaves little doubt.��
Donald Trump responded to the incident in a tweet that described the suspected attacker as �쏿 new radical Islamic terrorist��. �쏷ourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART US,�� the US president wrote.
The economy, immigration and security are major issues for voters in the two-round French presidential election in April and May. The country has shifted politically to the right after five years of the Socialist Hollande.
Polls show that Marine Le Pen, of the anti-immigration, far-right Front National, can reach the final round runoff. The rightwing candidate Fran챌ois Fillon, who has run a hardline campaign on security, immigration and Islam�셲 place in France, was once a favourite but is struggling for his political survival amid a scandal over whether he paid his wife and children out of public funds for allegedly fake jobs as parliamentary assistants.
The maverick independent Emmanuel Macron, who is running on a centrist ticket, is rising in the polls, and Beno챤t Hamon has seen a boost in support since he won the Socialist party primary last week.
Thousands of soldiers currently patrol cities, transport and landmarks across France as part of the Op챕ration Sentinelle military defence operation put in place following the attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Paris kosher supermarket in January 2015.
Several soldiers on patrol in France have been the target of attacks in recent years.
The Socialist MP S챕bastien Pietrasanta, who co-authored a parliamentary report on France�셲 reaction to the terrorist threat, said military personnel and police officers were a particular target because they represented the French state. He told Associated Press that France was likely to be attacked again and �쐔he worst has yet to come��. He said: �쏻e are facing a persistent threat and instability will last for at least one generation.��
The fact that the incident happened outside the Louvre could worsen the crisis for the French tourism sector, which has suffered from a fall in visitors and bookings since the wave of attacks in France since 2015. Last year, visitor numbers to the Louvre fell 15% from 2015 to 7.3 million. The most recent major attack came last July, when a Tunisian man rammed a truck through crowds watching a Bastille Day fireworks display in Nice, killing 86 people.
The Louvre, a huge former royal palace in the heart of the city, is home to the Mona Lisa and other world famous works of art as well as a shopping centre and numerous exhibition spaces.
There were a record 304 terrorism arrests in the 12 months to March, the highest number since 9/11, as the police and security services tackled an unprecedented threat level.
Home Office statisticians said the increase was driven by a 66% rise in the number of white suspects arrested, up to 113 in the 12 months to March compared with 68 the previous year.
The Home Office figures published on Thursday include12 people arrested in connection with the Westminster attack in March but exclude people detained in connection with the Manchester and London Bridge attacks.
Security service figures show the police and MI5 are carrying out 500 investigations involving a total of 3,000 suspects at any one time. There are also 20,000 former �쐓ubjects of interest�� who they say they need to keep under review.
Theresa May has promised to introduce a four-point counter-extremism plan in the Queen�셲 speech, including longer sentences for people convicted of minor offences that are terrorism-related.
The number of terrorism-related arrests was up 18% from the 12 months to March 2016 and was the highest number for any financial year since data collection started in September 2001.
The quarterly statistics also show that as of 31 March there were 186 people in prison for terrorism-related offences and domestic extremism �� an increase of 15% on the previous year.
The figures show that 108 of the 304 arrests led to a charge, with 91 suspects being charged with terrorism-related offences. One hundred were released without charge and the remainder bailed pending further action. So far, 33 of the 91 arrested on terrorism-related offences have been prosecuted and 31 found guilty. A further 53 were awaiting prosecution.
Seventy-nine terror trials were completed in the 12 months to March �� a 55% increase over the previous year and the largest number on record. They led to 68 convictions, which was also a record number for a financial year.
The statistics show that those convicted for terrorist offences are getting increasingly longer sentences. Six were given life sentences, four are serving 10 years or more, and 28 received sentences of between four and 10 years.
While arrests are at a record high, police use of stop and search, cordons and examinations at airports has fallen to record lows. Only 453 street stop and searches were carried out by the Metropolitan police on anti-terror grounds.
The number of people held at airports and ports under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 fell by 31% to 18,103, and 25 police cordons were set up in Britain in the 12 months to March �� 13 fewer than the previous financial year.
European security chiefs said on Thursday that the squeeze on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was increasing the risk of stay-at-home jihadis.The warning was contained in the annual terrorism report of the European policing agency, Europol. The report lists a total of 142 failed, foiled and completed terrorists attacks in eight European states in 2016, more than half of them in the UK.The Europol list for the UK is at odds with the figures released by the UK security services, which has reported between 2013 and the end of 2016 only a handful of attacks and 13 foiled plots.
The stadium shakes under foot as three explosions erupt at 9.20pm local time, 9.30pm and 9.53pm during a football friendly between France and Germany. The 80,000 spectators in the stadium aren�셳 given any information and many believe the explosions to be firecrackers. The players on the pitch look distracted at times, but play on.
Among the spectators are President Fran챌ois Hollande with the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Hollande takes a phone call in the stadium�셲 security control room just after 9.30pm. As the truth dawns, Hollande is rushed out of the stadium to the secure interior ministry where he convenes an emergency cabinet meeting.
The match is allowed to run its course �� France winning 2-0 �� but at the final whistle supporters congregate on the pitch because only three exits are now open. The players remain in their changing rooms.
It emerges that four people �� three of whom are terrorists wearing suicide belts, said prosecutors �� have died in the explosions, which occurred at two entrances to the stadium and outside a McDonald�셲. Reports later circulate that one of the terrorists was carrying a Syrian passport. When the fans are finally allowed out of the stadium they sing the national anthem, La Marseillaise.
About 1,500 people are packed into the small concert hall in the 11th arrondissement in eastern Paris for a sold-out concert by the Californian rock group Eagles of Death Metal when rounds of machine gunfire ring out at 9.40pm, 45 minutes into the performance. Clad in black and wielding AK-47s, three gunmen �� no older than 25 �� fire calmly, repeatedly and randomly into the densely packed audience. It is dark. The venue is filled with screams. The shooters reload three to four times. One is heard to shout �쏛llahu Akbar�� (God is greatest) as he fires.
Panicking members of the crowd try to flee and hide, scrambling over the dead bodies, running from room to room looking for a hiding place. Others climb out of windows at the back, gripping on to window sills to stop themselves falling to the road below. The assailants hold 20 hostages back. �쏧 clearly heard them say: �쁈t�셲 the fault of Hollande, it�셲 the fault of your president, he should not have intervened in Syria,�쇺�� said Pierre Janaszak, a radio presenter, who fled to hide in a toilet but could overhear the terrorists as they spoke to their terrified captives.
Those trapped inside use social media to implore the police to act. �쏧�셫 still in the Bataclan, 1st floor,�� tweets one. �쏧�셫 heavily wounded. Please police you have to launch an assault, there are still people alive here but they are killing them one by one.��
Special forces storm the venue at 12.20am as it becomes clear the terrorists are continuing to murder people inside. Within two minutes of the raid, all the gunmen are dead. Two of them blow themselves up. A third is shot. As night turns to day, the death toll stands at 89. �쏧t was a bloodbath,�� Julien Pearce, a reporter for France�셲 Europe 1 radio station, tells reporters. �쏱eople yelled, screamed and everybody lying on the floor, and it lasted for 10 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 horrific minutes where everybody was on the floor covering their head.��
At the intersection of Rue Faidherbe and Rue de Charonne, at 9.36pm, witnesses see a man get out of a car with a high-calibre weapon. Calmly he begins to fire at people enjoying an evening at La Belle Equipe, which had been fully booked on a typically busy night in this popular part of Paris. Diners are sitting outside on the terrace. Within seconds, the happy clamour of the evening ends and everyone, dead or alive, is on the ground. Screams, and the moans of the injured are all that can be heard among the gunfire. A Le Monde journalist who lives nearby recounts: �쏧 heard explosions, I went to my window. I have a direct view of the cafe. I saw a man get out of a car. He fired several times. I heard screams. Then the man got back into his car and left.��
Another witness adds: �쏧t lasted at least three minutes. Then they got back in their car and headed towards Charonne station. There was blood everywhere��. Nineteen people died here, including a plain clothes police officer.
A terrorist detonates his suicide belt inside the Voltaire restaurant at 9.40pm, on Boulevard Voltaire, a long road linking Place de la R챕publique with Place de la Nation. One person is seriouslly injured. The dead attacker is believed to have been involved in the attack at the nearby Bataclan. Photographs emerge of police searching the Comptoir Voltaire, a cafe towards the south of Boulevard Voltaire. It was on this road that world leaders marched down in a show of solidarity after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January.
At 9.25pm a gunman opens fire on Le Carillon bar in Rue Alibert, not far from Place de la R챕publique, before heading across the road to Le Petit Cambodge. It sounds like fireworks. Then the gravity of the situation dawns on diners and drinkers.
One woman looking down on the scene from her home later says she is sure that she saw two assailants and that they had travelled to the scene in cars, one of which she says had Belgian number plates. The unnamed witness told Le Monde: �쏧 saw one of the two black cars from in front of my house; I saw the front passenger who was very young, I would say he was 18 to 20.�� Another witness said shots were fired from a Ford Focus.
A young woman who arrives at the scene shortly after the attack breaks down. �쏧t was surreal, everyone was on the ground��, she told reporters. �쏯o one was moving inside the Petit Cambodge and everyone was on the ground in Carillon bar. It was very calm �� people didn�셳 understand what was going on.
�쏛 girl was being carried in the arms of a young man. She seemed to be dead.��
Fifteen are dead here and 10 are injured. A car has been left riddled with bullets and a motorbike abandoned on the ground.
Wearing tight black clothes and carrying a heavy weapon, a gunman opens fire on to the terrace of the popular pizzeria and La Bonne Biere bar at 9.32pm.
Left-handed, he fires in bursts of three or four shots. Psychotherapist Mark Colclough, a 43-year-old British-Danish dual citizen, who was 20 yards from the cafe when the attack was launched, says: �쏦e was standing in a shooting position. He had his right leg forward and he was standing with his left leg back. He was holding up to his left shoulder a long automatic machine gun �� I saw it had a magazine beneath it. Everything he was wearing was tight, either boots or shoes and the trousers were tight, the jumper he was wearing was tight, no zippers or collars. Everything was toned black.
�쏧f you think of what a combat soldier looks like, that is it �� just without the webbing. Just a man in military uniform, black jumper, black trousers, black shoes or boots and a machine gun.��
At least three diners fall dead from their chairs to the ground. The gunmen, who appears calm and does not utter a word, swivels and shoots through a car driver�셲 window before, witnesses say, walking into the cafe. There are further shots before it goes quiet. When the police arrive they fail to find the assailant. Five people have been murdered and eight more injured.
The evening after I returned from Paris, Saturday 14 November, my local Domino�셲 pizza was having one of the busiest nights of the year so far. �쏧t�셲 the terrorist attacks in Paris,�� said the man on the phone. �쏣veryone is staying in and ordering takeaway.��
This did not, at the time, tally with what my colleague Zoe Williams referred to as the �쐁lamorous bravado�� to show that you were fashionably not afraid and would carry on as normal. It�셲 all very well for Londoners to imply that they are channelling the blitz spirit; it�셲 another thing entirely to reject the temptation to hunker down with a stuffed crust and bravely take to the streets.
In fact, London has felt like a very jumpy city since mid-November, and I have no doubt that the Leytonstone attacks on Friday will add to this feeling. Friends and colleagues speak of a lurking paranoia, of panic attacks over abandoned suitcases and horrific nightmares, while the headlines scream of the possibility of dirty bombs and extra armed police. Commander Richard Walton, who leads the Met�셲 counter-terrorism command, said, following the Leytonstone attack: �쏧 would continue to urge the public to remain calm, but alert and vigilant.��
It�셲 easier said than done, this keep calm and carry on business. I wonder if we need to get away from this idea that you can control fear, and that there is a kind of moral superiority to not feeling frightened. I�셫 not saying that we should all run around like headless chickens, but let�셲 at least admit that many of us are feeling anxious, paranoid, suspicious, hypervigilant and generally freaked out.
Since the attacks in Paris, I have heard older people speak of the blitz and the IRA bombings, and how they simply went about their business, got on as normal. I wonder how much of this is a result of the sense of security offered by hindsight, of looking back and thinking: �쏧 was fine.�� Which makes me grateful for my grandmother, who told me that being bombed in Hartlepool during the second world war was terrifying and traumatising, and the friend who got caught up in 7/7 and who confessed how, a few days later, she hit the floor when she heard a loud bang. There�셲 a solidarity that comes from saying �쏧�셫 scared too�� that I find absent in the posturing of the stiff upper lip.
At the very best, fear can be somewhat managed, but it is a primitive, fight-or-flight impulse that kicks in when you feel your life is in danger (whether rationally, because of a terrorist with a gun, or irrationally, because of a rucksack left unclaimed for only a minute). When experiencing such emotions, human beings can respond differently. Some will see a ranting man waving a knife on the tube and will grab their children and run, screaming. Others will film it on their phones or tell him, �쏽ou ain�셳 no Muslim, bruv.�� No one reaction is more virtuous than the other. You deal with a threat to your life in a way that is almost entirely involuntary.
Public defiance, such as with the hashtags #jesuisenterrace and #youaintnomuslimbruv, can be inspiring because, in the aftermath of a traumatic experience, it refuses to resort to the kneejerk response of hate and intolerance. It is more powerful to say, �쏧 am frightened, but I will not allow that to make me cruel�� than it is to loftily claim immunity.
Anyone who knows anything about trauma knows that the temptation, when scared, is to lash out like a wounded animal. Just as Fran챌ois Hollande�셲 war rhetoric and immediate ordering of airstrikes struck me as the actions of a frightened man, so does the rise in Islamophobia in this country, and, in France, the unsurprising but nonetheless dispiriting success of the Front National in the regional elections. I doubt many of the people who voted FN would admit that the temptation they feel towards fascism in some ways comes from a place of fear, but this is patently the case. �쏞lose the borders, deport the Muslims, problem solved,�� they tell themselves, because their repressed fear has rendered them angry and intolerant.
Admitting to the fear many of us will be feeling is not allowing the terrorists to win �� it is a crucial part of showing our humanity. The morning after the Paris attacks the city seemed silent but stoic. It felt like a Sunday. People walked in small groups along the banks of the Seine. Some people claimed not to be frightened (a banner saying �쏮챗me pas peur�� hung at the Place de la R챕publique) but it was clear that most people were, as many of us in London are too. So let�셲 be honest about it in a way that our politicians �� with their armoured vehicles and their security staff �� will never be. Because if you fail to admit to fear, it manifests itself in strange, hateful ways. And we are better than that.
In the wake of the attack on Manchester Arena on Monday, the nation has gone through a wave of emotions - grief, revulsion, horror. Political and community leaders have urged the country to carry on as normal, and the vigils and tributes to the victims have shown the stoic side of the British character. Last night poet Tony Walsh spoke for an entire city with his emotional ode to Manchester, This is the Place.
But there�셲 also something tremendously cathartic about British humour, and following the raising of the official threat level to critical and deployment of troops on the street, social media users have rallied around the hashtag #BritishThreatLevels.
It�셲 one of those moments when the nation�셲 chatroom lifts its head up from the gloom and the bile to celebrate Britishness. And of course they focus on our core shared cultural values - tea, queues, and awkward public transport experiences.
Actually, there�셲 an awful lot of jokes about British public transport.
The British verve for politeness masking disagreement gets a look in.
And the British shyness for dealing adequately with customer service problems.
A thing that nobody wants to hear in the pub - why does this only happen when you are under time pressure to get a quick pint in?
British television and radio does not escape scrutiny.
Some of the jokes echo a Twitter bot that has been generating surreal randomised colour-coded threat levels for a year.
In a week when we can all do with a little cheering up, it�셲 nice to be reminded of the lighter-hearted uplifting side to social media. And that Twitter users still feel able to address one of the most divisive issues in the country...
Britain is well equipped to prevent terrorist atrocities similar to those seen on the continent in recent weeks, but it remains a question of �쐗hen, not if�� there is an attack, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said.
Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was hoping to offer reassurance following a number of attacks in France and Germany, but admitted that he was ultimately limited in doing so by the reality of the situation.�쏧 know that with each new outrage and especially those on our doorstep in Europe, there is a greater sense of fear that Britain will be the next victim in this wave of cruel and mindless mass murder,�� he said.
�쏧 feel and understand that fear and as the police officer in charge of preventing such an attack, [I] know that you want me to reassure you. I am afraid I cannot do that entirely.
�쏰ur threat level has been at severe for two years �� it remains there. It means an attack is highly likely. You could say it is a case of when, not if.��
Hogan-Howe was speaking in the aftermath of a series of attacks, including four claimed by Islamic State, which have raised public fears about the ability of authorities to protect them. They include the Nice attack on 14 July, when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, the murder of Father Jacques Hamel, 85, as he celebrated mass in a Normandy church last Tuesday, and attacks in W체rzburg and Ansbach in Germany.
The Met commissioner said everyone had watched such incidents with �쏿 terrifying and depressing sense of horror and dread��. However, despite people�셲 growing concerns, he said there were �쐋ots of things working in our [the UK�셲] favour��.
The relationship between MI5, MI6 and police was a �쐗orld beater��, Hogan-Howe said, which had helped prevent terror incidents since the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013.
He also pointed to the fact that the UK is an island and has strict gun controls as contributing factors, and referenced �쐔he British way of life and culture��.He said this encompassed the way the majority of officers are unarmed, which he said created a closer relationship with the communities they serve, and �쐔olerance and acceptance. Our approach to Muslims is no different because these attacks purport to be committed in the name of Islam. We don�셳 stigmatise the millions of British Muslims whose values and faith completely reject the terrorists�� litany of hate.��
Hogan-Howe outlined specific steps implemented after rampaging gunmen killed 130 people in Paris last November. The number of firearms officers has been increased by 600 to 2,800 and the number of specialists available immediately, 24/7, to tackle any terrorist threat, had risen three-fold, he said.Hogan Howe acknowledged that what he was saying would not be reassuring to some but ended on a defiant note, urging people to unite to reject the ideology espoused by terrorists. �쏻e will not become like them, we will not hate, we will not be cowed and because of this, they will never win,�� he said.
Terror attacks have scared off thousands of tourists from Paris and its top attractions, leading to a ��750m drop in the region�셲 revenues, officials have said.
Strikes and floods have also taken their toll, overshadowing the boost from the Euro 2016 football tournament and leaving the tourism industry in need of massive new investment and a rescue package, they added.
�쏧t�셲 time to realise that the tourism sector is going through an industrial disaster,�� the head of the Paris region tourist board, Fr챕d챕ric Valletoux, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Visitors to the Arc de Triomphe fell more than a third in the first half of 2016 from the same period a year earlier, the board added.
The Grand Palais museum reported a 43.9% slump and the Palace of Versailles, outside the city, just short of 20%.
�쏦otels are already laying off staff though they�셱e not saying it. This industry is on its knees and it needs relief measures now. Hoteliers need the arms to fight back,�� said Georges Panayotis, head of hotel research firm MKG group.
Hotel revenues were down 15% this summer in the Paris region, he said. Wealthier tourists were staying away in even greater numbers, with high-end hotels reporting declines of between 30-40%.
Targeted VAT cuts and other tax breaks could be part of the answer, he added.
Tourism typically provides more than 7% of France�셲 gross domestic product, at a time when the country is trying to boost its economy.
But it has had to contend with a series of disasters, from the Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people in Paris last year to the carnage when a man drove a lorry into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice last month.
�쏷he Nice attack derailed our hopes of a recovery. It�셲 a dramatic situation and there will be job cuts in the sector if things do not get better by the end of the year,�� Christian Navet, head of the UMIH-Paris-Ile-de-France hotel federation, said.
The number of Japanese visitors had almost halved in the first half of the year, according to tourist board figures. Visitors from Russia had fallen by more than a third and from China by almost a fifth.
Weak activity in France contributed to a fall in first-half operating profit for French group AccorHotels. Air France-KLM has said it expects its unit revenues to decline in July and August, partly due to the situation in France.
Only massive new investments would help to protect jobs in the sector, said Valletoux, urging the foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, to meet local tourism officials.
�쏷his is no longer the time for communication campaigns but to set up a relief plan,�� he added.
People seriously injured or maimed by terrorist attacks across the world would be granted automatic legal rights to compensation and rehabilitation under far-reaching changes to rebalance international law in favour of victims, a UN report will recommend next month.
The report, drawn up by the UN's special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, a leading British lawyer, will be welcomed by the UK government at a time when the international legal system faces criticism for doing too much to protect the rights of alleged supporters of terrorism, such as the radical cleric Abu Qatada.
Emmerson's report, details of which have been obtained by the Observer, is to be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva on 20 June and the general assembly in New York on 28 June. It is understood to have support in the Foreign Office and other UK departments, including the Home Office. The report is also thought to have backing among Council of Europe members, including Spain, which has led the international campaign to highlight the rights of victims of terrorism.
Emmerson will press the case for life insurance policies, most of which do not at present cover people killed in terrorist attacks, to pay up to bereaved next of kin. The proposals would also affect travel insurance policies that cover medical and other care for those killed or injured through terrorism while on holiday.
Groups set up to support victims and the bereaved have welcomed the progress that is being made.
The report comes after a four-year campaign by the family of Mumbai bomb victim Will Pike, 31, who was left disabled. Along with other British victims of the Mumbai attacks �� and of those in Bali, Turkey and Egypt �� Pike was left without financial help to cope with his injuries.
Few states outside western Europe have satisfactory compensation systems, including the US, although Washington did set up a special scheme to compensate 9/11 victims.
The report will say that full and effective reparation should include, as appropriate, restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.
It also says states should consider whether to legislate to prohibit the sale or marketing of life assurance policies that contain an exclusion for deaths that result from acts of terrorism.
In the UK, victims of terrorism can apply for compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Payments range from 짙1,000 to 짙500,000. However, while the UK has a system in place, survivors of the 7/7 attacks have complained of long delays.
In April this year, the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, set out details under which the UK government would make ex gratia payments to victims of terrorist incidents which take place outside the UK. These range from payments for minor wounds such as tendon injuries (짙2,500) to quadriplegia, which would qualify for a payment of 짙250,000.
The Emmerson report, if accepted, would have the effect of obliging all UN states to adopt a uniform set of standards, establishing more firmly in international law the principle that terrorist acts amount to violations of the human rights of the victims, irrespective of the question of direct or indirect state responsibility.
Victims and their families would also be granted a right to protection against press intrusion. Following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington many families complained of media intrusion, particularly in the immediate aftermath. Victims of terrorism would include those who have been killed or who have suffered serious physical or psychological injury; next-of-kin or dependants of a direct victim and innocent individuals who have been killed or suffered serious injury indirectly attributable to an act of terrorism.
A foreign office spokesperson said: "We agree that the rights of victims of terrorism are fundamentally important. The UK has a good track record domestically for protecting the rights of victims. The way that work to further this might be taken forward internationally needs careful consideration if it is to be effective and implemented by all states. It will be important that proposals are evidence-based and that there are opportunities for thorough consultation with states and civil society."
The so-called war on terror is nearly 13 years old, but which rational human being will be cheering its success? We�셶e had crackdowns on civil liberties across the world, tabloid-fanned generalisations about Muslims and, of course, military interventions whose consequences have ranged from the disastrous to the catastrophic. And where have we ended up? Wars that Britons believe have made them less safe; jihadists too extreme even for al-Qaida�셲 tastes running amok in Iraq and Syria; and nations like Libya succumbing to Islamist militias. There are failures, and then there are calamities.
But as the British government ramps up the terror alert to �쐓evere�� and yet more anti-terror legislation is proposed, some reflection after 13 years of disaster is surely needed. One element has been missing, and that is the west�셲 relationship with Middle Eastern dictatorships that have played a pernicious role in the rise of Islamist fundamentalist terrorism. And no wonder: the west is militarily, economically and diplomatically allied with these often brutal regimes, and our media all too often reflects the foreign policy objectives of our governments.
Take Qatar. There is evidence that, as the US magazine The Atlantic puts it, �쏲atar�셲 military and economic largesse has made its way to Jabhat al-Nusra��, an al-Qaida group operating in Syria. Less than two weeks ago, Germany�셲 development minister, Gerd Mueller, was slapped down after pointing the finger at Qatar for funding Islamic State (Isis).
While there is no evidence to suggest Qatar�셲 regime is directly funding Isis, powerful private individuals within the state certainly are, and arms intended for other jihadi groups are likely to have fallen into their hands. According to a secret memo signed by Hillary Clinton, released by Wikileaks, Qatar has the worst record of counter-terrorism cooperation with the US.
And yet, where are the western demands for Qatar to stop funding international terrorism or being complicit in the rise of jihadi groups? Instead, Britain arms Qatar�셲 dictatorship, selling it millions of pounds worth of weaponry including �쐁rowd-control ammunition�� and missile parts. There are other reasons for Britain to keep stumm, too. Qatar owns lucrative chunks of Britain such as the Shard, a big portion of Sainsbury�셲 and a slice of the London Stock Exchange.
Then there�셲 Kuwait, slammed by Amnesty International for curtailing freedom of expression, beating and torturing demonstrators and discriminating against women. Hundreds of millions have been channelled by wealthy Kuwaitis to Syria, again ending up with groups like Jabhat al-Nusra.
Kuwait has refused to ban the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society, a supposed charity designated by the US Treasury as an al-Qaida bankroller. David Cohen, the US Treasury�셲 undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, has even described Kuwait as the �쐃picentre of fundraising for terrorist groups in Syria��. As Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, an associate fellow at Chatham House, told me: �쏦igh profile Kuwaiti clerics were quite openly supporting groups like al-Nusra, using TV programmes in Kuwait to grandstand on it.�� All of this is helped by lax laws on financing and money laundering, he says.
But don�셳 expect any concerted action from the British government. Kuwait is �쏿n important British ally in the region��, as the British government officially puts it. Tony Blair has become the must-have accessory of every self-respecting dictator, ranging from Kazakhstan to Egypt; Kuwait was Tony Blair Associates�� first client in a deal worth 짙27m. Britain has approved hundreds of arms licences to Kuwait since 2003, recently including military software and anti-riot shields.
And then, of course, there is the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia. Much of the world was rightly repulsed when Isis beheaded the courageous journalist James Foley. Note, then, that Saudi Arabia has beheaded 22 people since 4혻August. Among the �쐁rimes�� that are punished with beheading are sorcery and drug trafficking.
Around 2,000 people have been killed since 1985, their decapitated corpses often left in public squares as a warning. According to Amnesty International, the death penalty �쐇s so far removed from any kind of legal parameters that it is almost hard to believe��, with the use of torture to extract confessions commonplace. Shia Muslims are discriminated against and women are deprived of basic rights, having to seek permission from a man before they can even travel or take up paid work.
Even talking about atheism has been made a terrorist offence and in 2012, 25-year-old Hamza Kashgari was jailed for 20 months for tweeting about the prophet Muhammad. Here are the fruits of the pact between an opulent monarchy and a fanatical clergy.
This human rights abusing regime is deeply complicit in the rise of Islamist extremism too. Following the Soviet invasion, the export of the fundamentalist Saudi interpretation of Islam �� Wahhabism �� fused with Afghan Pashtun tribal code and helped to form the Taliban. The Saudi monarchy would end up suffering from blowback as al-Qaida eventually turned against the kingdom.
Chatham House professor Paul Stevens says: �쏤or a long time, there was an unwritten agreement �� whereby al-Qaida�셲 presence was tolerated in Saudi Arabia, but don�셳 piss inside the tent, piss outside.�� Coates Ulrichsen warns that Saudi policy on Syria could be �쏛fghanistan on steroids��, as elements of the regime have turned a blind eye to where funding for anti-Assad rebels ends up.
Although Saudi Arabia has given $100m (짙60m) to the UN anti-terror programme and the country�셲 grand mufti has denounced Isis as �쐃nemy number one��, radical Salafists across the Middle East receive ideological and material backing from within the kingdom. According to Clinton�셲 leaked memo, Saudi donors constituted �쐔he most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide��.
But again, don�셳 expect Britain to act.혻Our alliance with the regime dates back to 1915, and Saudi Arabia is the British arms industry�셲 biggest market, receiving 짙1.6bn of military exports. There are now more than 200 joint ventures between UK and Saudi companies worth $17.5bn.
So much rhetoric about terrorism; so many calls to act. Yet Britain�셲 foreign policy demonstrates how empty such words are. Our allies are up to their necks in complicity with terrorism, but as long as there is money to be made and weapons to sell, our rulers�� lips will remain stubbornly sealed.
Jeremy Corbyn will return to campaigning for the general election on Friday morning after the pause following the Manchester bombing. He plans to give a speech criticising police cuts and drawing a link between British foreign policy and terror attacks.
With less than a fortnight until polling day, the Labour leader will tell an audience in London that a government led by his party would provide more resources for law enforcement and the NHS to ensure people were �쐍ot protected and cared for on the cheap��.
The longtime peace campaigner and former chair of the Stop the War coalition will also argue that it is the responsibility of government to ensure that �쐎ur foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country��.
Corbyn will say: �쏮any experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services, have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home.
�쏷hat assessment in no way reduces the guilt of those who attack our children. Those terrorists will forever be reviled and held to account for their actions. But an informed understanding of the causes of terrorism is an essential part of an effective response that will protect the security of our people that fights rather than fuels terrorism.��
He will argue that the government should admit the �쐗ar on terror�� had failed and rethink its approach.
Ben Wallace, a Conservative security minister, criticised Corbyn�셲 comments as �쐁rass and appallingly timed�� and defended the government�셲 record on security spending. �쏦e needs to get his history book out,�� Wallace told BBC Radio 4�셲 Today programme. �쏷hese people hate our values, not our foreign policy.��
Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, also criticised Corbyn�셲 intervention: �쏛 few days ago, a young man built a bomb, walked into a pop concert and deliberately slaughtered children. Our children. Families are grieving. A community is in shock. Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to use that grotesque act to make a political point.��
Farron added: �쏧 don�셳 agree with what he says, but I disagree even more that now is the time to say it. That�셲 not leadership, it�셲 putting politics before people at a time of tragedy.��
The Labour leader was defended by Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary. He said: �쏻hat Jeremy [Corbyn] is saying is that we need to profoundly reassess the way in which there are linkages. What we did there was we made a military intervention and then withdrew. That country has been in chaos. There was no planning for what might happen afterwards. Now that country has women being sold in slave markets in its cities. That country is in chaos.
�쏮ilitary intervention has gone in hard then lost its way. You can look back to Iraq, Afghanistan and see that the stabilisation of a country is so important.��
Corbyn and his close aides have long held the view that British foreign policy, including the involvement of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he vehemently opposed, has exacerbated the risk of terrorist attacks by destabilising the Middle East and fuelling suspicion of the west.
In a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in May, he suggested a Labour government would seek to rely on a �쐔riple commitment�� to defence, development and diplomacy, to protect Britain�셲 interests, rather than a �쐀omb first, talk later�� mentality.
After the terror attack on Manchester, the Conservatives are likely to seize on the intervention as evidence that Labour would be soft on terrorism.
But Corbyn will highlight Labour�셲 pledge to put 20,000 more police officers on the streets, saying: �쏬abour will reverse the cuts to our emergency services and police. Once again in Manchester, they have proved to be the best of us. Austerity has to stop at the A&E ward and at the police station door. We cannot be protected and cared for on the cheap.��
Many election candidates across the country resumed low-key campaigning, delivering leaflets and knocking on doors on Thursday, after a minute�셲 silence was observed in the morning to honour the victims of Monday�셲 deadly attack.
Corbyn�셲 speech will mark the full resumption of national campaigning. He will say: �쏯o government can prevent every terrorist attack. If an individual is determined enough and callous enough, sometimes they will get through.
�쏝ut the responsibility of government is to minimise that chance �� to ensure the police have the resources they need, that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country and that at home we never surrender the freedoms we have won and that terrorists are so determined to take away.��
He will also talk about the �쏝ritish values�� seen in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack, saying: �쏧 want the solidarity, humanity and compassion that we have seen on the streets of Manchester this week to be the values that guide our government. There can be no love of country if there is neglect or disregard for its people.��
Corbyn and a small group of aides have planned a �쐏hased return�� to electioneering after the pause, which was agreed to by the major parties.
Andrew Murray, another former Stop the War chair and former communist, who was recently drafted in to Labour HQ to help with the campaign, shares many of Corbyn�셲 views, regarding Britain�셲 involvement in Middle East conflicts, including in Syria, as �쐗estern imperialism��.
Labour had appeared to be eating into Theresa May�셲 poll lead last weekend as the Conservatives struggled to explain the social care policy that was the centrepiece of their manifesto.
The prime minister executed an abrupt U-turn on Monday, announcing that she would consult on introducing a cap on total costs, so older people did not face unlimited liability. At an awkward press conference in Wrexham, she repeatedly insisted �쐍othing has changed�� and played down accusations that the Tories would impose a so-called dementia tax.
But May halted the campaign to take direct control of the aftermath of Monday night�셲 attack, chairing meetings of the Cobra emergency committee and delivering a defiant speech in Downing Street insisting British values would prevail over terrorism. She will go to Taormina in Italy on Friday to attend a summit of the G7 industrialised states, but other ministers will return to campaigning.
There are lots of ways to be a disaffected, disenfranchised young man. You can spout anonymous abuse online. You can shoot up a school. You can bomb abortion clinics in the name of being pro-life. You can kill black people peacefully praying at church, in the name of white supremacy. You can murder teenagers singing joyfully along at a pop concert, in the name of Isis and Allah.
What you are called, when you do those things, varies. Sometimes you�셱e a criminal. Sometimes you�셱e a terrorist. Sometimes you�셱e a mental health statistic. How you are treated, when you do those things, varies. Sometimes you�셱e headline news around the world for days; you make an ignominious mark on the history books. Sometimes you�셱e a few paragraphs in the local papers, and barely make it into the national press.
There are a few key variables which determine what you are called and how you are treated when you commit a deadly act designed to cause widespread fear. Namely: how many people you killed; where you killed them; whether you shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� as you killed them and the colour of your skin. The whiter your skin, it seems, the more likely you are to be classified as a criminal rather than a terrorist.
In 2015, for example, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white supremacist, shot dead nine African American worshippers in a church in South Carolina. He was convicted of 33 federal charges, including murder and hate crimes, but he was not convicted of terrorism. A case of one man�셲 white supremacist is another man�셲 terrorist is another man�셲 �쐓mart, quiet child who ... just fell off the grid somehow��.
Which takes us to Devon Arthurs, an 18-year-old white supremacist turned Islamist. Arthurs is a fascinating, if macabre, case study in the way we talk about terrorism, and the arbitrary lines that often seem to get drawn between ideology and pathology.
Last Friday, Arthurs allegedly held three people at gunpoint at a Tampa smoke shop. After being arrested he apparently exclaimed �쏛llah Mohammed!�� and told police: �쏷his wouldn�셳 have had to happen if your country didn�셳 bomb my country.�� Arthurs was born in Florida.
As it turns out, the night was just warming up. Arthurs then directed the police to a nearby apartment complex where they found two of his roommates. They were dead. According to a police report, Arthurs had stabbed his former friends because they were neo-Nazis who �쐂isrespected�� his new religion. Also, he thought they were planning to commit acts of domestic terrorism.
The FBI and Tampa police department found bombmaking equipment believed to belong to Brandon Russell, a third roommate. Russell is a Florida national guardsman and, as well as reportedly keeping explosives in his garage, kept a photo of the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people, in his bedroom. He was arrested on Sunday and charged with �쐏ossessing an unregistered destructive device and unlawful storage of explosive material��.
According a recent report, A Dark and Constant Rage, from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), rightwing extremists have been responsible for planning at least 150 acts of terror in the United States over the past 25 years. They�셶e killed 255 people in these attacks and injured 600 more. White supremacists and anti-government extremists are the biggest subset of rightwing extremists (which also includes groups such as anti-abortionists and anti-immigrant extremists) and are responsible for 85% of these incidents.
However, as the ADL points out, while �쐒ightwing extremists have been one of the largest and most consistent sources of domestic terror incidents in the United States for many years��, this fact �쐆as not gotten the attention it deserves.�� What�셲 more, �쐇t has garnered far less notice than �� Islamic terrorism��.
Can you imagine how much more press Brandon Russell�셲 basement full of explosives would have received if it had belonged to a man called Mohammed with a picture of a 9/11 bomber in his bedroom?
Rightwing terrorism doesn�셳 just get less media attention than Islamist terrorism �� it gets less attention in policy. As the ADL report notes, the US still doesn�셳 have a federal domestic terrorism statute and �쐄ederal spending on training law enforcement on issues such as rightwing violence and terrorism is extremely low��. This is clearly ridiculous.
If the statistics don�셳 show how ridiculous it is, Devon Arthurs, a white supremacist turned Islamist who allegedly murdered his former neo-Nazi friends thinking they were about to commit acts of domestic terrorism, does.
Arthurs is a timely reminder that the road to extremist violence can take many paths but it often starts from the same place: notions of threatened masculinity and feelings of worthlessness and humiliation.
Arthur�셲 metamorphosis from a neo-Nazi to an Islamist should remind us to eschew the narrative of a Clash of Civilizations that is often pressed on us and, instead, interrogate more universal sources of anger.
At least 95 people have been killed and around 250 wounded in the deadliest terror attack in Turkey�셲 history after two explosions targeted a peace rally in the centre of the capital.Twin explosions outside Ankara�셲 main train station on Saturday morning targeted hundreds of people who had gathered to protest against violence between authorities and the Kurdish militant group, the PKK.
Turkish government officials said the explosions were a terrorist attack carried out by suicide bombers but no group immediately claimed responsibility. Turkey�셲 prime minister, Ahmet Davuto휓lu, called emergency meetings with government officials and security chiefs.
Early statements put the death toll at 86, but on Saturday evening both the pro-Kurdish HDP party and the Turkish Medical Association revised the estimate to at least 97, while the wounded numbered 245 or more.
Immediately after the attack at least 20 bodies could be seen covered by bloodstained flags on the road. Witnesses said the blasts were seconds apart shortly after 10am and were so powerful they rocked nearby high-rise buildings.
Turkey awoke in grief on Sunday. �쏻e are in mourning for peace,�� said the front-page headline in the secularist Cumhuriyet newspaper as three days of national mourning declared by the prime minister got under way.
Other papers voiced public anger over the attack. �쏶cum attacked in Ankara,�� said the Haberturk newspaper, while the pro-government Star declared: �쏷he goal is to divide the nation.��
One of the bombers was identified as a male aged between 25-30 after analysing bodies at the scene and taking fingerprints, the pro-government Yeni Safak said.
Davutoglu, exposing a mosaic of domestic political perils, said Islamic State, Kurdish or far-leftist militants could have carried out the bombing.
His office named 52 of the victims overnight and said autopsies were continuing. It said 246 wounded people were still being treated, 48 of them in intensive care.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an, condemned the double bombing, saying the attack targeted the country�셲 unity and peace. Erdo휓an said: �쏧 strongly condemn this heinous attack on our unity and our country�셲 peace. No matter what its origin, aim or name, we are against any form of terrorist act or terrorist organisation. We are obliged to be against it together.��
The president said there was no distinction between the terrorist attack in Ankara, which came just three weeks ahead of parliamentary elections, and the ones targeting Turkish soldiers and police.
�쏬ike other acts of terror, the attack at the Ankara train station is taking aim at our unity, brotherhood and future,�� he added. �쏷he solidarity and determination we are going to display in the face of this attack will be the biggest and the most meaningful response to the terror.��
Erdo휓an urged people to be �쏿gainst, not on the side of terror�� and said the perpetrators of Saturday�셲 attack would be found in the shortest time and delivered to justice.
Some witnesses said ambulances could not immediately reach the scene of the attack, and that police obstructed the quick evacuation of the wounded from the square. Turkish MP Sirri S체reyya 횜nder also claimed a suspicious vehicle and another suspicious package had been found and that bomb-disposal experts had been called to the scene.
In the aftermath of the attack those involved in the peace march tended to the wounded, as hundreds of stunned people wandered around the streets. Bodies lay in two circles around 20m apart where the explosions had taken place.
The prime minister�셲 office banned media coverage of the attack, citing �쐓ecurity reasons��, though several local media groups said they would ignore the ministry�셲 orders. Access to social media services, such as Twitter, was temporarily only possible through VPN in Turkey.
Veysel Eroglu, minister for forestry and water, attempted to put the blame on the organisers of the peace rally. �쏰ur people need to be careful of such provocateurs that organise terrorist demonstrations in order to incite discord in social harmony,�� he said.
The HDP, one of the groups organising the peace rally, said in a statement that it had specifically been targeted. Several HDP members and parliamentary candidates are among the victims of the attack.
Selahattin Demirta힊, co-chair of the HDP party, said: �쏷his attack is not targeting our state and national unity, it is perpetrated by the state against the people. We are witnessing a massacre here. A cruel and barbarian attack was carried out. The death toll is high.�� Demirtas added that he did not expect that those responsible for the bombings would be brought to justice.
Asked at a press conference if he had considered resigning over the Ankara attack, interior minister Selami Altinok denied that there had been failures in security preparations for the planned peace rally. Only hours after the Ankara bomb attacks, the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire and called on its fighters to halt all guerrilla attacks in Turkey, according to the Firat news agency.
The US state department strongly condemned what it called a heinous attack, while the US embassy in Ankara said on Twitter: �쏛ll of us must stand united against terror.�� President Barack Obama later offered his condolences to the Turkish president in a phone call. He reportedly affirmed that the US would �쐓tand with Turkey and its people in the fight against terrorism and other security challenges in the region��.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, expressed �쐓adness and dismay�� over the attacks, while Russia�셲 Vladimir Putin offered condolences to Erdogan.
In Istanbul an estimated 10,000 people marched down the main central avenue to denounce the attacks. Thousands also took to the streets in solidarity in Paris, Strasbourg and Marseille in France, as well as in Zurich in Switzerland.
The explosion will spark significant security concerns ahead of the parliamentary elections and fuel fear over violent outbreaks in the region. A rally for the pro-Kurdish HDP party was bombed in June, ahead of last year�셲 general election, but this is the deadliest single attack on the country�셲 soil.
Turkey has been in a heightened state of alert since starting a �쐓ynchronised war on terror�� in July, including airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Syria and PKK bases in northern Iraq. It has also rounded up hundreds of suspected militants at home.
Designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the European Union, the PKK launched a separatist insurgency in 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.
The state launched peace talks with the PKK�셲 jailed leader in 2012 and the latest in a series of ceasefires had been holding until the violence flared again in July.

Theresa May will attempt to reassert control over the political agenda by agreeing a new counter-terror strategy with the French president, vowing to fine tech companies such as Facebook and Google if they do not step up efforts to combat online radicalisation.
The prime minister and Emmanuel Macron will launch a joint campaign on Tuesday to tackle online radicalisation, a personal priority of the prime minister from her time as home secretary and a comfortable agenda for the pair to agree upon before Brexit negotiations begin next week.
In particular, the two say they intend to create a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove inflammatory content, which could include penalties such as fines.
The prime minister�셲 first visit to the 횋lys챕e Palace since Macron�셲 election comes at a time of starkly contrasting fortunes for the two �� the French president�셲 new party, La R챕publique En Marche, topped the polls in Sunday�셲 first round of legislative elections, while the Conservatives lost their majority in the snap general election.
May and Macron will meet at the 횋lys챕e Palace on Tuesday afternoon before a working dinner and will then attend the England v France football friendly at the Stade de France in the evening.
One official said the two leaders attending the match would be a chance to �쐁elebrate our friendship and solidarity�� and remember the victims of the Manchester and London attacks. There will be a minute�셲 silence before kick-off.
At the bilateral talks in Paris, May and Macron are expected to agree ways in which France and the UK can develop tools with tech companies to stop online extremism, with No 10 highlighting how both countries have been hit recently by terror attacks in London, Manchester, Nice and Paris.
The home secretary, Amber Rudd, and Macron�셲 new interior minister, G챕rard Collomb, will meet in the coming days to hammer out the details of the policy initiative. No 10 said the talks would also advance the establishment of an industry-led forum to develop shared technical and policy solutions to the problem, as agreed by world leaders at last month�셲 G7 summit in Italy.
May said the need to tackle to radicalisation online was a priority for both countries. �쏷he counter-terrorism cooperation between British and French intelligence agencies is already strong, but President Macron and I agree that more should be done to tackle the terrorist threat online,�� she said. �쏧n the UK we are already working with social media companies to halt the spread of extremist material and poisonous propaganda that is warping young minds. We are united in our total condemnation of terrorism and our commitment to stamp out this evil.��
Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee, welcomed the proposed legislation. �쏶ocial media companies like YouTube have been getting away with a dangerous and irresponsible approach to extremism for too long. Still today YouTube is showing illegal propaganda videos for banned jihadi and neo-Nazi extremists,�� she said.
�쏷hey have a disgraceful disregard for the law. The cross-party home affairs select committee called for a system of fines and stronger legislation. So if that is what the British and French governments are working on now, that is really welcome. They need to make rapid progress, because online radicalisation is a very serious threat, and this problem has been growing for a long time.��
An Elys챕e official said Macron and May�셲 working dinner would focus on security issues �쐔o look at the possibilities for deepening our cooperation on counter-terrorism, both bilaterally and on a European basis��.
Regulating extremist content online featured heavily in May�셲 response to the terror attacks at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester and on London Bridge, which both occurred during the general election campaign.
The Tory manifesto outlined measures to push internet companies further on their commitment to identify and remove terrorist propaganda, and stop terrorists communicating online, including a pledge to examine how to tackle encrypted communications between extremists.
In a speech after the London attack, in which eight people were killed when three attackers knocked down pedestrians in a van and stabbed people in Borough Market, May vowed to clamp down on internet hatred. She accused big internet companies of giving terrorist ideology �쐔he safe space it needs to breed�� online.�쏷hat is precisely what the internet and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide,�� she said. �쏻e need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning.��
However, her plan for further regulation of the internet was criticised by some campaigners, including the Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, who said further state censorship was not the answer.
In the days after the terror attack in Manchester, mainstream media and social media provided a constant flow of information. With so much to read and digest, how did young people in the UK navigate the coverage, and how did it help them to make sense of what happened �� an attack on a music concert packed with young people having fun?
In the 24 hours after the attack, 307,900 tweets were posted with the hashtag #ManchesterAttack �� and this was just one of the many hashtags being used on the platform. Despite the huge amount of information, young people who responded to a Guardian callout said social media proved much more useful than mainstream news, which they say was slow and repetitive. Respondents said they felt much more knowledgable and up-to-date than older people they knew.
For those living in Manchester, social media helped them to feel more connected to their local community. And although respondents said they were aware of negative posts, fake news and Islamophobic content, they were mostly able to exclude it by curating who they followed.
We spoke to young people about their thoughts on the coverage. Was there too much information? How did it make them feel? And was it what they expected?
The people of Manchester seem to have rallied together and shown that love will always prevail in the shadow of hatred. My sister, who was at the concert and being only 14 years old, cannot understand how one of the best nights of her life became one of the most terrifying. We live on a small island, largely free from high-profile crime.
As news of the attack broke I was constantly checking Twitter for updates as well as watching BBC News and occasionally going through Facebook, as I knew many friends I had met in Leeds would have been at the concert.
Having seen articles shared on social media from some newspapers, they are feeding into the uneducated ideologies they know their readership will eat up.
Facebook updates from friends in Manchester were very helpful as they had access to facts before the news stations, as did my parents who informed me it was a bomb as they were helping a victim in a hotel. Thanks to BBC News coverage I was also able to inform my parents, extremely close to Cathedral Gardens in a hotel, not to worry if they heard a further explosion.
I am thankful to be surrounded by like-minded people on social media. The emphasis was on the brutality of the attack, the missing people and mourning the loss of life. The only time I have seen anything disrespectful or Islamaphobic has been when I have gone to videos or tweets from people I don�셳 actively follow. It is easy for me to say that the reaction has been positive. But I know it hasn�셳 been completely.
I don�셳 think there was too much coverage, but on the mainstream news it was so repetitive and didn�셳 seem to have new information that I hadn�셳 seen before. I�셶e spoken to my mum about it and the things I mention about the event she didn�셳 know. I�셶e been using Twitter to get my information and she�셲 been using news shows. This to me suggests the shows aren�셳 as up to date with it as they should be.
I think the coverage on Twitter was the best since the majority of tweets where from people who had actually experienced the event. There was quite a lot of positive tweets, with people making hashtags to commemorate those who had died, and to find ones who were still missing. There were some negative comments from people who were just being insensitive about the whole situation but it was mainly positive.
I didn�셳 see much coverage on Instagram but I noticed people changing their profile pictures to Ariana�셲 bunny ear symbol. Snapchat mainly covered news I had already seen on Twitter and Facebook and, in my opinion, wasn�셳 as up to date.
The coverage has made me more worried about terrorism, since there have been so many incidents. But it has also made me realise how united Britain is, with people offering rooms, free taxi rides, food and donating blood and money. Deploying the police all over the country makes me relax a bit more. However, I believe they should spread them out more. Being from a small town, we haven�셳 really got many guards around our area, which is a bit worrying.
Going through social media and seeing people sharing posts about missing children, offering free rides or safe places to those nearby, fundraising pages for the victims�� families �� I�셶e never witnessed this kind of support network before and it is heartening to see it in the wake of something so awful.
The attack shocked all of us. Going into school, it all felt a bit surreal. The sad truth is that we�셶e grown accustomed to hearing about terrorist attacks, or innocent people killed in war, but with Manchester being our home town this really affected us all on some level.
The social media reaction, with people reaching out to help their fellow Mancunians, has shown that there really is a sense of community here and a desire to help people. It is heartening to see when something so devastating has happened.
It�셲 just so awful to think about how many families have had people torn away from them just because they attended a music concert. I�셶e noticed how people are making an effort to be kinder and more tolerant. Manchester is home to many different people and they come together when it counts.
I am completely disillusioned with the media response. This is especially true for social media. Not only is it completely sick to share fake news, it also highlights some bizarre behaviour. When an event like this happens, I cannot stand people who make a point of having a sense of humour about these things. I imagine they would find it hard to crack a joke if it had directly affected them. Which is the fact of the matter with these acts. It could happen to anyone.
The reprise of social media attention-seekers such as Katie Hopkins, who feeds on a devastating event like this so she can kick up a fuss about something else. Also, Eamonn Holmes�� strange tweet accusing the police of not doing enough. Why do we employ these people on mainstream TV?
In times like these, it makes you realise the amazing broadcasting of the BBC. Impartial and factual, it is the backbone of getting the facts out there during a media frenzy which surrounds these kinds of events. A Newsround article aimed at children was a particular example of how amazing the BBC is.
I think the show of support for the victims on social media is very encouraging, but there are also many people using social media to spread hatred and ignorance, which is only making this worse. There are people criticising Ariana Grande and saying this is her fault when it so clearly isn�셳. There are also people trying to use this attack to spread Islamaphobia, which is completely unjustified. Although there are many more people saying the opposite, the voices of hatred often shout a lot louder.
For a lot of us, concerts are a safe space where we get to interact with some of our greatest role models and meet other young people with the same experiences. It�셲 really upsetting to see something so special ripped away from people who were just like me. It makes this attack feel a lot more personal than previous ones, especially as it was clearly much more deliberate than the attack in Westminster.
I can�셳 help but feel that isn�셳 just an attack on young people and our society, but also on young women.
The coverage on social media was very informative by offering different insights to mainstream media such as televised news. I think Twitter played the biggest part in this as it helped people with their search for missing friends and family, which was shared by complete strangers, which made a really positive response from those on the internet.
One of the best things I have seen is definitely the massive amount of positivity towards the homeless man who helped others and how it has actually changes his life. That said, there was a lot of negative comments and insensitive behaviour from some individuals, along with fake accounts of the missing people.
I wouldn�셳 say there is too much coverage as it is constantly being updated on news apps and social media. But televised news was very repetitive and it seemed that those mainly watching the news knew less. And some papers have used headers that are just completely inappropriate.
I don�셳 necessarily feel more worried now but terrorism seems more real. Usually attacks are in the big cities like London, you don�셳 really expect it to be so close to where you live.
I have spoken to both my parents and teachers about this and they seem to be rather shocked about the amount I actually know from social media alone.
Of all France�셲 great cities, none can rival Nice when it comes to conjuring up images of the sun-kissed good life.
With a stunning marina that draws in the wealthy yachting crowd, France�셲 fifth largest city enjoys an enviable position on the French Riviera not far from the millionaires�� playground of Monte Carlo and beautiful Juan-les-Pins, where Picasso and F Scott Fitzgerald held court. If, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, Paris is where good Americans go when they die, Nice must be reserved for the truly sainted.
But now the city�셲 reputation as an all-year-round holiday spot, attractive to both the easyJet set and boat-owning millionaires, is under threat. Away from its beaches, palm trees and swish hotels, the C척te d�섲zur has earned itself a new, unwelcome reputation: as a breeding ground for jihadis.
Disaffected youths in the region, many of them the children of Tunisian, Moroccan and Algerian immigrants, are drawn to the extreme Salafi strain of Islam promoted by charismatic preachers who denounce western decadence. After Paris, the Alpes-Maritimes area, of which Nice is the capital, is the leading hotspot for Islamist radicalisation in France. Analysis by the Economist suggests that the department has recorded 522 alerts about newly radicalised individuals.
Tensions in Nice have been threatening to spill over. In February a man attacked three soldiers with a knife outside a Jewish community centre, while two years ago the former mayor was accused of antagonising local Muslims. There have also been concerns about the opening of a new Salafi mosque. Now one unpalatable question facing Nice is whether Thursday�셲 atrocity will have a lasting impact on its image. In the short term, the city has had little choice but to forge a new, more subdued path for itself.
The Nice jazz festival, due to start on Saturday and featuring acts such as Massive Attack, has been cancelled. The singer Rihanna called off her concert there, too. But many tourists who were in the city when the attack happened have taken to social media, pledging that they will continue with their vacations. Those who have booked holidays on the C척te d�섲zur are also unlikely to change their plans, experts believe.
�쏰f those who have already booked their holidays, I think very few will cancel,�� says Frank Brehany, consumer director of Holiday Travel Watch, the holiday watchdog. �쏷his is partly because they will lose their money, but also because they will be reassured by the reaction of the French government in extending the national state of emergency.��
The extension will see a visible security presence, both in Nice and across France, continued for another three months. This will entail more police and soldiers on the streets, a graphic reminder to Britons, who make 17 million visits to France each year, that the country, according to the Foreign Office, faces a �쐆igh threat from terrorism��.
�쏛ttacks could be indiscriminate,�� the Foreign Office says. �쏡ue to continuing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as Isil), the French government has warned the public to be extra vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures.��
Visitors are being encouraged to download the free Saip smartphone app that alerts users, in French and English, about potential security incidents. But the app reportedly failed during the Bastille Day attack.
Brehany believes Nice will bounce back. �쏛s horrific as the Nice attack was, if you measure it against, say, Paris or Brussels, where there were multi-attacks, and both cities experienced lockdowns, there was a huge, immediate impact on tourism to both cities,�� he says. �쏝ut I was in Brussels recently and it was evident the changes they had made to security. I was in Paris a couple of weeks ago in the midst of the Euros [football championship] and you wouldn�셳 have thought there was any difference; there were huge crowds in the Gare du Nord. In the long term Nice will recover just as Paris and Brussels have done.��
Nevertheless Brehany says the Nice attack was a wake-up call for Europe�셲 tourist industry. �쏛fter Paris everyone came out with the phrase �쁶e must not give in to terror��, but I don�셳 know what that means,�� he says.
�쏻e really need to have a rethink about safety at our train stations, airports, ferry terminals and public spaces. One of the concerns I have is about the security of popular beaches following what happened in Tunisia last year.
�쏽ou cannot just simply offer a mantra in the hope that it will go away. You need to devise and, yes, spend money on the mechanics that make public spaces safe. You are not going to get rid of this thing, the randomness of these events, but you can, hopefully, move them away from more populated areas.��
British newspapers have scrambled to update their final editions with news of the Manchester Arena attack, which broke late on Monday night.
Not all of them managed to get their late editions onto Twitter, but those that did all splashed on the terror in Manchester.
The Manchester Evening News�셲 front page declared �쏷error at the Arena�� alongside a picture of an injured concertgoer being helped by paramedics.
The Daily Mirror went further, bumping news of Theresa May�셲 �쐂ementia tax�� U-turn out of the splash to make way for ��19 dead in pop concert �쁲uicide bomb�쇺��.
The Guardian reconfigured its front page to lead on �쏮urder in Manchester�� with a large photograph of a man, his leg bloodied and bandaged, being led from the arena.
The Daily Telegraph described the unfolding drama with the straightforward headline �쏮anchester explosion kills 19 concert-goers�� as �쐏olice investigating blast as �쁯ossible terrorist incident�쇺��.
Meanwhile the Scottish Sun tweeted out its front with the new splash which is the same as its London edition.
A suspected terrorist attack was foiled after armed police arrested a man who is alleged to have been found carrying knives near the Houses of Parliament.
The Guardian understands the operation was triggered following a tip-off to police by a member of Britain�셲 Muslim community who was concerned about the man�셲 behaviour.
Officers were lying in wait for the suspect whose movements were being tracked by a joint police and MI5 operation as he travelled into central London on Thursday. They swooped close to Westminster underground station.
The scene where the man, aged 27, was arrested is metres away from where Khalid Masood launched his attacks on Westminster Bridge and the parliamentary estate five weeks ago, leaving five people dead, including himself. Masood used a vehicle to mow down pedestrians before using a knife to stab a police officer to death.
Thursday�셲 daylight arrest followed a tense intelligence operation following the tip-off from someone who knew the suspect, with further investigation identifying the man detained as being of concern to counter-terrorism investigators. One source said the stop was �쐍ot random, it was targeted��.
The man was pinned to the ground after his arrest at 2.22pm, with armed officers standing over him. Shortly afterwards, forensic experts examined the ground where two knives had fallen, along with a bag, which is believed to have contained the knives.
It is thought the suspect, who is believed to be from the London area but born outside the United Kingdom was acting alone.
Given the location of the arrest, investigators believe one possibility was an attack on the Westminster or Whitehall areas. Past Islamist propaganda has called for attacks on civilians or symbols of power. Security is especially tight around Whitehall following last month�셲 attack .
Police said the arrest came at the junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square, barely 30 metres from Westminster Bridge.
Witnesses said the suspect wrestled to the floor by police but appeared calm after his detention.
MI5 and Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command will try to establish if the suspect had any direction from overseas, and whether Islamic State played any role �� either directly, through contact, or indirectly through its propaganda urging attacks.
The motivation of the suspect will be a key part of the investigation and his mental health will be of keen interest to investigators. At least two knife attacks, in Leytonstone in 2015 and Russell Square in 2016, thought initially to be terrorist acts, were later determined to be best explained by the suspects�� severe mental health problems.
Police said in a statement: �쏛 man has been arrested in Whitehall this afternoon, at approximately 14.22, following a stop and search as part of an ongoing operation. The man was arrested in Parliament Street �� by armed officers from the Met�셲 specialist firearms command.
�쏷he man, aged in his late 20s, was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him.
�쏦e is being detained under the Terrorism Act and is in custody in a south London police station. Detectives from the counter-terrorism command are continuing their investigation, and as a result of this arrest there is no immediate known threat.��
The suspect was held on Parliament Street for more than half an hour, without speaking or struggling. While two officers detained him, about two dozen heavily armed police blocked off the traffic and pedestrians on one side of the road with tape.
He was led away into a police car at around 3.15pm, while scene-of-crime officers examined knives and a rucksack on the traffic island in the middle of Parliament Street at the junction with Parliament Square.
The prime minister, Theresa May, praised the work by police and MI5, saying: �쏧 think it shows that our police and our intelligence and security services are on the alert as they always are, looking to keep us safe and secure.
�쏧 would say that we owe a huge debt of gratitude to these people, many of whom are unseen, unheard, yet the job they do day in, day out to keep us secure is a really important one and we should thank them for it.��
Features of the arrest were highly unusual. Police prefer to arrest terrorism suspects in dawn raids at their homes, away from any potential target of attack. One source said there may have been a need to gather evidence to secure a conviction. Arresting someone in their home with knives poses challenges of convincing a jury that a terrorist attack was planned.
Harry Peasnell, 27, and Andy Burnage, 22, were leaving a building adjacent to the scene which houses various government offices after a meeting with officials when they were told the usual entrance on to Whitehall was closed. As they left the area via an alternative route, they said they saw a man in his 20s or 30s, who they thought was the suspect, being spoken to by police next to the wall of the offices. Peasnell said police were �쐑uick on the scene�� and that he was not worried like he was during the terror attack in the area just weeks ago. �쏬ast time, all the buildings were on lockdown and no one was allowed to leave,�� he said.
Witness Ian Moss, who was travelling on a bus through Whitehall at the time, said the suspect was on the ground in the middle traffic island. He said police �쐋ooked like they were tending�� to him, adding: �쏦e was arrested. He could walk so no idea if he was injured.�� Asked if he was struggling while on the ground, Moss said: �쏯o, not at all. He had police pointing arms at him though.��
A French tourist who declined to be named, said: �쏻e just saw the man arrested and that�셲 all. He was very calm. I think they got him on the ground, then they stood him up against the wall. There were lots of policemen.��
The incident unfolded with few MPs present in the Palace of Westminster because parliament is winding down before the election and May has already headed out on to the campaign trail. However, civil servants were still working as normal and a number of HMRC staff were locked outside their building when the Whitehall entrance was closed off.The atmosphere in parliament remained calm and all gates were operating as normal during the incident.
The nervousness around security at Westminster was heightened when, in a separate incident, packages addressed to parliamentarians containing white powder were intercepted before they could reach their victims.The terrorism threat level for the United Kingdom remains at severe, meaning an attack by terrorists is assessed to be highly likely. The biggest threat is seen as coming from Islamic State, which constantly urges followers to stage attacks.
The Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), or People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, is an Iranian dissident group that has been formally designated for the last 15 years by the US State Department as a "foreign terrorist organization". When the Bush administration sought to justify its attack on Iraq in 2003 by accusing Saddam Hussein of being a sponsor of "international terrorism", one of its prime examples was Iraq's "sheltering" of the MEK. Its inclusion on the terrorist list has meant that it is a felony to provide any "material support" to that group.
Nonetheless, a large group of prominent former US government officials from both political parties has spent the last several years receiving substantial sums of cash to give speeches to the MEK, and have then become vocal, relentless advocates for the group, specifically for removing them from the terrorist list. Last year, the Christian Science Monitor thoroughly described "these former high-ranking US officials - who represent the full political spectrum - [who] have been paid tens of thousands of dollars to speak in support of the MEK." They include Democrats Howard Dean, Ed Rendell, Wesley Clark, Bill Richardson, and Lee Hamilton, and Republicans Rudy Giuliani, Fran Townsend, Tom Ridge, Michael Mukasey, and Andrew Card. Other prominent voices outside government, such as Alan Dershowitz and Elie Wiesel, have been enlisted to the cause and are steadfast MEK advocates.
Money has also been paid to journalists such as The Washington Post's Carl Bernstein and the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page. Townsend is a CNN contributor and Rendell is an MSNBC contributor, yet those MEK payments are rarely, if ever, disclosed by those media outlets when featuring those contributors (indeed, Townsend can go on CNN to opine on Iran, even urging that its alleged conduct be viewed as "an act for war", with no disclosure whatsoever during the segment of her MEK payments). Quoting a State Department official, CSM detailed how the scheme works:
On Friday, the Guardian's Washington reporter Chris McGreal added substantial information about the recipients of the funding and, especially, its sources. As he put it, the pro-MEK campaign "has seen large sums of money directed at three principal targets: members of Congress, Washington lobby groups and influential former officials", including the GOP Congressman who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers.
What makes this effort all the more extraordinary are the reports that MEK has actually intensified its terrorist and other military activities over the last couple of years. In February, NBC News reported, citing US officials, that "deadly attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists are being carried out by [MEK]" as it is "financed, trained and armed by Israel's secret service". While the MEK denies involvement, the Iranian government has echoed these US officials in insisting that the group was responsible for those assassinations. NBC also cited "unconfirmed reports in the Israeli press and elsewhere that Israel and the MEK were involved in a Nov. 12 explosion that destroyed the Iranian missile research and development site at Bin Kaneh, 30 miles outside Tehran".
In April, the New Yorker's Seymour Hersh reported that the US itself has for years provided extensive training to MEK operatives, on US soil (in other words, the US government provided exactly the "material support" for a designated terror group which the law criminalizes). Hersh cited numerous officials for the claim that "some American-supported covert operations continue in Iran today." The MEK's prime goal is the removal of Iran's government.
Despite these reports that the MEK has been engaged in terrorism and other military aggression against Iran - or, more accurately: likely because of them - it was announced on Friday the US State Department will remove MEK from its list of terrorist organizations. This event is completely unsurprising. In May, I noted the emergence of reports that the State Department would do so imminently.
Because this MEK scam more vividly illustrates the rot and corruption at the heart of America's DC-based political culture than almost any episode I can recall, I've written numerous times about it. But now that the de-listing is all but official, it is worthwhile to take note of the five clear lessons it teaches:
The past decade has seen numerous "material support" prosecutions of US Muslims for the most trivial and incidental contacts with designated terror groups. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that any Muslim who gets within sneezing distance of such a group is subject to prosecution. Indeed, as I documented last week, many of them have been prosecuted even for core First Amendment activities: political advocacy deemed supportive of such groups.
When they're convicted - and marginalized Muslims, usually poor and powerless, almost always are - they typically are not only consigned to prison for decades, but are placed in America's most oppressive and restrictive prison units. As a result, many law-abiding Muslim Americans have become petrified of donating money to Muslim charities or even speaking out against perceived injustices out of fear - the well-grounded fear - that they will be accused of materially supporting a terror group. This is all part of the pervasive climate of fear in which many American Muslims live.
Yet here we have a glittering, bipartisan cast of former US officials and other prominent Americans who are swimming in cash as they advocate on behalf of a designated terrorist organization. After receiving their cash, Howard Dean and Rudy Giuliani met with MEK leaders, and Dean actually declared that the group's leader should be recognized by the west as President of Iran. That is exactly the type of coordinated messaging with a terrorist group with the supreme court found, in its 2010 Humanitarian Law v. Holder ruling, could, consistent with the First Amendment, lead to prosecution for "material support of terrorism" (ironically, numerous MEK shills, including CNN's Townsend, praised the supreme court for its broad reading of that statute when they thought, correctly, that it was being applied to Muslims).
Yet other than a reported Treasury Department investigation several months ago to determine the source of Ed Rendell's MEK speaking fees - an investigation that seems to have gone nowhere - there has been no repercussions whatsoever from this extensive support given by these DC luminaries to this designated terror group. Now that MEK will be removed from the terror list, there almost certainly never will be any consequences (as a legal matter, the de-listing should have no impact on the possible criminality of this MEK support: the fact that a group is subsequently removed from the list does not retroactively legalize the providing of material support when it was on the list).
In sum, there are numerous American Muslims sitting in prison for years for far less substantial interactions with terror groups than this bipartisan group of former officials gave to MEK. This is what New York Times Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal meant when he wrote back in March that the 9/11 attacks have "led to what's essentially a separate justice system for Muslims". The converse is equally true: America's political elites can engage in the most egregious offenses - torture, illegal eavesdropping, money-driven material support for a terror group - with complete impunity.
The history of the US list of designated terrorist organizations, and its close cousin list of state sponsors of terrorism, is simple: a country or group goes on the list when they use violence to impede US interests, and they are then taken off the list when they start to use exactly the same violence to advance US interests. The terrorist list is not a list of terrorists; it's a list of states and groups which use their power to defy US dictates rather than adhere to them.
The NYU scholar Remi Brulin has exhaustively detailed the rank game-playing that has taken place with this list: Saddam was put on it when he allied with the Soviets in the early 1980s, then was taken off when the US wanted to arm and fund him against Iran in the mid-1980s, then he was put back on in the early 1990s when the US wanted to attack him.
And now, with the MEK, we have a group that, at least according to some reports, appears to have intensified its terrorism, and yet they are removed from the list. Why? Because now they are aligned against the prime enemy of the US and Israel - and working closely with those two nations - and are therefore, magically, no longer "terrorists". As the Iran experts Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett wrote on Friday:
They answered their own question: "We have seen too many times over the years just how cynically American administrations have manipulated these designations, adding and removing organizations and countries for reasons that have little or nothing to do with designees' actual involvement in terrorist activity." In other words, the best and most efficient way to be removed from the list is to start engaging in terrorism for and in conjunction with the US and its allies (i.e. Israel) rather than against them.
The US government did not even pretend that terrorism had anything to do with its decision as to whether MEK should be de-listed. Instead, they used the carrot of de-listing, and the threat of remaining on the list, to pressure MEK leaders to adhere to US demands to abandon their camp in Iraq. But what does adhering to this US demand have to do with terrorism? Nothing. This list has nothing to do with terrorism. It is simply a way the US rewards those who comply with its dictates and punishes those who refuse.
Terrorism, at least in its applied sense, means little other than: violence used by enemies of the US and its allies. Violence used by the US and its allies (including stateless groups) can never be terrorism, no matter how heinous and criminal.
MEK achieved its goal by doing more than merely changing the beneficiaries of its actions from Saddam to the US and Israel. It also found a way - how it did so remains a mystery - to funnel millions of dollars into the bank accounts of key ex-officials from both parties, a bipartisan list of DC lobbyist firms, and several key journalists. In other words, it achieved its policy aims the same way most groups in DC do: by buying influence within both parties, and paying influence-peddlers who parlay their political celebrity into personal riches.
So pervasive is this scam that most people have become utterly numb to it (that's because people are willing to acquiesce to most evils when they become perceived as common; that acquiescence is often justified as worldly sophistication). As a result, there was no pretense here to hide these sleazy transactions. The very idea that Ed Rendell suddenly woke up one day and developed an overnight, never-before-seen passion for the MEK and Iran policy is just laughable. But the former Pennsylvania governor is a key advocate to enlist - he remains well connected within the Democratic Party and now has an important platform on MSNBC - so on the payroll he went.
Once the bipartisan list of DC officials receiving cash from MEK became known, it became almost impossible to imagine any outcome other than this one. As one person tweeted after reading this State Department decision: any American billionaire could easily have his birthday declared a national holiday by simply spreading the cash around enough to DC political and media figures on a bipartisan basis.
Over the last decade, the US has had Iran almost entirely encircled, thanks in part - only in part - to large-scale ground invasions of the nations on its eastern and western borders. Some combination of Israel and the US have launched cyberwarfare at the Iranians, murdered their civilian scientists, and caused explosions on its soil. The American president and the Israeli government continuously and publicly threaten to use force against them.
And now, the US has taken a key step in ensuring that a group devoted to the overthrow of the regime, a group that sided with Saddam in his war against Iran, is able to receive funding and otherwise be fully admitted into the precincts of international respectability. Just imagine if Iran took steps to legitimize an American rebel group that has long been devoted to the overthrow of the US government and which has a long history of serious violence on US soil.
Not just the Iranian government, but also most of its citizens, are likely to perceive this de-listing as exactly what it is: yet another act of aggression toward their nation. As the Christian Science Monitor said of the group, it is "widely despised inside Iran". But the US has now officially offered a clear gesture of legitimization, if not support, for this group, one that only exacerbates the war-threatening tensions between the two nations.
Several commenters have raised questions about the motives of Dershowitz and Wiesel in supporting MEK. While motives can never be known with certainty - one can attempt only to make inferences based on conduct and circumstances - it was the JTA, the self-described "global news service of the Jewish people", which reported their involvement, and they suggested the motive was not any receipt of money but rather MEK's alignment with Israel:
A separate JTA article reporting on the de-listing noted that "Iranian Americans sympathetic to the plight of MEK enlisted the support of a number of pro-Israel figures, including Nobel Peace laureate and Holocaust memoirist Elie Wiesel; Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz; and Irwin Cotler, the former Canadian justice minister." The original sentence has been clarified to reflect this report.
David Williams did not have an easy life. He moved to Newburgh, a gritty, impoverished town on the banks of the Hudson an hour or so north of New York, at just 10 years old. For a young, black American boy with a father in jail, trouble was everywhere.
Williams also made bad choices. He ended up going to jail for dealing drugs. When he came out in 2007 he tried to go straight, but money was tight and his brother, Lord, needed cash for a liver transplant. Life is hard in Newburgh if you are poor, have a drug rap and need cash quickly.
His aunt, Alicia McWilliams, was honest about the tough streets her nephew was dealing with. "Newburgh is a hard place," she said. So it was perhaps no surprise that in May, 2009, David Williams was arrested again and hit with a 25-year jail sentence. But it was not for drugs offences. Or any other common crime. Instead Williams and three other struggling local men beset by drug, criminal and mental health issues were convicted of an Islamic terrorist plot to blow up Jewish synagogues and shoot down military jets with missiles.
Even more shocking was that the organisation, money, weapons and motivation for this plot did not come from real Islamic terrorists. It came from the FBI, and an informant paid to pose as a terrorist mastermind paying big bucks for help in carrying out an attack. For McWilliams, her own government had actually cajoled and paid her beloved nephew into being a terrorist, created a fake plot and then jailed him for it. "I feel like I am in the Twilight Zone," she told the Guardian.
Lawyers for the so-called Newburgh Four have now launched an appeal that will be held early next year. Advocates hope the case offers the best chance of exposing the issue of FBI "entrapment" in terror cases. "We have as close to a legal entrapment case as I have ever seen," said Susanne Brody, who represents another Newburgh defendant, Onta Williams.
Some experts agree. "The target, the motive, the ideology and the plot were all led by the FBI," said Karen Greenberg, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, who specialises in studying the new FBI tactics.
But the issue is one that stretches far beyond Newburgh. Critics say the FBI is running a sting operation across America, targeting �� to a large extent �� the Muslim community by luring people into fake terror plots. FBI bureaux send informants to trawl through Muslim communities, hang out in mosques and community centres, and talk of radical Islam in order to identify possible targets sympathetic to such ideals. Or they will respond to the most bizarre of tip-offs, including, in one case, a man who claimed to have seen terror chief Ayman al-Zawahiri living in northern California in the late 1990s.
That tipster was quickly hired as a well-paid informant. If suitable suspects are identified, FBI agents then run a sting, often creating a fake terror plot in which it helps supply weapons and targets. Then, dramatic arrests are made, press conferences held and lengthy convictions secured.
But what is not clear is if many real, actual terrorists are involved.
Another "entrapment" case is on the radar too. The Fort Dix Five �� accused of plotting to attack a New Jersey army base �� have also appealed against their convictions. That case too involved dubious use of paid informants, an apparent over-reach of evidence and a plot that seemed suggested by the government.
Burim Duka, whose three brothers were jailed for life for their part in the scheme, insists they did not know they were part of a terror plot and were just buying guns for shooting holidays in a deal arranged by a friend. The "friend" was an informant who had persuaded another man of a desire to attack Fort Dix.
Duka is convinced his brothers' appeal has a good chance. "I am hopeful," he told the Guardian.
But things may not be that easy. At issue is the word "entrapment", which has two definitions. There is the common usage, where a citizen might see FBI operations as deliberate traps manipulating unwary people who otherwise were unlikely to become terrorists. Then there is the legal definition of entrapment, where the prosecution merely has to show a subject was predisposed to carry out the actions they later are accused of.
Theoretically, a simple expression, like support for jihad, might suffice, and in post-9/11 America neither judges nor juries tend to be nuanced in terror trials. "Legally, you have to use the word entrapment very carefully. It is a very strict legal term," said Greenberg.
But in its commonly understood usage, FBI entrapment is a widespread tactic. Within days of the 9/11 terror attacks, FBI director Robert Mueller issued a memo on a new policy of "forward leaning �� preventative �� prosecutions".
Central to that is a growing informant network. The FBI is not choosy about the people it uses. Some have criminal records, including attempted murder or drug dealing or fraud. They are often paid six-figure sums, which critics say creates a motivation to entrap targets. Some are motivated by the promise of debts forgiven or immigration violations wiped clean. There has also been a relaxing of rules on what criteria the FBI needs to launch an investigation.
Often they just seem to be "fishing expeditions". In the Newburgh case, the men involved met FBI informant Shahed Hussain simply because he happened to infiltrate their mosque. In southern California, FBI informant Craig Monteilh trawled mosques posing as a Muslim and tried to act as a magnet for potential radicals.
Monteilh, who bugged scores of people, is a convicted felon with serious drug charges to his name. His operation turned up nothing. But Monteilh's professed terrorist sympathy so unnerved his Muslim targets that they got a restraining order against him and alerted the FBI, not realising Monteilh was actually working on the bureau's behalf.
Muslim civil rights groups have warned of a feeling of being hounded and threatened by the FBI, triggering a natural fear of the authorities among people that should be a vital defence against real terror attacks. But FBI tactics could now be putting off many people from reporting tip-offs or suspicious individuals.
"They are making mosques suspicious of anybody. They are putting fear into these communities," said Greenberg. Civil liberties groups are also concerned, seeing some FBI tactics as using terrorism to justify more power. "We are still seeing an expansion of these tools. It is a terrible prospect," said Mike German, an expert at the American Civil Liberties Union and a former FBI agent who has worked in counter-terrorism.
German said suspects convicted of plotting terror attacks in some recent FBI cases bore little resemblance to the profile of most terrorist cells. "Most of these suspect terrorists had no access to weapons unless the government provided them. I would say that showed they were not the biggest threat to the US," German said.
"Most terrorists have links to foreign terrorist groups and have trained in terrorism training camps. Perhaps FBI resources should be spent finding those guys."
Also, some of the most serious terrorist attacks carried out in the US since 9/11 have revolved around "lone wolf" actions, not the sort of conspiracy plots the FBI have been striving to combat. The 2010 Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, only came to light after his car bomb failed to go off properly. The Fort Hood killer Nidal Malik Hasan, who shot dead 13 people on a Texas army base in 2009, was only discovered after he started firing. Both evaded the radar of an FBI expending resources setting up fictional crimes and then prosecuting those involved.
Yet, as advocates for those caught up in "entrapment" cases discover, there is little public or judicial sympathy for them. Even in cases where judges have admitted FBI tactics have raised serious questions, there has been no hesitation in returning guilty verdicts, handing down lengthy sentences and dismissing appeals.
The Liberty City Seven are a case in point. The 2006 case involved an informant, Elie Assaad, with a dubious past (he was once arrested, but not charged, for beating his pregnant wife). Assaad was let loose with another informant on a group of men in Liberty City, a poor, predominantly black, suburb of Miami. The targets were followers of a cult-like group called The Seas of David, led by former Guardian Angel Narseal Batiste.
The group was, perhaps, not even Muslim, as its religious practices involved Bible study and wearing the Star of David. Yet Assaad posed as an Al-Qaida operative, and got members of the group to swear allegiance. Transcripts of the "oath-taking" ceremony are almost farcical. Batiste repeatedly queries the idea and appears bullied into it. In effect, defence lawyers argued, the men were confused, impoverished members of an obscure cult.
Yet targets the group supposedly entertained attacking included the Sears Tower in Chicago, Hollywood movie studios and the Empire State Building. Even zealous prosecutors, painting a picture of dedicated Islamic terrorists, admitted any potential plots were "aspirational", given the group had no means to carry them out.
Nonetheless, they were charged with seeking to wage war against America, plotting to destroy buildings and supporting terrorism. Five of them got long jail sentences. Assaad, who was recently arrested in Texas for attempting to run over a policeman, was paid $85,000 for his work.
This year the jailed Liberty City men launched an appeal and last week judgment was handed down. They lost, and officially remain Islamic terrorists hell-bent on destroying America. Not that their supporters see it that way.
"Our country is no safer as a result of the prosecution of these seven impoverished young men from Liberty City," said Batiste's lawyer, Ana Jhones.
"This prosecution came at great financial cost to our government, and at a terrible emotional cost to these defendants and their families. It is my sincere belief that our country is less safe as a result of the government's actions in this case."
President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia would like the United States to remove the country�셲 largest rebel group from its list of terrorist organizations and suspend drug warrants against guerrilla commanders if he seals a peace deal to end the country�셲 five-decade civil war.
In an interview days before a key visit to the White House, Santos said that once a deal is signed it would be appropriate for the Obama administration to strike the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, from a State Department list of terrorist organizations where it has been included for almost two decades.The Farc, which as part of peace talks has already renounced kidnapping and declared a unilateral truce, has long demanded it be excluded.
�쏧f they sign it�셲 because we have a timetable for their disarmament and they have committed themselves to lay down their arms and make this transition to legal life. So I would say yes, I hope that they would be eliminated from the terror list,�� said Santos.
His 4 February meeting with President Barack Obama will celebrate 15 years and some $10bn in US counterinsurgency and anti-narcotics aid to its staunchest ally in the region.
The high-profile meeting underscores Colombia�셲 historic moment: the peace talks taking place in Cuba have reached what both sides describe as a point of no return, with a final deal to end a half century of bloodshed expected as early as March.This week the UN security council unanimously endorsed sending a mission to monitor an eventual accord, handing Santos a diplomatic victory as he tries to drum up funding for what he said will be a 10- to 15-year effort to recover vast parts of the country he says had been ceded by the state to illegal armed groups.
When pressed about how soon after the accord is inked should the Farc be removed from the US terror list, Santos said �쐔he shorter the better��. A Colombian paramilitary umbrella group had to wait a full six years after it completely disarmed to be removed.
In the same vein, he said he would like to see the US follow his lead in Colombia and suspend arrest warrants targeting the Farc�셲 top leadership, many of whom are negotiating in Havana.US federal prosecutors in a 2006 indictment accused 50 Farc leaders of supplying more than half of the world�셲 cocaine �� claims that Santos said were exaggerated and out of sync with commitments made at the negotiating table to abandon its involvement in the drug trade and help the government eradicate cocaine crops.
�쏛ny effort by the United States to allow us to apply transitional justice, for example by suspending the arrest warrants, would help us tremendously,�� he said.
Coca production skyrocketed 39% in 2014 and many experts say it will climb even further after Santos last year halted a US-backed aerial eradication campaign over health concerns.
He likened the Farc�셲 charging of a war tax on cocaine moving through territory it dominates to tactics used by the Irish Republican Army in its fight with Britain.
�쏷he way the IRA was robbing banks, the guerrillas were financing themselves from drug trafficking,�� he said.
But he warned that if guerrillas continue to enrich themselves through drugs all bets are off.
�쏬et�셲 be very clear: if they don�셳 behave, they�셪l be extradited,�� he said.
US officials have long insisted that only prosecutors can suspend the warrants. A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, declined to comment on Thursday.
Santos, a former defense and finance minister and the scion of the family that founded Colombia�셲 largest newspaper, described Colombia�셲 evolution from a near failed state when Plan Colombia began under President Bill Clinton into one of the world�셲 fastest-growing emerging markets with lower levels of conflict-linked violence.
As the country has stabilized, US aid has steadily declined from almost $1bn a year to about a third of that now. He said with a peace deal, demands for spending will surge as Colombia attempts to build roads, schools and extend the state�셲 reach to traditionally forsaken and economically unproductive areas.
He said he is optimistic that US aid to Colombia, which until now has had bipartisan support, will jump again and plans to discuss future funding with Obama. He will also meet with Republican leaders in Congress, some of whom have echoed criticisms by conservatives in Colombia that Santos is easing up on the war on drugs and being too lenient with the rebels behind scores of atrocities.
�쏞olombia is at a tipping point,�� Santos said. �쏧f we receive the help that we need, because we are in a difficult situation financially as is all of Latin America, we can take advantage of this new situation.��
In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state
 of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the
 American people.
We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on
 the ground - passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you
 please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.
We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past
 exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of
 blood, the saying of prayers - in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the
 decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.
My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of
 our Union - and it is strong.
Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief
 has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice,
 or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.
I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was
 touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined
 together on the steps of this Capitol, singing "God Bless America." And you did more
 than sing; you acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the
 needs of our military.
Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I
 thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our
 country.
And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of
 support. America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at
 Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.
We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul,
 or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of
 silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America.
Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of
 Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women
 from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens. America has
 no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a
 great cause - so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his
 unity of purpose with America. Thank you for coming, friend.
On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our
 country. Americans have known wars - but for the past 136 years, they have been wars
 on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of
 war - but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known
 surprise attacks - but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought
 upon us in a single day - and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself
 is under attack.
Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our
 country? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated
 terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are the same murderers indicted for
 bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the
 USS Cole.
Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its
 goal is remaking the world - and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.
The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by
 Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics - a fringe movement that
 perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill
 Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and
 civilians, including women and children.
This group and its leader - a person named Osama bin Laden - are linked to many
 other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the
 Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than
 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought
 to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They
 are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and
 destruction.
The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban
 regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda's vision for
 the world.
Afghanistan's people have been brutalized - many are starving and many have
 fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a
 television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in
 Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.
The United States respects the people of Afghanistan - after all, we are currently its
 largest source of humanitarian aid - but we condemn the Taliban
 regime. It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people
 everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting
 murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.
And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the
 Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your
 land. Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have
 unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your
 country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in
 Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to
 appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist
 training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.
These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban
 must act, and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in
 their fate.
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your
 faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in
 countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those
 who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The
 terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy
 of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy
 is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them.
Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until
 every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.
Americans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what we see right here in this
 chamber - a democratically elected government. Their leaders are
 self-appointed. They hate our freedoms - our freedom of religion, our freedom of
 speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.
They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt,
 Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to
 drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.
These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life. With
 every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and
 forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in their way.
We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They
 are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human
 life to serve their radical visions - by abandoning every value except the will to power -
 they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism. And they will follow
 that path all the way, to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.
Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every resource
 at our command - every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every
 instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of
 war - to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.
This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of
 territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years
 ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat.
Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans
 should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever
 seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even
 in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive
 them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations
 that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a
 decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From
 this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded
 by the United States as a hostile regime.
Our nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take
 defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of federal
 departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities
 affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So
 tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me - the
 Office of Homeland Security.
And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen
 American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted
 friend - Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee and coordinate a
 comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond
 to any attacks that may come.
These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our
 way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.
Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the
 reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all have our
 prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for
 our military: Be ready. I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason. The
 hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud.
This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is not just America's
 freedom. This is the world's fight. This is civilization's fight. This is the fight of all who
 believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.
We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces,
 intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The United States is
 grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded
 - with sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to
 Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the
 world: An attack on one is an attack on all.
The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes
 unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror, unanswered, can not
 only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And
 you know what - we're not going to allow it.
Americans are asking: What is expected of us? I ask you to live your lives, and hug
 your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and
 resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat.
I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come
 here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by
 them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of
 their ethnic background or religious faith.
I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your
 contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information,
 libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York,
 Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your
 cooperation, and I ask you to give it.
I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter
 security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle.
I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists
 attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is
 successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people. These
 were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our
 strengths today.
And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those
 in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help
 strengthen us for the journey ahead.
Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will
 do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for
 what you have already done and for what we will do together.
Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve
 air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights, and
 take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and
 keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency.
We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down
 terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence
 capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and find them before they
 strike.
We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy, and put
 our people back to work.
Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New
 Yorkers: Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As a
 symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two
 leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.
After all that has just passed - all the lives taken, and all the possibilities and hopes
 that died with them - it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some
 speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face. But
 this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States
 of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age
 of liberty, here and across the world.
Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and
 anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The
 advance of human freedom - the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of
 every time - now depends on us. Our nation - this generation - will lift a dark threat
 of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our
 efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not
 fail.
It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to
 normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief recedes
 with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what
 happened that day, and to whom it happened. We'll remember the moment the news
 came - where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire,
 or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.
And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at
 the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as
 a proud memorial to her son. This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that
 does not end.
I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it. I will not yield; I will
 not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American
 people.
The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear,
 justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral
 between them.
Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice - assured of the rightness of our
 cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant
 us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America.
Eighty-four people died late on Thursday night as a lorry drove for more than a mile through the Bastille Day crowds in the southern French city of Nice. The driver eventually died in a hail of police bullets. The incident, on a day when the French celebrate equality, liberty and fraternity, could hardly be more horrific.
The victims are beyond help, but the French people should have whatever sympathy the world can usefully offer. The danger is that ritualised global responses to these incidents become their megaphone. They raise the multiplier impact of the terror �� and also raise public expectation that �쐓omething can be done��.
The French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, has extended for three months the state of emergency resulting from the Charlie Hebdo killings and the events in Paris last November. He has announced, yet again, that France is �쏿t war�� with the threat of Islamist terrorism.
A further 10,000 army reservists are to be deployed. �쏛ctivities will be strengthened�� in Iraq and Syria. In London and Washington counter-terrorism agencies are on alert, and President Obama is �쐀eing updated by his national security team��.
Such responses may comfort the citizens of Nice in their state of shock. But there is no defence force on Earth that can defend a crowd from a madman in a truck.
Since their invention at the end of the 19th century, motor vehicles have been agencies of terror and death. The first car bomb was �쏝uda�셲 wagon��, which blasted Wall Street in 1920. Cars and trucks are not going to be banned, any more than America is going to ban guns. The only sensible response is to accept the degree of risk that they will always pose, and not pretend it can be made to disappear.
Defence lobbyists have become adept at drawing strength from terrorist incidents, citing them in the cause of ever more money and advanced kit. It was grimly ironic that the Nice crowd had just watched an aerial display by France�셲 lavish force of jet fighters. They were as much use as peashooters in the �쐗ar�� that was subsequently unleashed on their onlookers �� as was France�셲 arsenal of nuclear missiles and aircraft carriers.
Hollande might more usefully have called up 10,000 psychologists or 10,000 Islamic historians. As for strengthening France�셲 role in the Islamist civil wars in Iraq and Syria, it is hard to imagine anything more likely to incite other young men to suicide attacks.
A Nice truck driver does not remotely threaten the security of the French state, any more than such acts do the security of America or Britain. The identification of the nation state with random killings of innocent people has become a political aberration.
The implication that leaders can somehow prevent such attacks by armed response is a total distraction from the intelligence and police work that might at least diminish their prevalence. It nationalises and institutionalises public alarm. It leads governments into madcap adventurism abroad and �쐓ecuritises�� the private lives of citizens at home.
What has happened in France is tragic and calls for human sympathy. Beyond that, there is nothing we can usefully do �� other than make matters worse.
Londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at Westminster, sharing messages of solidarity on social media.
#WeAreNotAfraid was trending in London as users reacted to the deaths of five people, including the attacker, on Wednesday and expressed gratitude and support for the work of emergency services.
Many vowed not to be cowed by terrorism.
Comedian and actor Margaret Cabourn-Smith characterised this tenor of the response, tweeting: ��#WeAreNotAfraid Or rather I am; but I�셫 damned if I�셫 going to let that stop me doing anything differently.
�쏮y heart goes out to all the people who went out this morning thinking it was gonna be �쁧ust another day��,�� tweeted one user with a photo of the British Gas advert, �쏻e are Londoners��.
Twitter user @HillyFoz shared a blurry nighttime snap of the London Eye, noting that the city had not been brought to a halt by the attack.
�쏬ondon�셲 just going about its business,�� she commented. �쏱ubs and theatres still full. Trains packed. Everyone looks a little sadder but #WeAreNotAfraid.��
Conservative party MP Will Quince echoed this resolve in quoting the UK Parliament�셲 tweet that confirmed that both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would sit on Thursday at their normal times.
He added: �쏛fter a tragic day in Westminster, our democracy continues tomorrow. Terrorism will never defeat us. #WeAreNotAfraid��
Many users shared a London Underground logo modified to bear the slogan �쏻e Are Not Afraid�� to demonstrate their defiance in the face of terror.
The message of solidarity extended across the world, with the Westminster attack occurring one year on from the terror attack in Brussels.
The Eiffel Tower�셲 lights were turned off at midnight in tribute to the victims of the attack.
Hen Mazzig, a former humanitarian officer with the Israeli defence force, tweeted an image showing the Tel Aviv city hall lit up as the Union Jack.
Video journalist Rav Vadgama�셲 message of resolve was on a far smaller scale, and stereotypically British: �쏯o place for terrorism, only tea. #WeAreNotAfraid��
Brussels has been blanketed with security after the Belgian government raised alert levels on terrorist threats to the maximum, warning of the �쐓erious and imminent�� possibility of a Paris-style attack involving firearms and explosives.
The city�셲 metro system was closed down on Saturday until Sunday afternoon at the earliest as shops shut, shopping malls were partly shuttered, professional football was cancelled, concerts were called off and music venues, museums, and galleries closed their doors for the weekend.
The heightened alert level followed meetings of the national security and counter-terror services late on Friday, which concluded, on the basis of undisclosed evidence, that a major attack was being planned in Brussels. The rest of the country was put on a level three alert, one level short of the maximum.
The measures are thought to have been implemented over fears that Salah Abdeslam is hiding in the Brussels area. The 26-year-old Frenchman is believed to be one of the ringleaders of the Paris attacks in which 130 people died last Friday. He has reportedly been in touch with friends on Skype asking for help in getting back to Syria.
�쏤ollowing a new assessment, the terror alert level has been raised to level four, very serious, for the Brussels region,�� said a government statement. �쏛nalysis shows a serious and imminent threat that requires taking specific security measures as well as specific recommendations for the public.��
People were told to avoid rail stations and airports, shopping centres, concerts, and other public events where people congregate.
�쏻e�셱e mobilising very strong security capacities,�� said Charles Michel, the prime minister. �쏷here�셲 a threat of attack by several individuals in several places. The [crisis centre] took this decision following information on a risk of attack similar to Paris.��
In sleet and the first freezing temperatures of the winter, the roads remained busy in a city known for traffic congestion. Local supermarkets were as busy as ever on a Saturday afternoon, open-air markets operated normally and were well-attended despite the weather and the worry.
There was however an edginess in the city�셲 central shopping area, with security personnel posted at the doors to shops checking bags and rucksacks on entry. Many shops and cafes lowered their shutters. By the afternoon, about half of city-centre shops had closed , while armoured personnel carriers restricted movement in the old city centre.
It is well-known that Belgium supplies by far the most foreign fighters to Syria compared to other EU countries in per capita terms and that Molenbeek is where they are concentrated. Jan Jambon, the interior minister and a Flemish nationalist, said that of 130 foreign fighters who were known to have come home from Syria, 85 were living in the small Brussels borough of Molenbeek just west of the city centre. He demanded that the local authorities conduct a �쐂oor-by-door�� vetting of who was living in every house and flat in the borough.
The mayors of Brussels�� 19 boroughs met at least twice and recommended a thorough lockdown of the city, not all of which was observed. A city centre mayor announced that a popular local market had been cancelled. In fact, it was operating as normal.
Municipal facilities across the city, such as sports and arts centres, libraries, and swimming pools, were all ordered to close. The Sunday morning market at the Gare du Midi, the Eurostar terminal �� one of the biggest outdoor markets in Europe �� was called off.
It appeared many of the cancellations and closures were meant to relieve pressure on the security forces who would be stretched too thin if mobilised to cover public events. Armed police as well as army personnel patrolled the central streets on foot, while police vehicles were ubiquitous.
Brussels is home to Nato headquarters and the US embassy in the city advised Americans to cancel their weekend plans.
�쏶helter in place and remain at home. If you must go out, avoid large crowds. US citizens are urged to avoid public places such as major pedestrian walkways and shopping centres. If you were planning to attend an event, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Exercise caution in public transportation systems, sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas, shopping malls and other tourist destinations.��
The Foreign office delivered similar advice for the high numbers of Britons in Brussels.
The words "terrorism" and "terrorists" were coined in the wake of the French revolution to describe the "men of blood" who established and exercised the mechanisms of fearsome repression �� the Revolutionary Tribunal, its Law of Suspects and the guillotine �� designed to conquer tyranny and secure liberty in the name of the sovereign people. "Liberty or Death", the Jacobins proudly proclaimed, before their club was closed. "Did you want a revolution without a revolution?" Robespierre sharply remarked.
In her provocative essay, Sophie Wahnich has new things to say about the difference between today's terrorists and their nominal 18th-century predecessors. She also offers a bold reconstruction of the emotions that drove the French revolutionaries to terror, reminding her readers that this particular period of history remains a political laboratory where it is possible to ask extreme questions about the causes and consequences of revolutionary violence. Her premise is that dismissive disgust at blood spilt and life lost is an edifying but overly simplistic and apolitical response to revolution past and present.
On the putative connection between the French revolution and the terrorists of 9/11 Wahnich is clear: "Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense." In her conclusion she reiterates the disjunction: "The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States."
According to Wahnich, there is an analogy to be drawn between 1793 and 2001, in the way the French revolutionaries and the Americans responded to "being in fear" by seeking common resistance to the enemy through anger, courage and justice. But here the analogy ends because, "the Americans, despite what they say, do not live in a time of foundation, and we have not finished observing the forms of dread that the American response has provoked �� the dread of a violence that is not foundational but policing, and recently also preventative."
The French revolutionaries, in contrast, did live at a time of foundation (of new political values), represented by the universal "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen", which, Wahnich argues, could not be secured without heroism in the face of profanation. On her account, the price of the Terror was "a sacred transaction in which the foundation of values required the death of men, in which body and soul had to be committed, and anyone could perish from fear or be overcome by disgust. This in my view is the forgotten price of the Revolution, the buried price of the Terror �� a price that is indissociably moral and political at once, and that lies in discomfort, risk and a gamble."
Wahnich is especially good at describing the fracturing of the revolutionary movement over the question of clemency. On the one hand, Danton �� "Since when is man infallible and exempt from error?" �� who could ask pardon on the scaffold for his role in establishing the institutions of the Terror. On the other hand, Saint Just, who asked for no forgiveness but pointed to the copy of the Declaration of Rights on the wall of the room in which he was held the night before his execution and said: "After all, I did that!" As for Robespierre, there is no way of knowing whether he had regrets about the price of the Terror, or thought the gamble had paid off. In the end he could not speak because half his jaw was shot off (by his own hand or another) and when he gestured for a pen, no one would give him one. But such had been his commitment of body and soul to the revolution, for good or ill, that regret seems unlikely.
Wahnich's essay contributes to and is informed by a reassertion of the left's historiographical grip on the revolution. In this story, the historian Fran챌ois Furet is the arch enemy, for stridently declaring on the eve of the bicentenary in 1989: "the French Revolution is over!" Furet's heirs are derided for focusing attention on the liberal constitutional aspirations of 1789, instead of the dark days of the Terror, which surely played a part in the founding of our western democracies.
An introduction by Slavoj 탐i탑ek ill-serves this book. Gushingly and flamboyantly welcoming �� "we were not waiting merely for a book like this; this is the book we were waiting for" �� he opens with Zhou Enlai's well-worn quip that "it is still too early to tell" what the French revolution has achieved. Then comes an anticapitalist rant that makes passing reference to a number of contemporary films. It is only in the last paragraph of his introduction that 탐i탑ek reminds himself to get "back to Wahnich's book". Finally, he issues some orders: "�� the reader should approach its topic �� terror and terrorism �� without ideological fears and taboos, as a crucial contribution not only to the history of the emancipatory movements but also as a reflection on our own predicament. Do not be afraid of its topic: the fear that prevents you from confronting it is the fear of freedom, of the price one has to pay for freedom."
Being frightened of terror and terrorism and refusing to think carefully and accurately about the topic are not the same thing. Nor is being frightened of terror and terrorism necessarily connected to the fear of freedom, or the price one might be made to pay for freedom in specific political circumstances. Many of the participants in the French revolution thought long and hard about such questions, and while it is sometimes difficult to understand their thoughts, and not always comfortable to do so, it is always interesting to go back into that perennial political laboratory and try. Wahnich's provocative book is testament to that.

A police commissioner has caused alarm among rank and file officers by suggesting that members of the public who own guns could help defend rural areas against terror attacks. Alison Hernandez, the Devon and Cornwall police and crime commissioner, said she was interested in having a conversation with the chief constable about whether ordinary people with gun licences could assist in a terrorist crisis.
The comments have caused alarm within the force and prompted a stern warning from a senior officer that citizens should not arm themselves.
Hernandez, a former Conservative election agent, made her comments during an extraordinary exchange with a caller to a phone-in programme on BBC Radio Cornwall. The caller, from Bude in north Cornwall, said she was a gun owner and a former firearms dealer and asked: �쏧f there should ever be a terrorist attack, what happens if I and other people try to defend themselves using those guns? What would be the repercussions?��
Hernandez replied that it was a �쏿 very good question�� and asked the woman if she would put it in writing so that the chief constable, Shaun Sawyer, could consider it. But she then added: �쏷his might be some of our solution to our issues.��
When challenged by presenter Laurence Reed if she was advocating vigilantism, Hernandez replied: �쏧�셫 just saying, let�셲 officially have a look at that and see what would be the implications of it. Let�셲 unpick it a little bit.
�쏻e work with businesses to keep our communities safe. I�셝 really be interested in exploring that with the chief constable.��
The presenter asked the caller if she would be happy taking on a terrorist. She replied: �쏽es,�� prompting Hernandez to remark: �쏶he�셲 not messing about. Don�셳 go down to Bude.�쒿he presenter said he could not believe the chief constable would entertain the idea of the public defending themselves with firearms. Hernandez replied: �쏧�셫 sure he wouldn�셳 want to entertain it, but these are times that are challenging and I would like to have an official response on that myself.��
The official response came swiftly from the deputy chief constable, Paul Netherton, who said: �쏲uite obviously, a marauding terrorist is the most challenging of circumstances. The police response requires significant professionalism and training as well as firearms capability. During these incidents, highly trained police firearms officers and special forces will be deployed to protect our communities.
�쏹nder no circumstances would we want members of the public to arm themselves with firearms, not least because officers responding would not know who the offenders were, and quite obviously they would not have the time to ask. Our message to the public is a simple one: to run, to hide and to tell.��
Rank and file officers also made it clear that they did not believe it was a good idea for members of the public to take up arms. Janice Adam, from the Police Federation, said reacting to and dealing with any such incidents should be left to highly specialised firearms officers. There was no reply from Hernandez�� office on Monday evening.
It was once the most feared address in Berlin, a place easy to enter but very hard to leave. Now the ruins of the former engine room of Nazi terror at Prinz Albrecht Strasse in Berlin have been preserved in a new exhibition space open to the public from tomorrow.
Adolf Hitler's elite killers, the SS, the Gestapo secret police and the Reich Main Security Office ran their central operations from the site, making it the main cog in the Nazi regime.
"Our aim is to show the topography of how the Nazi-initiated terror was implemented and how both the Nazi party and state institutions merged together," said the director of the Topography of Terror museum, Andreas Nachama, a rabbi and historian. "It holds lessons about the workings of other dictatorships as well... The Pinochet dictatorship in Chile or the military junta in Argentina."
The monument is yet another piece in the puzzle of Germany's attempts to come to terms with its Nazi past and reinforces its reputation as a country which like no other has painstakingly documented its misdeeds.
It was from Prinz Albrecht Strasse that the concentration camps were administered, where the deadly military taskforces were managed and detailed records of regime opponents were kept. The Wannsee Protocol laying out the plan and execution of the Holocaust was also finalised in offices on the site, while in nearby prison cells thousands of people �� among them Jews, Roma and Nazi opponents �� were held and often tortured before being sent to concentration camps.
What makes the Topography of Terror different from many other memorials or museums in the city dedicated to victims of the Nazis, such as the huge Holocaust memorial next to the Brandenburg Gate, or the Jewish Museum designed by Daniel Libeskind, is that it is on an authentic site.
For years it has drawn tourists, attracting about half a million a year who have traipsed through a provisional subterranean exhibition in the cellars of former buildings and walked over some cracked paving stones. But now a new 짚25m, two-storey steel and glass rectangle, by architect Ursula Wilms, will house the grim history of this corner of Berlin.
Looming in front of the museum, you would have found the former Nazi air ministry of Hermann G철ring, (now the finance ministry), the former Prussian parliament building (now the Berlin MPs' house), and a strip of the Berlin Wall, which ran along the site's edge �� all of which have earned it the description of "most historically contaminated" site in a city heaving with reminders of its past. Its proximity to the wall helped save the site from demolition or redevelopment because for years, no one was much interested in it. Over the decades it served as a driving practise strip, a storage space for building materials and a dog walking scrubland, before a citizens' initiative started work on preserving it in 1987.
Deliberate efforts have been made to retain the scrubby look, as a reminder that it was neglected for years.
What also makes the museum unusual is that it focuses on the Nazi perpetrators rather than their victims. One wall is full of file cards, detailing the identities of some of the former workers who were part of the Nazi killing machine �� from state prosecutors to members of the police force, the SS and Gestapo. Typically they were ambitious academics in their 30s who were keen to climb the career ladder.
"It's a reminder of just how young the National Socialist movement was," Nachama said.The exhibition illustrates how few of those involved were ever prosecuted or forced to answer for their roles. "We want people to leave us with more questions than they had when they arrived."
President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia would like the United States to remove the country�셲 largest rebel group from its list of terrorist organizations and suspend drug warrants against guerrilla commanders if he seals a peace deal to end the country�셲 five-decade civil war.
In an interview days before a key visit to the White House, Santos said that once a deal is signed it would be appropriate for the Obama administration to strike the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, from a State Department list of terrorist organizations where it has been included for almost two decades.The Farc, which as part of peace talks has already renounced kidnapping and declared a unilateral truce, has long demanded it be excluded.
�쏧f they sign it�셲 because we have a timetable for their disarmament and they have committed themselves to lay down their arms and make this transition to legal life. So I would say yes, I hope that they would be eliminated from the terror list,�� said Santos.
His 4 February meeting with President Barack Obama will celebrate 15 years and some $10bn in US counterinsurgency and anti-narcotics aid to its staunchest ally in the region.
The high-profile meeting underscores Colombia�셲 historic moment: the peace talks taking place in Cuba have reached what both sides describe as a point of no return, with a final deal to end a half century of bloodshed expected as early as March.This week the UN security council unanimously endorsed sending a mission to monitor an eventual accord, handing Santos a diplomatic victory as he tries to drum up funding for what he said will be a 10- to 15-year effort to recover vast parts of the country he says had been ceded by the state to illegal armed groups.
When pressed about how soon after the accord is inked should the Farc be removed from the US terror list, Santos said �쐔he shorter the better��. A Colombian paramilitary umbrella group had to wait a full six years after it completely disarmed to be removed.
In the same vein, he said he would like to see the US follow his lead in Colombia and suspend arrest warrants targeting the Farc�셲 top leadership, many of whom are negotiating in Havana.US federal prosecutors in a 2006 indictment accused 50 Farc leaders of supplying more than half of the world�셲 cocaine �� claims that Santos said were exaggerated and out of sync with commitments made at the negotiating table to abandon its involvement in the drug trade and help the government eradicate cocaine crops.
�쏛ny effort by the United States to allow us to apply transitional justice, for example by suspending the arrest warrants, would help us tremendously,�� he said.
Coca production skyrocketed 39% in 2014 and many experts say it will climb even further after Santos last year halted a US-backed aerial eradication campaign over health concerns.
He likened the Farc�셲 charging of a war tax on cocaine moving through territory it dominates to tactics used by the Irish Republican Army in its fight with Britain.
�쏷he way the IRA was robbing banks, the guerrillas were financing themselves from drug trafficking,�� he said.
But he warned that if guerrillas continue to enrich themselves through drugs all bets are off.
�쏬et�셲 be very clear: if they don�셳 behave, they�셪l be extradited,�� he said.
US officials have long insisted that only prosecutors can suspend the warrants. A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, declined to comment on Thursday.
Santos, a former defense and finance minister and the scion of the family that founded Colombia�셲 largest newspaper, described Colombia�셲 evolution from a near failed state when Plan Colombia began under President Bill Clinton into one of the world�셲 fastest-growing emerging markets with lower levels of conflict-linked violence.
As the country has stabilized, US aid has steadily declined from almost $1bn a year to about a third of that now. He said with a peace deal, demands for spending will surge as Colombia attempts to build roads, schools and extend the state�셲 reach to traditionally forsaken and economically unproductive areas.
He said he is optimistic that US aid to Colombia, which until now has had bipartisan support, will jump again and plans to discuss future funding with Obama. He will also meet with Republican leaders in Congress, some of whom have echoed criticisms by conservatives in Colombia that Santos is easing up on the war on drugs and being too lenient with the rebels behind scores of atrocities.
�쏞olombia is at a tipping point,�� Santos said. �쏧f we receive the help that we need, because we are in a difficult situation financially as is all of Latin America, we can take advantage of this new situation.��
In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state
 of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the
 American people.
We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on
 the ground - passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you
 please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.
We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past
 exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of
 blood, the saying of prayers - in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the
 decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.
My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of
 our Union - and it is strong.
Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief
 has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice,
 or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.
I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was
 touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined
 together on the steps of this Capitol, singing "God Bless America." And you did more
 than sing; you acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the
 needs of our military.
Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I
 thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our
 country.
And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of
 support. America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at
 Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.
We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul,
 or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of
 silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America.
Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of
 Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women
 from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens. America has
 no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a
 great cause - so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his
 unity of purpose with America. Thank you for coming, friend.
On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our
 country. Americans have known wars - but for the past 136 years, they have been wars
 on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of
 war - but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known
 surprise attacks - but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought
 upon us in a single day - and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself
 is under attack.
Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our
 country? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated
 terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are the same murderers indicted for
 bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the
 USS Cole.
Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its
 goal is remaking the world - and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.
The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by
 Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics - a fringe movement that
 perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill
 Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and
 civilians, including women and children.
This group and its leader - a person named Osama bin Laden - are linked to many
 other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the
 Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than
 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought
 to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They
 are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and
 destruction.
The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban
 regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda's vision for
 the world.
Afghanistan's people have been brutalized - many are starving and many have
 fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a
 television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in
 Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.
The United States respects the people of Afghanistan - after all, we are currently its
 largest source of humanitarian aid - but we condemn the Taliban
 regime. It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people
 everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting
 murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.
And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the
 Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your
 land. Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have
 unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your
 country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in
 Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to
 appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist
 training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.
These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban
 must act, and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in
 their fate.
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your
 faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in
 countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those
 who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The
 terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy
 of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy
 is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them.
Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until
 every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.
Americans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what we see right here in this
 chamber - a democratically elected government. Their leaders are
 self-appointed. They hate our freedoms - our freedom of religion, our freedom of
 speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.
They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt,
 Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to
 drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.
These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life. With
 every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and
 forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in their way.
We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They
 are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human
 life to serve their radical visions - by abandoning every value except the will to power -
 they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism. And they will follow
 that path all the way, to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.
Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every resource
 at our command - every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every
 instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of
 war - to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.
This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of
 territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years
 ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat.
Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans
 should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever
 seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even
 in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive
 them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations
 that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a
 decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From
 this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded
 by the United States as a hostile regime.
Our nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take
 defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of federal
 departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities
 affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So
 tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me - the
 Office of Homeland Security.
And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen
 American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted
 friend - Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee and coordinate a
 comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond
 to any attacks that may come.
These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our
 way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.
Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the
 reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all have our
 prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for
 our military: Be ready. I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason. The
 hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud.
This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is not just America's
 freedom. This is the world's fight. This is civilization's fight. This is the fight of all who
 believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.
We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces,
 intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The United States is
 grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded
 - with sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to
 Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the
 world: An attack on one is an attack on all.
The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes
 unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror, unanswered, can not
 only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And
 you know what - we're not going to allow it.
Americans are asking: What is expected of us? I ask you to live your lives, and hug
 your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and
 resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat.
I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come
 here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by
 them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of
 their ethnic background or religious faith.
I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your
 contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information,
 libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York,
 Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your
 cooperation, and I ask you to give it.
I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter
 security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle.
I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists
 attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is
 successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people. These
 were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our
 strengths today.
And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those
 in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help
 strengthen us for the journey ahead.
Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will
 do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for
 what you have already done and for what we will do together.
Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve
 air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights, and
 take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and
 keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency.
We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down
 terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence
 capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and find them before they
 strike.
We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy, and put
 our people back to work.
Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New
 Yorkers: Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As a
 symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two
 leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.
After all that has just passed - all the lives taken, and all the possibilities and hopes
 that died with them - it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some
 speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face. But
 this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States
 of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age
 of liberty, here and across the world.
Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and
 anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The
 advance of human freedom - the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of
 every time - now depends on us. Our nation - this generation - will lift a dark threat
 of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our
 efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not
 fail.
It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to
 normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief recedes
 with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what
 happened that day, and to whom it happened. We'll remember the moment the news
 came - where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire,
 or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.
And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at
 the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as
 a proud memorial to her son. This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that
 does not end.
I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it. I will not yield; I will
 not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American
 people.
The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear,
 justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral
 between them.
Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice - assured of the rightness of our
 cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant
 us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America.
A police commissioner has caused alarm among rank and file officers by suggesting that members of the public who own guns could help defend rural areas against terror attacks. Alison Hernandez, the Devon and Cornwall police and crime commissioner, said she was interested in having a conversation with the chief constable about whether ordinary people with gun licences could assist in a terrorist crisis.
The comments have caused alarm within the force and prompted a stern warning from a senior officer that citizens should not arm themselves.
Hernandez, a former Conservative election agent, made her comments during an extraordinary exchange with a caller to a phone-in programme on BBC Radio Cornwall. The caller, from Bude in north Cornwall, said she was a gun owner and a former firearms dealer and asked: �쏧f there should ever be a terrorist attack, what happens if I and other people try to defend themselves using those guns? What would be the repercussions?��
Hernandez replied that it was a �쏿 very good question�� and asked the woman if she would put it in writing so that the chief constable, Shaun Sawyer, could consider it. But she then added: �쏷his might be some of our solution to our issues.��
When challenged by presenter Laurence Reed if she was advocating vigilantism, Hernandez replied: �쏧�셫 just saying, let�셲 officially have a look at that and see what would be the implications of it. Let�셲 unpick it a little bit.
�쏻e work with businesses to keep our communities safe. I�셝 really be interested in exploring that with the chief constable.��
The presenter asked the caller if she would be happy taking on a terrorist. She replied: �쏽es,�� prompting Hernandez to remark: �쏶he�셲 not messing about. Don�셳 go down to Bude.�쒿he presenter said he could not believe the chief constable would entertain the idea of the public defending themselves with firearms. Hernandez replied: �쏧�셫 sure he wouldn�셳 want to entertain it, but these are times that are challenging and I would like to have an official response on that myself.��
The official response came swiftly from the deputy chief constable, Paul Netherton, who said: �쏲uite obviously, a marauding terrorist is the most challenging of circumstances. The police response requires significant professionalism and training as well as firearms capability. During these incidents, highly trained police firearms officers and special forces will be deployed to protect our communities.
�쏹nder no circumstances would we want members of the public to arm themselves with firearms, not least because officers responding would not know who the offenders were, and quite obviously they would not have the time to ask. Our message to the public is a simple one: to run, to hide and to tell.��
Rank and file officers also made it clear that they did not believe it was a good idea for members of the public to take up arms. Janice Adam, from the Police Federation, said reacting to and dealing with any such incidents should be left to highly specialised firearms officers. There was no reply from Hernandez�� office on Monday evening.
Eighty-four people died late on Thursday night as a lorry drove for more than a mile through the Bastille Day crowds in the southern French city of Nice. The driver eventually died in a hail of police bullets. The incident, on a day when the French celebrate equality, liberty and fraternity, could hardly be more horrific.
The victims are beyond help, but the French people should have whatever sympathy the world can usefully offer. The danger is that ritualised global responses to these incidents become their megaphone. They raise the multiplier impact of the terror �� and also raise public expectation that �쐓omething can be done��.
The French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, has extended for three months the state of emergency resulting from the Charlie Hebdo killings and the events in Paris last November. He has announced, yet again, that France is �쏿t war�� with the threat of Islamist terrorism.
A further 10,000 army reservists are to be deployed. �쏛ctivities will be strengthened�� in Iraq and Syria. In London and Washington counter-terrorism agencies are on alert, and President Obama is �쐀eing updated by his national security team��.
Such responses may comfort the citizens of Nice in their state of shock. But there is no defence force on Earth that can defend a crowd from a madman in a truck.
Since their invention at the end of the 19th century, motor vehicles have been agencies of terror and death. The first car bomb was �쏝uda�셲 wagon��, which blasted Wall Street in 1920. Cars and trucks are not going to be banned, any more than America is going to ban guns. The only sensible response is to accept the degree of risk that they will always pose, and not pretend it can be made to disappear.
Defence lobbyists have become adept at drawing strength from terrorist incidents, citing them in the cause of ever more money and advanced kit. It was grimly ironic that the Nice crowd had just watched an aerial display by France�셲 lavish force of jet fighters. They were as much use as peashooters in the �쐗ar�� that was subsequently unleashed on their onlookers �� as was France�셲 arsenal of nuclear missiles and aircraft carriers.
Hollande might more usefully have called up 10,000 psychologists or 10,000 Islamic historians. As for strengthening France�셲 role in the Islamist civil wars in Iraq and Syria, it is hard to imagine anything more likely to incite other young men to suicide attacks.
A Nice truck driver does not remotely threaten the security of the French state, any more than such acts do the security of America or Britain. The identification of the nation state with random killings of innocent people has become a political aberration.
The implication that leaders can somehow prevent such attacks by armed response is a total distraction from the intelligence and police work that might at least diminish their prevalence. It nationalises and institutionalises public alarm. It leads governments into madcap adventurism abroad and �쐓ecuritises�� the private lives of citizens at home.
What has happened in France is tragic and calls for human sympathy. Beyond that, there is nothing we can usefully do �� other than make matters worse.
Londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at Westminster, sharing messages of solidarity on social media.
#WeAreNotAfraid was trending in London as users reacted to the deaths of five people, including the attacker, on Wednesday and expressed gratitude and support for the work of emergency services.
Many vowed not to be cowed by terrorism.
Comedian and actor Margaret Cabourn-Smith characterised this tenor of the response, tweeting: ��#WeAreNotAfraid Or rather I am; but I�셫 damned if I�셫 going to let that stop me doing anything differently.
�쏮y heart goes out to all the people who went out this morning thinking it was gonna be �쁧ust another day��,�� tweeted one user with a photo of the British Gas advert, �쏻e are Londoners��.
Twitter user @HillyFoz shared a blurry nighttime snap of the London Eye, noting that the city had not been brought to a halt by the attack.
�쏬ondon�셲 just going about its business,�� she commented. �쏱ubs and theatres still full. Trains packed. Everyone looks a little sadder but #WeAreNotAfraid.��
Conservative party MP Will Quince echoed this resolve in quoting the UK Parliament�셲 tweet that confirmed that both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would sit on Thursday at their normal times.
He added: �쏛fter a tragic day in Westminster, our democracy continues tomorrow. Terrorism will never defeat us. #WeAreNotAfraid��
Many users shared a London Underground logo modified to bear the slogan �쏻e Are Not Afraid�� to demonstrate their defiance in the face of terror.
The message of solidarity extended across the world, with the Westminster attack occurring one year on from the terror attack in Brussels.
The Eiffel Tower�셲 lights were turned off at midnight in tribute to the victims of the attack.
Hen Mazzig, a former humanitarian officer with the Israeli defence force, tweeted an image showing the Tel Aviv city hall lit up as the Union Jack.
Video journalist Rav Vadgama�셲 message of resolve was on a far smaller scale, and stereotypically British: �쏯o place for terrorism, only tea. #WeAreNotAfraid��
Brussels has been blanketed with security after the Belgian government raised alert levels on terrorist threats to the maximum, warning of the �쐓erious and imminent�� possibility of a Paris-style attack involving firearms and explosives.
The city�셲 metro system was closed down on Saturday until Sunday afternoon at the earliest as shops shut, shopping malls were partly shuttered, professional football was cancelled, concerts were called off and music venues, museums, and galleries closed their doors for the weekend.
The heightened alert level followed meetings of the national security and counter-terror services late on Friday, which concluded, on the basis of undisclosed evidence, that a major attack was being planned in Brussels. The rest of the country was put on a level three alert, one level short of the maximum.
The measures are thought to have been implemented over fears that Salah Abdeslam is hiding in the Brussels area. The 26-year-old Frenchman is believed to be one of the ringleaders of the Paris attacks in which 130 people died last Friday. He has reportedly been in touch with friends on Skype asking for help in getting back to Syria.
�쏤ollowing a new assessment, the terror alert level has been raised to level four, very serious, for the Brussels region,�� said a government statement. �쏛nalysis shows a serious and imminent threat that requires taking specific security measures as well as specific recommendations for the public.��
People were told to avoid rail stations and airports, shopping centres, concerts, and other public events where people congregate.
�쏻e�셱e mobilising very strong security capacities,�� said Charles Michel, the prime minister. �쏷here�셲 a threat of attack by several individuals in several places. The [crisis centre] took this decision following information on a risk of attack similar to Paris.��
In sleet and the first freezing temperatures of the winter, the roads remained busy in a city known for traffic congestion. Local supermarkets were as busy as ever on a Saturday afternoon, open-air markets operated normally and were well-attended despite the weather and the worry.
There was however an edginess in the city�셲 central shopping area, with security personnel posted at the doors to shops checking bags and rucksacks on entry. Many shops and cafes lowered their shutters. By the afternoon, about half of city-centre shops had closed , while armoured personnel carriers restricted movement in the old city centre.
It is well-known that Belgium supplies by far the most foreign fighters to Syria compared to other EU countries in per capita terms and that Molenbeek is where they are concentrated. Jan Jambon, the interior minister and a Flemish nationalist, said that of 130 foreign fighters who were known to have come home from Syria, 85 were living in the small Brussels borough of Molenbeek just west of the city centre. He demanded that the local authorities conduct a �쐂oor-by-door�� vetting of who was living in every house and flat in the borough.
The mayors of Brussels�� 19 boroughs met at least twice and recommended a thorough lockdown of the city, not all of which was observed. A city centre mayor announced that a popular local market had been cancelled. In fact, it was operating as normal.
Municipal facilities across the city, such as sports and arts centres, libraries, and swimming pools, were all ordered to close. The Sunday morning market at the Gare du Midi, the Eurostar terminal �� one of the biggest outdoor markets in Europe �� was called off.
It appeared many of the cancellations and closures were meant to relieve pressure on the security forces who would be stretched too thin if mobilised to cover public events. Armed police as well as army personnel patrolled the central streets on foot, while police vehicles were ubiquitous.
Brussels is home to Nato headquarters and the US embassy in the city advised Americans to cancel their weekend plans.
�쏶helter in place and remain at home. If you must go out, avoid large crowds. US citizens are urged to avoid public places such as major pedestrian walkways and shopping centres. If you were planning to attend an event, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Exercise caution in public transportation systems, sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas, shopping malls and other tourist destinations.��
The Foreign office delivered similar advice for the high numbers of Britons in Brussels.
The words "terrorism" and "terrorists" were coined in the wake of the French revolution to describe the "men of blood" who established and exercised the mechanisms of fearsome repression �� the Revolutionary Tribunal, its Law of Suspects and the guillotine �� designed to conquer tyranny and secure liberty in the name of the sovereign people. "Liberty or Death", the Jacobins proudly proclaimed, before their club was closed. "Did you want a revolution without a revolution?" Robespierre sharply remarked.
In her provocative essay, Sophie Wahnich has new things to say about the difference between today's terrorists and their nominal 18th-century predecessors. She also offers a bold reconstruction of the emotions that drove the French revolutionaries to terror, reminding her readers that this particular period of history remains a political laboratory where it is possible to ask extreme questions about the causes and consequences of revolutionary violence. Her premise is that dismissive disgust at blood spilt and life lost is an edifying but overly simplistic and apolitical response to revolution past and present.
On the putative connection between the French revolution and the terrorists of 9/11 Wahnich is clear: "Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense." In her conclusion she reiterates the disjunction: "The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States."
According to Wahnich, there is an analogy to be drawn between 1793 and 2001, in the way the French revolutionaries and the Americans responded to "being in fear" by seeking common resistance to the enemy through anger, courage and justice. But here the analogy ends because, "the Americans, despite what they say, do not live in a time of foundation, and we have not finished observing the forms of dread that the American response has provoked �� the dread of a violence that is not foundational but policing, and recently also preventative."
The French revolutionaries, in contrast, did live at a time of foundation (of new political values), represented by the universal "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen", which, Wahnich argues, could not be secured without heroism in the face of profanation. On her account, the price of the Terror was "a sacred transaction in which the foundation of values required the death of men, in which body and soul had to be committed, and anyone could perish from fear or be overcome by disgust. This in my view is the forgotten price of the Revolution, the buried price of the Terror �� a price that is indissociably moral and political at once, and that lies in discomfort, risk and a gamble."
Wahnich is especially good at describing the fracturing of the revolutionary movement over the question of clemency. On the one hand, Danton �� "Since when is man infallible and exempt from error?" �� who could ask pardon on the scaffold for his role in establishing the institutions of the Terror. On the other hand, Saint Just, who asked for no forgiveness but pointed to the copy of the Declaration of Rights on the wall of the room in which he was held the night before his execution and said: "After all, I did that!" As for Robespierre, there is no way of knowing whether he had regrets about the price of the Terror, or thought the gamble had paid off. In the end he could not speak because half his jaw was shot off (by his own hand or another) and when he gestured for a pen, no one would give him one. But such had been his commitment of body and soul to the revolution, for good or ill, that regret seems unlikely.
Wahnich's essay contributes to and is informed by a reassertion of the left's historiographical grip on the revolution. In this story, the historian Fran챌ois Furet is the arch enemy, for stridently declaring on the eve of the bicentenary in 1989: "the French Revolution is over!" Furet's heirs are derided for focusing attention on the liberal constitutional aspirations of 1789, instead of the dark days of the Terror, which surely played a part in the founding of our western democracies.
An introduction by Slavoj 탐i탑ek ill-serves this book. Gushingly and flamboyantly welcoming �� "we were not waiting merely for a book like this; this is the book we were waiting for" �� he opens with Zhou Enlai's well-worn quip that "it is still too early to tell" what the French revolution has achieved. Then comes an anticapitalist rant that makes passing reference to a number of contemporary films. It is only in the last paragraph of his introduction that 탐i탑ek reminds himself to get "back to Wahnich's book". Finally, he issues some orders: "�� the reader should approach its topic �� terror and terrorism �� without ideological fears and taboos, as a crucial contribution not only to the history of the emancipatory movements but also as a reflection on our own predicament. Do not be afraid of its topic: the fear that prevents you from confronting it is the fear of freedom, of the price one has to pay for freedom."
Being frightened of terror and terrorism and refusing to think carefully and accurately about the topic are not the same thing. Nor is being frightened of terror and terrorism necessarily connected to the fear of freedom, or the price one might be made to pay for freedom in specific political circumstances. Many of the participants in the French revolution thought long and hard about such questions, and while it is sometimes difficult to understand their thoughts, and not always comfortable to do so, it is always interesting to go back into that perennial political laboratory and try. Wahnich's provocative book is testament to that.

Of all France�셲 great cities, none can rival Nice when it comes to conjuring up images of the sun-kissed good life.
With a stunning marina that draws in the wealthy yachting crowd, France�셲 fifth largest city enjoys an enviable position on the French Riviera not far from the millionaires�� playground of Monte Carlo and beautiful Juan-les-Pins, where Picasso and F Scott Fitzgerald held court. If, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, Paris is where good Americans go when they die, Nice must be reserved for the truly sainted.
But now the city�셲 reputation as an all-year-round holiday spot, attractive to both the easyJet set and boat-owning millionaires, is under threat. Away from its beaches, palm trees and swish hotels, the C척te d�섲zur has earned itself a new, unwelcome reputation: as a breeding ground for jihadis.
Disaffected youths in the region, many of them the children of Tunisian, Moroccan and Algerian immigrants, are drawn to the extreme Salafi strain of Islam promoted by charismatic preachers who denounce western decadence. After Paris, the Alpes-Maritimes area, of which Nice is the capital, is the leading hotspot for Islamist radicalisation in France. Analysis by the Economist suggests that the department has recorded 522 alerts about newly radicalised individuals.
Tensions in Nice have been threatening to spill over. In February a man attacked three soldiers with a knife outside a Jewish community centre, while two years ago the former mayor was accused of antagonising local Muslims. There have also been concerns about the opening of a new Salafi mosque. Now one unpalatable question facing Nice is whether Thursday�셲 atrocity will have a lasting impact on its image. In the short term, the city has had little choice but to forge a new, more subdued path for itself.
The Nice jazz festival, due to start on Saturday and featuring acts such as Massive Attack, has been cancelled. The singer Rihanna called off her concert there, too. But many tourists who were in the city when the attack happened have taken to social media, pledging that they will continue with their vacations. Those who have booked holidays on the C척te d�섲zur are also unlikely to change their plans, experts believe.
�쏰f those who have already booked their holidays, I think very few will cancel,�� says Frank Brehany, consumer director of Holiday Travel Watch, the holiday watchdog. �쏷his is partly because they will lose their money, but also because they will be reassured by the reaction of the French government in extending the national state of emergency.��
The extension will see a visible security presence, both in Nice and across France, continued for another three months. This will entail more police and soldiers on the streets, a graphic reminder to Britons, who make 17 million visits to France each year, that the country, according to the Foreign Office, faces a �쐆igh threat from terrorism��.
�쏛ttacks could be indiscriminate,�� the Foreign Office says. �쏡ue to continuing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as Isil), the French government has warned the public to be extra vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures.��
Visitors are being encouraged to download the free Saip smartphone app that alerts users, in French and English, about potential security incidents. But the app reportedly failed during the Bastille Day attack.
Brehany believes Nice will bounce back. �쏛s horrific as the Nice attack was, if you measure it against, say, Paris or Brussels, where there were multi-attacks, and both cities experienced lockdowns, there was a huge, immediate impact on tourism to both cities,�� he says. �쏝ut I was in Brussels recently and it was evident the changes they had made to security. I was in Paris a couple of weeks ago in the midst of the Euros [football championship] and you wouldn�셳 have thought there was any difference; there were huge crowds in the Gare du Nord. In the long term Nice will recover just as Paris and Brussels have done.��
Nevertheless Brehany says the Nice attack was a wake-up call for Europe�셲 tourist industry. �쏛fter Paris everyone came out with the phrase �쁶e must not give in to terror��, but I don�셳 know what that means,�� he says.
�쏻e really need to have a rethink about safety at our train stations, airports, ferry terminals and public spaces. One of the concerns I have is about the security of popular beaches following what happened in Tunisia last year.
�쏽ou cannot just simply offer a mantra in the hope that it will go away. You need to devise and, yes, spend money on the mechanics that make public spaces safe. You are not going to get rid of this thing, the randomness of these events, but you can, hopefully, move them away from more populated areas.��
It was once the most feared address in Berlin, a place easy to enter but very hard to leave. Now the ruins of the former engine room of Nazi terror at Prinz Albrecht Strasse in Berlin have been preserved in a new exhibition space open to the public from tomorrow.
Adolf Hitler's elite killers, the SS, the Gestapo secret police and the Reich Main Security Office ran their central operations from the site, making it the main cog in the Nazi regime.
"Our aim is to show the topography of how the Nazi-initiated terror was implemented and how both the Nazi party and state institutions merged together," said the director of the Topography of Terror museum, Andreas Nachama, a rabbi and historian. "It holds lessons about the workings of other dictatorships as well... The Pinochet dictatorship in Chile or the military junta in Argentina."
The monument is yet another piece in the puzzle of Germany's attempts to come to terms with its Nazi past and reinforces its reputation as a country which like no other has painstakingly documented its misdeeds.
It was from Prinz Albrecht Strasse that the concentration camps were administered, where the deadly military taskforces were managed and detailed records of regime opponents were kept. The Wannsee Protocol laying out the plan and execution of the Holocaust was also finalised in offices on the site, while in nearby prison cells thousands of people �� among them Jews, Roma and Nazi opponents �� were held and often tortured before being sent to concentration camps.
What makes the Topography of Terror different from many other memorials or museums in the city dedicated to victims of the Nazis, such as the huge Holocaust memorial next to the Brandenburg Gate, or the Jewish Museum designed by Daniel Libeskind, is that it is on an authentic site.
For years it has drawn tourists, attracting about half a million a year who have traipsed through a provisional subterranean exhibition in the cellars of former buildings and walked over some cracked paving stones. But now a new 짚25m, two-storey steel and glass rectangle, by architect Ursula Wilms, will house the grim history of this corner of Berlin.
Looming in front of the museum, you would have found the former Nazi air ministry of Hermann G철ring, (now the finance ministry), the former Prussian parliament building (now the Berlin MPs' house), and a strip of the Berlin Wall, which ran along the site's edge �� all of which have earned it the description of "most historically contaminated" site in a city heaving with reminders of its past. Its proximity to the wall helped save the site from demolition or redevelopment because for years, no one was much interested in it. Over the decades it served as a driving practise strip, a storage space for building materials and a dog walking scrubland, before a citizens' initiative started work on preserving it in 1987.
Deliberate efforts have been made to retain the scrubby look, as a reminder that it was neglected for years.
What also makes the museum unusual is that it focuses on the Nazi perpetrators rather than their victims. One wall is full of file cards, detailing the identities of some of the former workers who were part of the Nazi killing machine �� from state prosecutors to members of the police force, the SS and Gestapo. Typically they were ambitious academics in their 30s who were keen to climb the career ladder.
"It's a reminder of just how young the National Socialist movement was," Nachama said.The exhibition illustrates how few of those involved were ever prosecuted or forced to answer for their roles. "We want people to leave us with more questions than they had when they arrived."
As Britain comes to terms with the attack in Manchester, where 22 people have died after a blast at an Ariana Grande concert, here is a timeline of incidents in Britain in recent years:
Five people were killed when an Islamist extremist launched a car and knife attack in central London.
Khalid Masood drove a hired car over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament, mounted the pavement and hit pedestrians before crashing into railings outside the Palace of Westminster.
He stabbed PC Keith Palmer, 48, to death and also killed US tourist Kurt Cochran, Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31, plus Britons Aysha Frade, 44, and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes. Masood was shot dead by police.
Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered outside her constituency office in Batley, west Yorkshire.
The mother-of-two, 41, was shot and stabbed multiple times by rightwing extremist Thomas Mair. He was later handed a whole-life prison sentence for her murder.
A lone attacker attempted to behead a passenger during an Islamic State-inspired rampage in the ticket hall of Leytonstone Underground station in east London.
Somali-born Muhiddin Mire targeted strangers at random during the attack on 5 December 2015 before slashing fellow passenger Lyle Zimmerman, 56, with a knife.
Mire, who had schizophrenia, was sent to Broadmoor hospital after being given a life sentence with a minimum term of eight years for attempted murder.
The 25-year-old serviceman was walking near his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, when the pair rammed him with a car before attempting to decapitate him.
The killers were jailed for life at the Old Bailey in February 2014.
Two men inspired by Islamist extremism rammed a 4x4 laden with petrol and propane tanks into the main terminal of Glasgow airport. One of the attackers died in the incident and five people were injured.
Four suicide bombers killed 52 and injured hundreds in blasts on the London Underground network and a bus.
Twenty-six died in the bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line, six in the bombing at Edgware Road on the Circle line, seven in the bombing at Aldgate on the Circle line, and 13 in the bombing on a bus at Tavistock Square.
Six people have been killed and another 18 wounded after a gunmen opened fire at a mosque in Qu챕bec City, in an act condemned as a �쐔errorist attack�� by Canada�셲 prime minister.
More than 50 people were at the Qu챕bec City Islamic cultural center, also known as the Grande Mosqu챕e de Qu챕bec, for evening prayers on Sunday when shooting erupted in the two-storey building.
Two men have been arrested, but police later said that only one of them was considered a suspect. Initial reports suggested a third suspect was still on the run, but police said they were no longer looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting.
In a news conference on Monday morning, Qu챕bec province and city officials declined to provide any details about the two men who were arrested.
Qu챕bec City police inspector Denis Turcotte said that one of the menhad been arrested on the scene of the attack. The second was captured about an hour later after calling into 911 and identifying himself as involved, sharing his location with authorities and letting them know he was armed.
�쏯othing indicates to us that there was anyone else involved,�� said Martin Plante, a superintendent with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Plante added that the suspects were previously �쐕nknown�� to police.
Those who died ranged in age from 35 to 60. Another five people remain in hospital �� several of them in intensive care �� while 13 people have been released, according to a hospital spokesperson.
Speaking in parliament, prime minister Justin Trudeau said that the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, saying, �쏻e are with you.��
�쏷hirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,�� Trudeau said. �쏫now that we value you.��
Witnesses reported seeing the gunman dressed in black and wearing a ski mask walking into the mosque and opening fire. One watched as he began shooting at �쐃verything that was moving��, he told the Globe and Mail. �쏧t was someone who mastered weapons because it was calm �� He killed and he killed. It was really horrible.��
The witness, who was lying on the ground near the front of the mosque, said the gunman had emptied his weapon before leaving. �쏧�셫 shocked,�� he said. �쏻e thought that here, we were in a safe city, a safe country. But unfortunately, that�셲 not the case.��
Trudeau described the shooting as an act of terrorism. �쏻e condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge,�� he said in a statement. �쏻hile authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.��
Phillippe Couillard, the premier of Qu챕bec, described Sunday�셲 shooting as a �쐌urderous act directed at a specific community�� and said solidarity rallies would be held across Qu챕bec on Monday. �쏲u챕bec categorically rejects this barbaric violence.��
The shooting came amid protests and confusion around the world after Donald Trump enacted a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.
Asked if Trump�셲 actions influenced the attack, Couillard said no, but added: �쏻e are obviously in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite themselves��.
Trump called Trudeau on Monday to express his condolences and offer assistance.
The mosque�셲 president, Mohamed Yangui �� who was not inside the mosque when the shooting occurred �� said he had received frantic calls from people at evening prayers. �쏻hy is this happening here? This is barbaric,�� he said.
By Sunday night, city police said the site had been secured and all occupants evacuated. A large security cordon was set up around the site. Witnesses reported seeing heavily armed police entering the mosque after the shooting.
Fighting back tears at an early morning press conference, the city�셲 mayor, R챕gis Labeaume, said Qu챕bec was in mourning. �쏧 want to express my revolt to this villainous crime,�� he added. �쏷o the Muslim community, our neighbours, our co-citizens, who count on our support and solidarity, I want to say: we love you.�쒿he mosque has been targeted before. In June, a pig�셲 head was left there during the holy month of Ramadan. Weeks later, an Islamophobic letter was distributed in the vicinity.
Yangui told the Edmonton Journal the mosque had not received any threats recently. �쏻e have a very good relationship with the neighbours, with the community,�� he said. �쏷here�셲 mutual respect �� and now today we have this dramatic event.��
Across Canada and Qu챕bec, most are welcoming towards immigrants and religious diversity. But recent years have also seen Qu챕bec host a long-simmering debate over race and religious accommodation; in October, the province began parliamentary hearings on proposed legislation that would ban anyone wearing a face covering from receiving public services in the province.
Police said on Monday that security had been increased at all mosques across the province.
Many across Canada were still reeling from the heightened tensions in the US after Donald Trump�셲 travel ban.
Trudeau responded to the ban with a tweet: �쏷o those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.��
The tweet was followed by a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at the Toronto airport in 2015, one of nearly 40,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived in Canada in the past year.
The war on terror has inordinately affected Latino immigrants for the last 15 years, according to two sociologists who say Donald Trump has simply made explicit fears that long linked linked terrorism with anxieties about migrants and Muslims.
In a research paper presented on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Seattle, Lu챠s Romero and Amina Zarrugh, sociologists at the University of Texas at Austin, argued that since the attacks of September 11 2001, the US has increasingly merged terrorism and immigration in official policy and the daily work of its government agencies.
�쏷rump is articulating, in its most explicit terms, a connection that�셲 been insinuated and elaborated perhaps less colorfully and less explicitly, but that�셲 been going on for quite some time,�� Zarrugh said. �쏷he American public has been primed for these connections for at least a decade.��
She and Romero pored over 15 years�� worth of speeches and government documents to chart the merger and its effect on Latinos. Months after the attack, congressmen started warning of �쐏orous borders��, and years of false claims and alarming ads about terrorist activity at or near the border followed.
�쏷hey started framing almost any migrant at the US-Mexico border as a potential terrorist threat,�� Zarrugh said. �쏧n the past, the border was a place to stop drug trafficking and undocumented migration, but there became a surveillance-driven, militarized perspective of migrants as potential terrorists.��
That rhetoric became policy, she said, and �쐏olicy began to shape this �쁴s-versus-them�� sentiment in new ways��.
Lawmakers used national security proposals as vehicles for immigration laws, Romero added. �쏧t�셲 ironic to use the term Trojan horse,�� he said, �쐀ecause a lot of the rhetoric used against immigrants is about Trojan horses, of terrorist threats using immigrants to enter the US.��
Both researchers were quick to note that Muslims and south-west Asian people were unfairly targeted by much of the rhetoric and measures, though their paper studied the way �쐇rrational fear of Muslims has mapped on to immigration��, in Romero�셲 words. �쏧ncreased surveillance and security were an easy sell.��
None of the 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks on September 11 entered the country illegally, though three had overstayed their visas or violated their rules of stay. But alongside calls for surveillance of migrants, the newly created Department of Homeland Security soon absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and 21 other agencies.
�쏧n the 1930s, when INS was housed in the Department of Labor, immigration was a labor issue; when it moved to the Department of Justice, immigration was a legal issue,�� Romero and Zarrugh wrote in their paper.
�쏷he primary goal of the Department of Homeland Security is just that: security,�� Zarrugh said. �쏻e don�셳 often think of Islamophobia as affecting Latinos, but indirectly, through this emphasis on fearing for our safety, people are looking toward the border. And that has an impact on Latinos and others.��
The Patriot Act, passed by George W Bush, and two laws signed by Bill Clinton expanded the government�셲 deportation and detention powers. In 1996, Clinton himself admitted that one law targeted legal migrants, saying, it �쐌akes a number of major, ill-advised changes in immigration laws having nothing to do with fighting terrorism��.
Since the DHS was created in 2003, the US has deported an average of 334,000 people a year, far more than in any year before 2001. The Obama administration has deported more than 2.5 million people, including a record 438,421 people in 2013, when tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors fled north from violence in Central America. In July, the International Crisis Group declared the mass deportations a humanitarian crisis.
Advocates for immigrants agreed that terrorism fears have seeped deep into their work since 2001. �쏻hat I have seen over the past 15 years is that the government talks about national security in almost every case and gets far more traction with those arguments than they used to,�� said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU�셲 national Immigrants�� Rights Project.
Gelernt said the laws from 1996 greatly restricted what federal courts could review in immigration cases, causing �쏿n enormous impact for immigrants who are being erroneously deported.
�쏧t would have to be thousands of cases each year that are dismissed by the federal courts on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction.��
Gelernt said the government would make arguments about national security even in cases involving children. �쏷hese Central American women and children, to say they have any relation with terrorism or 9/11 is not correct, in my opinion,�� he said.
Allegations of abuse followed the expansion of executive and local power. In Arizona, a federal judge found that one sheriff had systematically violated Latino�셲 rights, and this week a lawsuit revealed cramped and harsh conditions at a detention center. Women and children have been detained for months, sometimes hunger striking to protest, and a fatal shooting of a Mexican teenager has led to the indictment of a border patrol agent.
�쏝order patrol agents are now trained as if to stop invasions, to see immigrants as a a menace to the country, without taking into account that immigrants may be fleeing violence and should be treated as refugees,�� said Marielena Hincapi챕, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.
Hincapi챕 said that, like Bush, Obama had treated immigration within the framework of national security, and perhaps failed to reform the system as a result. She also pointed to ID laws as another example of how post-9/11 laws had affected Latinos: her advocacy group saw an increase in national origin cases for Hispanic migrants and citizens.
�쏻e saw an increase in employer scrutiny,�� she said, �쏿nd again this conflation with, �쁚ou look foreign, you sound foreign, you might be a threat, so let me take an extra security step.�쇺��
The proposal for a wall along the southern border, taken up by Trump, has perhaps become the most visible symbol of the merged issues. But Zarrugh and Romero noted that justifications for a wall have changed over time: what began as a deterrent to migrants and drug traffickers near Tijuana has expanded into a border-length barricade against terrorists.
The Department of Homeland Security is also developing a fleet of surveillance drones, and the patrol agents use drones to patrol the border even though they have not proven cost effective. Last year, US representative Beto O�셊ourke of Texas protested the tactic, telling Politico: �쏷he defense industry is trying to �쁡efense-ify the border �� and treat it as a problem or a security threat that has a military-like solution.��
The pre-election edition of the Daily Mail devoted 13 pages to attacking Labour, Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell under the headline: �쏛pologists for terror.��
The tabloid urged readers to support the Conservatives in an editorial on its first and second pages but concentrated its fire on Labour�셲 leadership, compiling hostile anecdotes dating to the 1970s.
The Mail�셲 leading article said it had no doubt Corbyn�셲 �쐃xpressions of horror�� over the recent terrorists attacks in Britain were genuine, but added �쐔he ineluctable truth is that the Labour leader and his closest associates have spent their careers cosying up to those who hate our country, while pouring scorn on the police and security services and opposing anti-terror legislation over and over and over again��.
Other attack articles in the Mail included a collection of quotes from Corbyn, McDonnell and Abbott that the newspaper said was �쐏roof Corbyn and Co are unfit to rule��, a story headlined �쏳evealed: Labour plan to crash house prices�� and criticism of the BBC�셲 coverage of the election.
The Mail singled out Mishal Husain, who presents the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 and moderated a party leaders�� debate , for particular criticism. Husain �쐌ade little attempt to rein in the Corbynista mob in full cry and appeared out of her depth�� during the debate, Andrew Pierce wrote in the Mail.
Husain also adopted an �쏿ggressive, even menacing tone��, according to the tabloid during an interview with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, on the Today programme, Pierce added.
The Sun, which endorsed Theresa May and the Conservative party, ran a front-page story under the headline �쏪ezza�셲 Jihadi Comrades��. The newspaper reported that Corbyn had delivered an �쐇ncendiary speech�� at a demo that was attended by followers of the Islamic clerics Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri Muhammad.
In its editorial encouraging readers to vote for the Conservatives, the Sun said that Britain would be a �쐅lobal laughing stock�� if Corbyn was elected prime minister.
The newspaper, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch�셲 News Corp, said: �쏷his is not the moderate Labour of Tony Blair. It is not the Labour of Kinnock or even Miliband. Your vote would be to install Britain�셲 first Marxist government.
�쏛 generation after the end of the Soviet Union, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of almost every ruinous and oppressive hard-Left regime worldwide, you would be helping to establish a new one, right here in Britain. It would be the gravest mistake this country has ever made.��
Other press endorsements for the Conservatives came from the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Times. Labour has won the support of the Daily Mirror and the Guardian, with the Economist supporting the Liberal Democrats.
Commercially available drones have the potential to be converted into flying bombs capable of hitting targets such as nuclear power stations or the prime minister�셲 car, a report by a security thinktank has warned.
�쏡rones are a game changer in the wrong hands,�� warns the lead author of the report by the Oxford Research Group�셲 Remote Control project.
The report, The Hostile Use of Drones by Non-State Actors Against British Targets, highlights concerns that �쐂rones will be used as simple, affordable and effective airborne improvised explosive devices��.
It lists a range of potential targets including foreign embassies, nuclear power stations, a G7 summit or the prime minister�셲 car. �쏷he UK government, police, military and security services will need to introduce countermeasures to reduce or mitigate the risk of commercially available drones being used for attack,�� it reads.Recommended countermeasures include licensing drones, laser systems to protect targets, radio-frequency jammers, and clear guidance for the police and the army to shoot down hostile drones.
The study analysed more than 200 drones available to buy on the high street or on the internet and warns many are capable of being converted to deliver an explosive payload.
It also warns that the dangerous capabilities of drones are increasing and yet they are already being used by terrorists and activists. �쏷he technology of remote-control warfare is impossible to control,�� the report says.
It notes: �쏧slamic State [Isis] is reportedly obsessed with launching a synchronised multi-drone attack on large numbers of people in order to recreate the horrors of 9/11.�� The report points out that Isis is already using drones for reconnaissance in Iraq and Syria.
It also cites a number of recent examples of unauthorised use of drones that �쐓uggest scenarios for future lone wolf attacks��. These include:
Chris Abbott, the lead author of the report and visiting research fellow at Bradford University�셲 School of Social and International Studies, said: �쏷he use of drones for surveillance and attack is no longer the purview of state militaries alone. A range of terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate and activist groups have already shown their desire and ability to use drones against British targets.��
He added: �쏡rones are a game changer in the wrong hands. The government needs to take this threat seriously and commit to a range of countermeasures that still allow for legitimate commercial and personal use.��

The Flaming Lips have come a long way since 1999's unit-shifting The Soft Bulletin and 2006's At War With the Mystics, and all those happy-clappy, celebratory gigs featuring giant rubber hands and frontman Wayne Coyne in an inflatable globe. Returning to their experimental roots �� with knobs on �� The Terror sees their trademark pop melodies usurped by krautrock and a bleaker psychedelia, beams of sunlight replaced by enveloping gloom to create a melancholy odyssey. Band member Steven Drozd's substance abuse battles and Coyne's split with his partner after 25 years have influenced a mood which the singer describes as "embracing hopelessness". However, The Terror proves mesmeric rather than difficult. Guitar fragments, machines, mantras, spoken samples, echoes and drones are held together with some of the most killer hooks of their career. You Are Alone is sad but beautiful. There's no Do You Realize??-type grand anthem, but혻the brilliant, menacing, You Lust (which begins with Coyne's echoey threat, "You got a lot of nerve to fuck with me") and the desolate, lonely title track are as catchy as anything in the top 10.
Five London men were yesterday jailed under new anti-terrorist legislation for taking part in al-Qaida-style training camps in the New Forest and at paintballing sessions in the home counties. The sentences ranged between four years 11 months and three years five months. Their terrorist instructor, who dubbed himself "Osama bin London", and a preacher they recognised as their "amir", or leader, were convicted of soliciting to murder. Both will be sentenced next week.
Three of those jailed yesterday - Mohammed al-Figari, Kader Ahmed and Kibley da Costa - attended camps in Cumbria and a paintballing centre alongside most of those later convicted over the failed 21/7 attacks on the London transport system. The paintballing outing took place just over two weeks before the abortive bombing in 2005.
The five-month trial at Woolwich crown court was the first to test two new offences - introduced under the Terrorism Act 2006 - of providing training for terrorism and attending a place for the purpose of terrorist training.
The jury heard no evidence of weapons or explosives but listened to MI5 surveillance tapes and recordings made by a police officer who penetrated the London-based jihadist cell.
The conversations and films showed instructor Mohammed Hamid and his followers - Figari, Ahmed and Da Costa - performing what was alleged to be military training over a two-year period, initially at a farm in Cumbria and later at secluded sites in the New Forest and paintballing centres.
A fifth man, Atilla Ahmet - their "amir" and a close associate of the imprisoned Finsbury Park mosque preacher Abu Hamza - pleaded guilty at the begining of the trial to three counts of soliciting murder. Two others, Yassin Mutegombwa, 23, of Norwood, south-east London, and Mohammed Kyriacou, 19, of Kennington, south London, yesterday pleaded guilty to attending camps in the New Forest, in Hampshire, and paintballing centres in Berkshire for the purpose of terrorism training. Kyriacou also pleaded guilty to possessing information likely to be useful to terrorism.
The jury acquitted another man, Mousa Brown, 41, of Walthamstow, east London. None were found guilty of taking part in terrorist training at the Cumbria camps; those charges had been brought under older legislation. The verdicts returned last week could not be reported immediately until reporting restrictions were lifted.
Sentencing the men, Mr Justice Pitchers commended the bravery of the undercover officer, known only as Dawood, and said he believed the training had not been in order to commit atrocities in Britain.
"You are all here because of what you did, not because of what you thought," the judge added. "You did not intend to use those skills at the training camps in committing an act. [But] ... you cannot have been in any doubt from what was said at the meetings and in the form of the training activities that the underlying purpose of those camps was a sinister one."
Scores of potentially incriminating statements recorded during the police's Operation Overamp were played to the jury, including Hamid's reference to the death toll in the 7/7 attacks on London in 2005 when he said of the fatalities: "Fifty-two? That's not even a breakfast to me."
On the day of the attack, the court was told, Hamid had sent a text message to one of the 21/7 bombers, declaring: "Assalam bro we fear no one except Allah. We will not change our ways. We are proud to be Muslim and will not hide."
Attilla Ahmet, the group's preacher, was also heard to say in a reference to suicide bombs: "I just feel like packing it, walking it where it needs to be walked and then letting it go."
Hamid, Figari, Ahmed, and Da Costa had all denied the charges, insisting their activities were for fun and fitness. Ahmet did not appear in court for most of the proceedings.
Five of the defendants had arrived as young children in this country, fleeing poverty in the West Indies or conflicts in Africa. Four were recent converts to Islam. All had failed to build the prosperous new lives to which their parents aspired.
Hamid, a reformed crack addict, was the pivotal figure, the prosecution said, turning young Muslims into jihad extremists.
Attending a place for the purpose of terrorism training carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. Da Costa, who was also convicted of providing training, was sentenced to four years and 11 months in jail; Ahmed received three years and eight months in a young offenders' institution; Figari was imprisoned for four years and two months; Mutegombwa three years and five months in prison; and Kyraciou three years and five months in a young offenders' institution.

Martin McCauley and Michael Tighe were country boys. They grew up a stone�셲 throw from each other, on smallholdings that sat on opposite sides of a narrow, hedge-lined lane. Derrymacash, the Northern Irish village where they went to school and played Gaelic football, was a mile away. Beyond that lay the expansive waters of Lough Neagh. The boys helped out on each other�셲 family farms: in the summer they cut and baled hay together; in the winter they rode tractors. In the summer of 1982 they had bought a motorbike, a scrambler, to tear across the bogs of north Antrim and perform wheelies along the local boreens.
On 24 November that year, a Wednesday, Tighe spent most of the day on his parents�� smallholding, looking after the pigs. At the end of the afternoon, as the light was about to fade, McCauley kickstarted their bike and they rode it to an empty redbrick bungalow about half a mile away. They parked up and went into a ramshackle hayshed at the back of the house.
The first two bullets came through the window. The boys had heard no sound, no hint whatsoever that anyone had crept up to the front of the hayshed; just two very loud bangs. Tighe, who was sitting on a stack of hay bales, toppled backwards. McCauley, standing next to the window, froze. �쏯ext thing, the whole of the wooden doors to the barn exploded inwards,�� he recalled. �쏷hey just machine-gunned it. I was standing up and trying to press myself against a hay bale, but I couldn�셳 get any cover. So I crouched down and tried to move backwards across the doorway. I was trying to get out of the way like this,�� he said, shuffling backwards to demonstrate. �쏧t was like everything had slowed down. I don�셳 know where I was hit first. One of the shots hit me in the back of my left shoulder and exited through my throat. Look: you can still see where it came out. Another hit me around the top of my spine and exited through my right armpit. The third hit me in my right thigh near the groin and came out of the outside of my thigh.
�쏶omeone came into the hayshed and hit me on the back of my head, and I was dragged through what was left of the doors. The pain was just excruciating. The best way that I can describe being shot is that it�셲 like someone walked up to you and hit you with a red-hot sledgehammer. I was just lying there. And with every heartbeat the blood was pumping up in the air from my thigh.�� A man pointed a rifle at his head and threatened to finish him off. He thought he was going to die. Tighe was out of sight, behind the hay bales. �쏧 didn�셳 know it then, but Mickey was dead. He�셝 been shot twice in the heart.��
McCauley was 19, an alleged IRA volunteer and bomb-maker: a suspected killer. Tighe, one of six children, was �쏿 fresh-faced lad of simple needs��, with no involvement in the conflict, according to the subsequent assessment of a senior policeman. He was 17. His killing brought Northern Ireland�셲 death toll to 2,487. But Michael Tighe�셲 death was different, because the shots that killed him, and the subsequent cover�몍p, were part of a dark episode in the undeclared war in the north, in which it was possible to glimpse the British state fighting terror with terror.
The battle to establish the truth about what happened in the hayshed has dragged on for three decades �� a subplot in the wider tragedy of the Troubles. But some of the details of that afternoon are only now starting to emerge. Two highly classified reports by senior policemen, John Stalker and Colin Sampson �� which have never been released to the public �� concluded that senior Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) detectives and MI5 officers were involved in a conspiracy to suppress the truth about Tighe�셲 killing. Sampson�셲 report, portions of which the Guardian has seen, is particularly critical of MI5, describing the agency�셲 conduct as �쐒eprehensible�� and �쐏atently dishonest��.
Next year, after 34 years, inquests will finally be held into the deaths of Tighe and five other men, all of whom were killed within a few weeks not far from the hayshed. Northern Ireland may have been largely at peace for almost two decades, but it is a peace that remains haunted; even the dead, it seems, cannot lie down to sleep.
One afternoon in late October 1982, four weeks before the shootings at the hayshed, the police received a call, claiming that someone had been prowling around the farms that line the southern shore of the lough and had stolen a battery from a tractor; three officers were despatched to make inquiries. Travelling in an armoured Ford Cortina, they made their way along a route leading to the M1 motorway, a straight stretch of road known locally as Kinnego embankment. The IRA had built an enormous bomb inside a culvert under the road, and when it was detonated by a control wire, the Cortina was hurled 70ft in the air. All three officers were killed instantly. One was 26 and had been married for a month; the other two had five children between them.
Jack Hermon, the chief constable of the RUC, was driving nearby with his wife. �쏻e stopped momentarily at a roundabout,�� he wrote in his memoirs. �쏛s we did so, we heard the explosion, and our driver pointed to the smoke and debris erupting on the skyline.�� The blast left a crater 15ft deep and 40ft wide. The killing of the three policemen was not merely distressing for their fellow officers �� it was maddening. The home-made explosives used in the bomb were supposed to have been under surveillance.
Several weeks earlier, an informer within the ranks of the local IRA had contacted his handlers from special branch, the intelligence-gathering unit of the RUC, and told them that around 1,000lb of explosives had been smuggled across the border from the Irish Republic. It was being stored in a hayshed near Derrymacash, 10 minutes�� drive from Kinnego. The informer identified three local men as members of an IRA unit that was planning to carry out a bomb attack. Two of them, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns, were 21 and from the nearby town of Lurgan. The third, the informer said, was Martin McCauley.
The farmland in that corner of north Armagh is relentlessly flat, and there was not much woodland cover nearby, so a decision was taken that the hayshed should not be watched. Instead, an MI5 technician, accompanied by a British special forces soldier, broke in and wired a microphone into the rafters, and installed a movement sensor beneath the black plastic bags containing the explosives. The devices were monitored by both British soldiers and RUC officers, at an army post a few miles away, and the transmissions were tape recorded.
Somehow, the IRA had managed to remove the explosives from the hayshed without the army monitors hearing anything, and had used them to construct the bomb that killed the three police officers at Kinnego.
Fifteen days later, Toman and Burns were dead, along with a third local IRA member, Toman�셲 cousin Gervaise McKerr, a 31-year-old joiner and father of two small boys. All three were shot by an RUC squad called the Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU), which had been trained by the SAS regiment in what subsequent court evidence would describe as �쐄irepower, speed and aggression��, and operated under the control of special branch. The RUC issued a press statement, saying that the three men had been travelling in a car that tried to run over a policeman at a roadblock on the outskirts of Lurgan. �쏛s he attempted to throw himself out of its path, he was struck by the car and injured,�� the statement said. �쏰ther police opened fire on the vehicle which drove on in an attempt to escape.�� All three men were killed. The policemen who was struck by the car was not seriously hurt.
The shooting happened so close to McKerr�셲 home that his family could hear it while watching Top of the Pops on television. Eddy Grant was singing I Don�셳 Wanna Dance, while outside the sound of the shooting went on and on. None of the three men who died had been armed. McKerr and his wife Eleanor had been considering emigrating to Canada. �쏦ow different life would have been,�� she later wrote. McCauley heard the news at his parents�� home. It was not long before local musicians were singing a rebel song: �쏷he three lie in a soldiers�� grave in a churchyard near the town �╈��
Thirteen days after that, Tighe and McCauley were shot in the hayshed by members of the same small police unit. The RUC press release said that a patrol had noticed an armed man enter the shed and decided to investigate. �쏷hey were confronted by two men armed with rifles. Police opened fire and the two gunmen were hit. One man died at the scene and the other, who was seriously injured, was taken to Craigavon hospital.�� The statement added that three rifles were found at the scene and the search was continuing. No mention was made of any listening devices or movement sensors, nor of the soldiers who were monitoring the shed from the listening post.
At Craigavon hospital, McCauley underwent emergency surgery. After being wheeled out of theatre he was arrested and charged with possession of three rifles that were recovered from the hayshed. He was also told that his friend was dead. McCauley watched news coverage of the funeral on television in an intensive care ward. �쏧t was a massive funeral. It seemed unreal, watching the family and our friends and neighbours walk behind Mickey�셲 coffin.�� Then he was transferred to a secure unit at a hospital in Belfast, where doctors decided he needed nerve grafts to repair damage to his right arm.
Eighteen days after the shooting at the hayshed, two more men were shot dead by officers of the HMSU, this time in Armagh, south-west of Belfast. Like the men shot dead in Lurgan, Seamus Grew, 30, and Roddy Carroll, 21, were terrorists: members of the Irish National Liberation Army. They were also unarmed. The subsequent RUC press statement was unusually detailed. It said that the two men had been in a car that had driven through a police checkpoint, and that the vehicle had been chased �쏿t speed�쇺�� before being forced to a halt. �쏷he driver jumped out of the vehicle and the police, believing they were about to be fired on, themselves opened fire. Both occupants were shot.��
There were a number of problems with the police statements about these three incidents �� the principal one being that they were untrue.
In both London and Dublin, ministers and officials had hoped that 1982 would offer some respite after the turmoil that followed the hunger strikes of the previous year; a year in which some political progress might be made in the north. Unemployment was rising sharply, however, and by the end of the year more than one in four men were out of work. And the bombings and shootings continued.
By the time of the deaths of Carroll and Grew, many nationalists in Northern Ireland were enraged by the killings, and senior members of the Roman Catholic clergy were demanding an independent inquiry. Sinn Fein accused the police of carrying out summary executions. The suspicion grew that the RUC was running some sort of a death squad. Few people were prepared to use such a term, however: instead, someone coined the ambiguous phrase �쐓hoot-to-kill��. Northern Ireland secretary Jim Prior immediately denied there was any �쐓hoot-to-kill policy��. There was, he said, �쏿 policy of capturing and dealing with terrorists��, but he added that if people who were suspected of being armed broke through a roadblock, �쐔hey must accept the security forces have to take the necessary action��.
In June the following year, as a result of pressure from the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the RUC conducted fresh investigations into the two shootings. Eventually three members of the HMSU were charged with the murder of Eugene Toman, who had been shot by a constable named David Brannigan.
When they went on trial in May 1984, the three men insisted that they had believed their lives to be in danger when they opened fire. The judge, Lord Justice Gibson, sitting with no jury, accepted their defence. Announcing his verdict, Gibson said he believed the officers to be �쏿bsolutely blameless��, adding: �쏷hat finding should be put on their record along with my own commendation as to their courage and determination for bringing the three deceased men to justice, in this case, to the final court of justice.��
A fourth police officer, Constable John Robinson, was charged with the murder of Grew. Like a number of other members of the HMSU, Robinson was English and a former soldier. The prosecution case was that he had emptied his pistol into Carroll from a few feet, reloaded, walked around the car to where Grew was climbing out, and shot him from a distance of a few inches. It emerged during the trial that Grew and Carroll were thought to have been in contact with the INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey �� who was believed to have ordered the bombing of a disco in a pub near Derry a few days earlier, in which 11 soldiers and six civilians had died. The police had information that McGlinchey, the man the popular press dubbed �쏮ad Dog��, would be in that car with Grew and Carroll.
Although Robinson was cleared on the same grounds as his colleagues �� that he believed his life to be in danger �� his trial did not run smoothly. He admitted in court that he had not told the truth when interviewed by detectives investigating the shooting. He told the judge that senior officers had ordered him to give a false account in order to conceal that the dead men had been under surveillance by an army unit, and also to hide the fact that intelligence about them had been supplied by a special branch informer. Furthermore, Robinson said, there had been no roadblock, and no high-speed chase.
As a consequence of Robinson�셲 admissions, the RUC was compelled to request an investigation by an outside force. John Stalker, the deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester police, agreed at the end of May 1984 to examine all six deaths. Nobody at special branch said a word to Stalker about the Kinnego embankment bombing, informers, or electronic surveillance. But he and his team soon began to work it out. He established that Toman, Burns and McKerr, like Grew and Carroll, had been followed before they died. He realised that no attempt had been made to halt the green Ford Escort in which the first three men were travelling, and no policeman had been struck by it. The officers of the HMSU had chased the car for 500 yards while firing 108 shots at its occupants. They had then been ordered to leave the scene while special branch detectives removed many of the cartridge cases. When investigators from the police Criminal Investigation Department arrived, they examined the wrong location.
Stalker also found that the members of the headquarters mobile support unit had been told to give false accounts to investigating detectives �� based on press releases that had been prepared before the shootings, in order to provide a response to the inevitable questions from journalists. These accounts were then slightly tweaked to fit in with the events as they had unfolded. The same measures had been taken before Grew and Carroll were shot dead.
When McCauley went on trial in early February 1985, charged with possessing the three rifles found at the hayshed, Stalker sat in on the proceedings. Between hearings he chatted with McCauley�셲 solicitor, Pat Finucane, much to the anger of watching RUC officers, who told Stalker that they regarded Finucane, who had represented many people accused of being republican terrorists, as being �쐗orse than an IRA man��. McCauley told the court he had been looking after the property for the elderly woman who owned it, and had climbed through an open window when he saw the rifles inside. They were heavily rusted Mausers of pre-second world war vintage. There was no ammunition. When the police who shot the two teenagers gave evidence, they admitted their superiors had presented them with a false story to explain why they had gone to the building (they had not seen an armed man in the vicinity), but insisted they had opened fire after shouting two warnings �� �쏱olice, throw out your weapons!�� �� and only when the pair pointed the rifles in their direction. The trial judge decided the police officers�� evidence was so unreliable that he would need to discount it completely. But he concluded that McCauley was also lying, and gave him a two-year prison sentence, suspended for three years.
In his report on the affair, which has remained secret for 30 years, Stalker described how the regional head of the CID, the police department that investigates serious crime, had arrived at the hayshed after the shooting only to be told by a more junior special branch officer that �쐔he scene of the incident was out of bounds�� to CID. �쏳esignedly, he had a meal at Lurgan police station before arriving at the scene about one and a half hours after the incident had occurred,�� Stalker reported. The senior detective could see special branch were busy at the hayshed, but chose not to question their presence as he knew he would not be enlightened. �쏧f this were an isolated instance I might accept it as partly understandable,�� Stalker wrote in his report, �쐀ut the same thread of special branch paramountcy runs through all the incidents. Such a situation does not develop overnight and must, it seems to me, have high-level endorsement.��
Stalker discovered that the informant who had told special branch about the explosives at the hayshed had also provided information about Toman, Burns, McKerr and McCauley. He suspected that this man was not only an informer, but an agent provocateur, who had planted the old rifles at the hayshed. The surveillance was being maintained, and anyone who went to take the weapons was liable to be attacked. Stalker also found out how much money was being paid to this spy inside the IRA: it amounted to many thousands of pounds. But he never discovered the informer�셲 identity, and nor did anyone else outside a tight group of special branch detectives and MI5 officers. In Derrymacash, suspicion fixed upon an individual close to young Michael Tighe�셲 family, a man who vanished around the time Stalker began making his inquiries, and who has never been seen since.
Stalker began to think that special branch, supported by MI5, might be using informants to lure terrorism suspects into pre-planned ambushes, mounted by police officers who were indeed shooting to kill.
Stalker had been on the case about six months before he learned that the events at the hayshed in November 1982 had been recorded. There was a sequence of tapes from the listening device, and the key tape �� which captured the moment when the police opened fire �� was known as Tape 042. There could be no better piece of evidence in the quest to establish whether or not some sort of shoot-to-kill policy had been operating: if a warning had been shouted it would have been audible on the tape; if not, it would be possible that the two young men had been ambushed.
In the book about the affair that he later published, Stalker wrote: �쏧 passionately believe that if a police force of the United Kingdom could, in cold blood, kill a 17-year-old youth with no terrorist or criminal convictions, and then plot to hide the evidence from a senior policeman deputed to investigate it, then the shame belonged to us all. This is the act of a police force out of control.�� Stalker was wrong, in this respect. The RUC and its HMSU were not out of control: far from it.
Stalker was aware, when he arrived in Northern Ireland, that he was investigating members of a police force that faced unique challenges. By the time of the Kinnego embankment bombing, 168 RUC officers had lost their lives. He also appreciated that the intelligence-gathering activities of special branch played an indispensable role in the RUC�셲 operations. What he had not been told was that a strategy �� devised by MI5 and adopted by the RUC in complete secrecy �� had prioritised the acquisition of intelligence over the solving of crime and the prosecution of offenders, in a way that utterly transformed policing tactics in Northern Ireland.
Stalker had not been informed that, within days of being appointed chief constable of the RUC in January 1980, Jack Hermon had asked MI5 to examine the role of intelligence-gathering in police operations. The study was conducted by Patrick Walker, a senior MI5 officer in Northern Ireland, who would go on to become director general of the agency in 1987. Today, the Walker report remains a state secret, but the confidential police instruction that was issued to senior CID officers, ordering them to implement its key recommendations, has surfaced. Dated 23 February 1981, this document makes clear that Hermon had accepted that the recruitment of agents from within the ranks of the paramilitary organisations should take priority over the solving of individual crimes; that CID should arrest no one without first consulting special branch, in order to avoid the inadvertent detention of such agents; and that the requirements of special branch and MI5 should take precedence over the work of the CID.
Knowing nothing of the existence of the Walker report, and the way in which it was guiding counter-terrorism tactics, Stalker decided that he should pursue the recording from the hayshed. And having made his decision, Tape 042 became an obsession.
Martin McCauley, meanwhile, was still making sense of the extensive covert surveillance operation that had been disclosed at his trial. �쏧t never occurred to us at that time that they could bug buildings,�� he said earlier this year. �쏻e were country people: we didn�셳 even have a telephone.�� People in north Armagh began to speculate that there could be dozens of such listening devices in place, in the Lurgan area alone. They may well have been correct. But McCauley was not surprised that Tape 042 was not played in court. �쏧f they had been telling the truth about the shooting they could have just played the tape straight away in court. But they couldn�셳 do that because they would have been up for murder.�� Returning to Derrymacash, he was repeatedly stopped and questioned by police, and followed, he said, by men he recognised to be off-duty members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, the locally recruited British army unit. He found work as an engineer, married his girlfriend, Crist챠n, and the first of their three children was born. But facing what he describes as harassment, the couple moved south of the border, to what they call the Free State. They settled first in Kildare �� �쐗e chose it with a pin in a map�� �� and then Monaghan.
Life was not so very different down south. The special branch of the Garda S챠och찼na were frequent visitors to the McCauleys�� home. �쏷he guards were even worse than the RUC,�� McCauley said. On one occasion an officer pointed a handgun at his head. On another, the couple were shocked �� as Irish republicans residing in the Irish Republic �� by a guard detective�셲 brusque suggestion: �쏻hy don�셳 you fuck off back to Thatcherland?�� Crist챠n laughs and shakes her head. �쏷hat was so insulting on so many levels.��
The war in the north dragged on. Lord Justice Gibson, the judge who had commended the men of the HMSU for having brought Toman, Burns and McKerr to �쐔he final court of justice��, was murdered in April 1987. The IRA concealed a 500lb bomb inside a car and detonated it as Gibson drove past, then issued a statement in which they condemned the judge for supporting �쏳UC executioners�� and said that he too had been brought to the �쐄inal court of justice��. His wife Cecily died alongside him. Two years later, McCauley�셲 solicitor, Pat Finucane, was shot dead in front of his wife and children. Four years after that, David Brannigan, the police officer who had shot dead Eugene Toman �� and who believed he had been hung out to dry by his superiors �� shot himself.
Over the years, McCauley continued to be arrested and questioned on both sides of the border. He believes that this happened four or five times, but he can no longer recall for certain. Crist챠n was arrested once. The authorities in both countries had come to the conclusion that her husband was an expert in the construction of home-made mortars as well as bombs. In February 1991, at the height of the Gulf war, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet as it met in Downing Street, firing three home-made mortars from a van parked a few hundred yards away in Whitehall. One shell exploded in the rear garden of Number 10, injuring four people. McCauley, who was in Ireland at the time, was immediately picked up for questioning. The following month the family moved back north, to Lurgan, where McCauley engaged another well-known lawyer, Rosemary Nelson. They stayed in the town for seven years, until April 1998, when someone left a pipe bomb outside their front door. They packed their bags again and moved back to Kildare. The following week the Good Friday agreement brought the conflict largely, but not completely, to an end: the following year, Rosemary Nelson was killed by a car bomb.
Stalker, meanwhile, having made his decision, pursued Tape 042 with the utmost vigour. He wanted not only the transcript of the recording, but the tape itself, and the logbooks that recorded where it had been stored and who had listened to it. The RUC refused to hand over this material, and after much stalling, Hermon told Stalker it belonged to MI5. Stalker later recounted that MI5 had agreed that he should be given the tape, but Chief Constable Hermon still refused. Hermon began avoiding Stalker and failed to return his calls.
After eight months of this, at a meeting at MI5 headquarters in June 1985, Stalker had been told by the head of the agency�셲 operations in Northern Ireland that MI5 would never stand in the way of a murder investigation and that it would hand over all the information in its possession. No material was produced, then or later.
Stalker submitted an interim report in September 1985, in which he said there was enough evidence to indicate that the five men shot dead in their cars were unlawfully killed by police officers. He also made clear that he was going to continue his search for evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy.
Later that month, police in the north-west of England opened a criminal inquiry into one of his friends, Kevin Taylor, a successful Manchester businessman. Shortly after that, Stalker too came under investigation. In a widely publicised scandal, Stalker was suspended from duty and accused of consorting with criminals. The allegation was that Taylor had links with gangsters, known locally as the Quality Street gang, and that Stalker had attended social events with a number of them. Stalker was adamant that this was a pretext to remove him from the shoot-to-kill inquiry. It was not until August 1986 that Stalker was fully exonerated and returned to work. When it emerged that his efforts to defend himself had resulted in a 짙22,000 legal bill �� and that the police were expecting him to pay it himself �� donations from the public began to arrive at his office. Stalker left the police service for good in 1987. He had devoted two years of his life to his inquiry, and concluded that he had failed.
Stalker�셲 friend Taylor was subjected to a four-year police investigation which resulted in him being charged with fraud, but when the case came to trial, the prosecution withdrew. When he sued Manchester police, alleging it had been guilty of malicious prosecution, the force settled out of court for a sum in excess of 짙1m.
In the meantime, Colin Sampson, the chief constable of West Yorkshire, had agreed to take over the shoot-to-kill inquiry. He produced three reports, all of which were classified and not one of which led to any prosecutions. In January 1988 the attorney general, Sir Patrick Mayhew, told the House of Commons that the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland had concluded that there was no new evidence to warrant further prosecutions. Seamus Mallon, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Newry and Armagh, pointed out that no inquests had been held, and added: �쏮ake no mistake about it, justice has been dispensed with in this statement to cover up the murky and illegal methods of MI5 and MI6, and the darker elements within the RUC.�� Mayhew responded that �쐇nquests will, of course, be held in due course��.
That was more than 27 years ago, and the shoot-to-kill inquests have not been held. They were opened and adjourned in 1983, and reopened after Sampson submitted his reports in 1987. Eventually, the local coroner, who was charged with examining the deaths, gave up. As recently as last December, the coroner �� the fifth to attempt to preside over the hearings �� was complaining furiously that police had still not handed over relevant material.
During all those years, while English detectives were struggling to make sense of the dirty war, Martin McCauley had not been idle. In the summer of 2001 he turned up in Colombia. He was arrested at Bogot찼 airport as he attempted to leave the country on a false passport. With him were Niall Connolly, a Sinn Fein official who lived in Cuba �� the republican movement�셲 man in Havana �� and James Monaghan, an alleged leader of the IRA�셲 engineering department. �쏮onaghan is to the Provisional IRA,�� the Guardian reported, �쐗hat the fictional �쁐�� was to James Bond and the British Secret Service �� an improvisational genius in the technology of killing��.
The Colombian government said it had evidence that the three men had trained the Marxist Farc guerrilla army in the construction and use of home-made mortars that fired gas cylinder bombs. They were the sort of weapon the IRA had been developing in Northern Ireland since the early 70s, and had deployed in the attack on Downing Street. McCauley was said to have been travelling to and from Colombia since 1998. The following year Farc used a number of the weapons during fighting in the town of Bojay찼 in the west of the country. One mortar bomb crashed through the roof of a church where hundreds of civilians were sheltering. At least 79 people were killed, around a third of them children.
The exposure of the links between the Provisionals and a militia denounced in Washington DC as a gang of �쐍arco-terrorists��, three years after the Good Friday agreement, was deeply embarrassing for the IRA. The three Irishmen denied the allegations against them. After a trial that dragged on for eight months they were convicted of passport offences but cleared of training the Farc, and set free. They went into hiding, with the result that when the prosecution appealed and a judge overturned the acquittals and sentenced all three to 17 years in jail, he was obliged to do so in their absence. Eight months later, in August 2005, the three men resurfaced in Ireland. Today McCauley is reluctant to say anything whatsoever about his South American adventure, at one point joking that he was never in Colombia. �쏧 was!�� Crist챠n piped up.
The McCauleys have settled down in a terraced house on the edge of Naas, the county town of Kildare. Now 52, McCauley works as a mechanic. He rises at five each morning and spends most of his working day outdoors. He will not admit that he was a member of the IRA �� to do so would be to invite prosecution �� but some parts of his history are an open book. There is no extradition arrangement between Colombia and the Republic of Ireland, but the British government has made clear that he will be arrested and extradited if he crosses the border to the north.
McCauley, who is now a grandfather, looked worn-out when I met with him. Crist챠n said this is because he works so hard. Asked whether he supported the peace process, his response �� �쏽es!�� �� was delivered before the question is finished. Peace could not have come a moment too soon for McCauley. When he talked about the shooting at the hayshed he became visibly agitated. His speech was rapid, he grimaced slightly and he began to squirm; he could not sit still. He has never sought counselling �� not because he did not believe he needed it, but because he could never trust a counsellor. �쏷hat�셲 the way it was, you could never trust anyone.�� He talked about placing memories to one side; putting things behind him. �쏷hat�셲 it: you have to close doors.��
One matter that McCauley did not put behind him was his conviction for possession of the rusted Mauser rifles that were recovered from the hayshed. In late 2005, after his return from Colombia, he asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the UK body responsible for the examination of alleged miscarriages of justice, to look again at the case. The commission examined the evidence and referred McCauley�셲 firearms conviction to the Northern Ireland court of appeal.
The current DPP of Northern Ireland decided that McCauley�셲 appeal should not be opposed. Stalker and Sampson�셲 reports remain unpublished, but key sections emerged in McCauley�셲 case and they make sober reading, even three decades after they were written. Stalker�셲 report concluded that there was �쏿mple evidence�� that three senior special branch officers �� whose names have been redacted in the copy of the report seen by the Guardian �� had conspired to pervert the course of justice and should be prosecuted.
Sampson �� who faced accusations that he had been brought in to preside over a whitewash �� wrote a report that was even more forceful. He had discovered that at the very moment MI5 had been telling Stalker that it would never stand in the way of a murder investigation, and as he struggled to get hold of a copy of Tape 042, the agency was in possession of its own bootleg copy of the recording. The language of Sampson�셲 report betrays the anger and contempt that he clearly felt on making this discovery. �쏷he fact that the security service was in possession of and retained the copy tape until the early summer of 1985 and did not bring it to the attention of Mr Stalker is wholly reprehensible,�� he wrote. �쏷here can be no doubt that the unauthorised copy tape held by the security service was of great significance to the Stalker enquiry. A number of senior Security Service Officers, each with a varying degree of knowledge of the tape, had more than one meeting with Mr Stalker when he was persistently endeavouring to acquire information which he considered crucial to his enquiry. These efforts to obtain the type of evidence they possessed were perfectly obvious.��
MI5 had told Sampson that the reason it did not hand over the tape to Stalker is that he did not ask them for it. �쏷o defend their decision not to disclose this information on the grounds that he did not ask them directly for it is patently dishonest,�� Sampson wrote. �쏮r Stalker could not possibly have known that they possessed the very evidence he was seeking and to have frustrated his efforts in this way is nothing less than a grave abuse of their unique position.��
MI5 eventually destroyed its copy of Tape 042. Sampson recommended that the junior officer who had carried out the destruction be granted immunity from prosecution in return for giving evidence against the MI5 chief and his deputy, whom he believed should be prosecuted for �쐂oing an act with intent and tending to pervert the course of public justice��.
Handing down his judgment in McCauley�셲 appeal last September, Sir Declan Morgan, the lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, was in agreement with Sampson: �쏷he failure of the security service to disclose the tape to Mr Stalker and to provide it to the prosecution was reprehensible.�� Furthermore, the deputy head of special branch had initially misled the director of public prosecutions by leading him to believe that there was no listening device in the hayshed. �쏷hese matters amounted cumulatively to grave misconduct,�� Morgan said; McCauley�셲 conviction was quashed.
In January, as a consequence of the Criminal Cases Review Commission investigation and the appeal court�셲 judgment, the director of public prosecutions announced that he was requesting an investigation into the concealment and destruction of the tape. In April, it was announced that Police Scotland would be investigating the actions of the former MI5 officers, while the police ombudsman of Northern Ireland would be investigating the actions of the former special branch detectives. It remains to be seen whether anyone will face prosecution.
Stalker, now 76 and living in peaceful retirement in the north-west of England, says he has no wish to talk about the inquiry to which his name will always remain attached. Sampson, 10 years older, is also reluctant to revisit the past.
The hayshed is still standing. I drove down the narrow lane that runs west from Derrymacash, towards the River Bann, and after a mile or so I saw it on the right, behind the redbrick bungalow. Its corrugated roof was in need of repair and the breeze-block wall to the left of the wooden double door was scarred and pockmarked. On either side of the door were grimy windows, which failed to let in more than a glimmer of light. In the window on the left there were two small holes, where the first rounds entered, striking young Michael Tighe in the heart as he sat on a stack of hay bales.
The shed was being used to store lifesize, painted wooden figures of cowboys and Indians, and soldiers from the American civil war. �쏧�셫 looking after them for a touring Wild West show,�� the owner of the property explained. �쏡oesn�셳 Hiawatha look lovely?�� It is tempting to think of the scene inside the hayshed as a bizarre metaphor for the Troubles: the warriors, the roughnecks and the soldiers are stored safely away, their guns holstered and their eyes seeing nothing, while outside, the world moves on.
Two university students have been convicted of wanting to kill on London�셲 streets in the name of Islamic State in what counter-terrorism officials believe was the most significant jihadi plot targeting Britain in a decade.
Police, soldiers and civilians were the intended targets of the conspiracy, with a moped being used to stage drive-by killings after the terrorists had gained a gun, silencer and ammunition from a London-based criminal.
Ringleader Tarik Hassane, 22, pleaded guilty to having directed others in the plot through encrypted social media programs, while he was a medical student.
His friend Suhaib Majeed, 21, a physics student at King�셲 College London and a prize-winning maths student, was convicted of the plot by a jury at the Old Bailey. Both were born and raised in west London and were friends from Westminster City school. They were lured by extremist Islamist online propaganda and personal contacts to throw away glittering futures.
Hassane is suspected of associating with Mohammed Emwazi, who gained worldwide notoriety as Isis�셲 �쏪ihadi John��. They grew up in the same area and went to the same mosque in west London.
There was a five-year age difference between Hassane and Emwazi, and on social media Hassane wrote about the influence of older people he met at the mosque, when he was aged 16. He said he �쐌et some good older practising bros. Started hanging around with them �╈��
The Guardian understands Hassane is also believed by investigators to have visited Isis-controlled territory in Syria and pledged allegiance to the terrorist group in July 2014.
In encrypted messages the group had called itself �쐔he turnup terror squad��, and the plotters were spurred on by a September 2014 fatwa from Isis urging �쐇ts supporters to kill disbelievers in the west��. The effects of that have since been felt in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere.
Investigators believe the plotters led by Hassane were in contact and receiving directions from Isis in Syria in encrypted communications via social media platforms.
Hassane was known as �쐔he surgeon�� and communicated with other plotters via the encrypted messaging services Telegram and Pidgin, using a mixture of Arabic and London street slang.
They also used a suite of encryption tools developed by jihadis known as Asrar al-Mujahideen (Secrets of the Mujahideen), which was developed by al-Qaida.
Majeed was captured by a surveillance officer inRegent�셲 Park. London, while communicating with the Isis contact, who was telling him how to install layers of encryption on a laptop.
Two other men were convicted of firearms offences, for sourcing and supplying the firearm. But Nyall Hamlett, 25, and Nathan Cuffy, 26, were acquitted of involvement in the terror plot or knowing what Majeed or Hassane were really intending.
Cuffy was found with other firearms and both he and Hamlett are facing significant jail terms for the firearms offences.
Commander Dean Haydon, Scotland Yard�셲 head of counter-terrorism, said: �쏷his is an elevation of complexity �� committing a drive-by shooting, acquiring a firearm, silencer and ammunition, in broad daylight targeting police, military and members of the public before making their getaway.��
In early 2014 Hassane�셲 extremism was clear in his writings on a social media platform called AskFM.
He praised Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, said by the US to be one of the most influential jihadi theorists, and there are frequent mentions of the writings and YouTube videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical cleric linked to multiple terrorist plots against Britain and the US, who was killed in a drone strike.
Hassane praised Osama bin Laden as a martyr, writing: �쏦e�셲 a big mujahid. May Allah accept him as a shaheed [martyr] ameen.��
He also wrote: �쏮uslims shouldn�셳 be in the UK in the first place,�� and agreed it was obligatory to go to Syria.
By 2013 Hassane was a medical student in Khartoum, Sudan, at a university targeted by Islamist extremists.
The Islamic Cultural Association there was taken over by a British extremist, Mohammed Fakhri, in 2013 and other students became radicalised. Fakhri joined Isis, and 17 other British medical students also skipped their studies to join the nascent �쐁aliphate��.
The plot to attack London was stopped by a joint operation by Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command and Britain�셲 domestic and foreign intelligence services.
The first arrests came one day after the plotters took possession of the firearm, bullets and silencer in late September 2014. They were also trying to get money to buy a moped, which they would use to ride around west London to attack their targets.
These are believed to have been Shepherd�셲 Bush police station and a Territorial Army barracks in White City, both in west London. They were reconnoitred by Hassane using Google Street View.
After his co-conspirators were arrested, Hassane still came back to London from Sudan, determined to carry out the attack, and was arrested in October 2014.
Isis intended Hassane to lead marauding armed terrorists to attack London weeks before the January 2015 atrocities in Paris. Haydon said: �쏧t does draw parallels with Paris. The attackers were intent on murder, intent on using a firearm, intent on causing fear, distress, disorder in a particular part of west London.��
Inquests are about to resume into the deaths of 30 Britons killed in a mass shooting in a Tunisian holiday resort in the biggest loss of British life to terrorism since the 2005 London bombings.
Families who lost relatives hope the inquiry, resuming on Monday, will uncover whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy on the beach outside the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse on 26 June 2015.
Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing in 30C heat when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 tourists, 30 of whom were British, in arampage that lasted nearly 40 minutes. Rezgui was shot dead by Tunisian authorities as he ran from the hotel.
The attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis. They killed 21 people �� mostly European tourists �� on the spot, and another victim died 10 days later.
Travel company Tui, which owns Thomson holidays, through which all 30 of the Britons booked their trip, is expected to come under significant scrutiny over its handling of travel advice for Tunisia from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Lawyers representing families of 20 of the deceased Britons are to accuse Tui of �쐏ractically hiding and keeping out of the limelight�� FCO warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, according to papers submitted in advance of the resumption of inquests.
The travel firm, which in the year to September made an underlying profit of ��1bn (짙866m), is also said to have sold customers travel insurance that excluded cancellation cover caused by terrorism risks. Before the Sousse attack, Tui is said in submissions by the families to have discouraged cancellation by penalising customers up to the full cost of their booked holidays if they chose to cancel as a result of learning of terrorist activities or risks.
Tui is to argue that the measures it had in place at the time for forwarding travel advice were appropriate but the Sousse attack changed the climate and they responded accordingly.
The coroner, Nicholas Loraine-Smith, is to hear evidence on these issues, as well as details on the events of the day, the security in the hotel and Rezgui�셲 background.
Andrew Ritchie QC, who has been appointed by Irwin Mitchell to represent 20 families at the inquests, said: �쏷hese inquests will seek to answer important questions for the families, in particular: how their loved ones came to be exposed to terrorism at the five-star hotel; whether Tui communicated Foreign and Commonwealth Office terrorism warnings to their customers before or after bookings; the security arrangements �� if any �� in place at the Imperial Hotel; and whether the holiday insurance sold by Tui to customers covered terrorism.
�쏷he families seek the truth and respect the coronial system and the hard work put into the preparation of the evidence by the UK police. They wish to see a better warning system in place to prevent future deaths and so that holidaymakers can make better-informed decisions when purchasing holidays abroad.��
Some evidence may be considered behind closed doors due to its sensitivity in preventing future terrorist attacks, following an application by the FCO.
Rezgui was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student at the University of Kairouan, from Gaafour in north-west Tunisia. It emerged he had received military training in Libya. Some of his associates went on to launch the Bardo Museum attack.
The ringleader behind the Sousse and Bardo attack �� and Rezgui�셲 recruiter �� was identified by a BBC Panorama investigation broadcast on Tuesday as Chamseddine al-Sandi. Panorama said Sandi was believed to be on the run in Libya. The Guardian has not been able to verify his role.
Two weeks after the Sousse attack, the FCO altered its travel advice to advise against all travel to four areas of Tunisia and advise against all but essential travel to the rest of the country. This advice remains in place.
Tourism in Tunisia, which had accounted for 8% in gross domestic product �� a broad measure for the size of a country�셲 economy �� has suffered considerably since the attacks. According to the Tunisian ministry of tourism, tourist receipts plunged 50% year-on-year in 2016, while the number of border arrivals was down 18%.
A Tui spokeswoman said: �쏷ui UK is taking a full and active role in the inquests into the deaths of the 30 British nationals killed during the terrorist attack in Sousse, Tunisia in June 2015.
�쏬ike others, we want to understand the specific circumstances that led to this atrocity. We are cooperating with the coroner and will continue to do so, in order to help ensure that the tragic deaths of those killed can be thoroughly investigated, the relevant facts determined and any lessons learned. With the inquests about to be heard, we consider that it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.��
On July 22, 1968, three armed Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Israeli passenger airliner flying from Rome to Tel Aviv. The terrorists belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), one of the groups that made up the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The hijacking marked the advent, according to the director of the Rand Corporation's terrorism research unit in Washington, DC, of the modern era of international terrorism.
Although this was not the first hijacking of a plane - many had been temporarily diverted from their intended destinations in order to get the hijackers somewhere else, generally Cuba - it was the first one designed to terrorise a nation into changing its policy and to force world attention on a cause. The hijacking was the first in a series of dramatic and well-coordinated attacks planned and approved at the highest levels of the PLO. The purpose of these hijackings was subsequently acknowledged, indeed proclaimed, by the PLO's chief observer to the UN: to bring public attention to the Palestinian cause as an initial step in a multifaceted programme of terror, the goal of which was the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Success begets repetition. By the early 70s, the pattern was becoming quite discernible. Terrorists who hijacked, blew up or otherwise attacked commercial airliners would, if captured, quickly be released by most countries. Only Israel would keep captured terrorists in prison for substantial terms. The message was clear. Terrorist attacks committed outside Israel would go unpunished and would generally achieve the desired result.
It was against this background that Palestinian terrorist organisations planned the most dramatic act of international terrorism up until that time: the 1972 attack on the Israeli Olympic team in Munich. Based on the reaction to international terrorism over the previous four years, the terrorists planning the Munich operation could expect to succeed in attracting the world's attention and be relatively certain that if any of the terrorists were captured they would not be held for long. They could expect to be treated as heroes by supporters of their cause, and as "official state guests" by the European governments that held them for a brief period before sending them home.
But international reaction went beyond merely "taking note" of the Palestinian cause. Even decent people cannot ignore indecent events. It is only natural to talk about evil. What many in the international community did was to ascribe a positive moral content to the evils of Palestinian terrorism. The assumption seemed to be that any group of people willing to resort to such extreme measures must have a just and compelling cause.
Soon afterwards, the UN granted observer status to the PLO - the first terrorist organisation to be so honoured. Recall that all this was taking place while the PLO was still boasting of its reliance on terrorism as its primary mechanism of "diplomacy". Bruce Hoffman, the Rand Corporation's director of terrorism research, saw a likely causal relation between the willingness of the Palestinians to resort to terrorism and their acceptance by the UN: "It is perhaps not entirely coincidental, then, that 18 months after Munich the PLO's leader, Yasser Arafat, was invited to address the UN general assembly and shortly afterwards the PLO was granted special observer status in that international body. Indeed, by the end of the 70s the PLO, a non-state actor, had formal diplomatic relations with more countries (86) than Israel (72). It is doubtful whether the PLO could have achieved this success had it not resorted to international terrorism."
If anyone actually believed that honouring Arafat and legitimising his terrorist organisation would persuade them - or anyone else - to abandon terror, they were quickly proved wrong. Within 10 days of Arafat's speeches Palestinian terrorists hijacked a British airliner in Dubai. The plane was eventually flown to Tunisia, where a passenger was killed. Over the half decade following the legitimisation of Arafat and his cause, Palestinian terrorists attacked Orly airport, hijacked a plane to Entebbe, Uganda (where Israeli commandos rescued all but three passengers), attacked a passenger terminal at Istanbul, hijacked a Lufthansa plane, hijacked an Israeli bus, killing 26 civilians, attacked an El Al plane in Paris, and shot passengers in Brussels. During this same half decade, the UN declared its first international day of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Palestinian terrorism was working.
The European policy of appeasing terrorists and encouraging their acts continued unabated through the 80s, as did Palestinian terrorism. Perhaps the most publicised instance of this European "policy" of appeasing terrorists came on the heels of the hijacking of an Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro. In October 1985, armed PFLP terrorists boarded the ship as it left Alexandria, Egypt. In one of the most cowardly acts in the history of terrorism, they murdered a Jewish-American man in a wheelchair. Once again American plans for a rescue were thwarted by the Italian government, whose "foreign policy required it to maintain very close relations with the Arab states and the PLO", according to Philip Heymann, the former US deputy attorney-general under President Clinton and author of Terrorism and America.
The terrorists were freed, with the approval of the Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi, who "later said somewhat implausibly [that he did not know] that they had murdered a wheelchair-bound American, Leon Klinghoffer," Heymann wrote. But even that absurd excuse was not available to Craxi when he once again frustrated efforts by the US to bring the terrorists to justice. After the hijackers were freed in Egypt, a small Egyptian plane was flying them to a hero's welcome in another friendly Arab country. The US military intercepted the plane in midair and forced it to land at a Nato base in Italy, where American C-141 troop transporters were waiting to fly the terrorists to the US to stand trial for the hijacking of the ship and the murder of Klinghoffer. But Italian soldiers blocked the Americans from approaching the Egyptian plane. Finally, after the Italians promised to bring the hijackers to justice, the US backed down and the four hijackers were taken into Italian custody. Among them were two important terrorist leaders with rivers of blood on their hands. The Italians released them immediately. The others were tried, convicted and allowed to " 'escape' while on leave from Italian prisons", in Heymann's words. As the Palestinian reliance on terrorism increased, most of the international community became more - not less - supportive of the Palestinian cause.
The message being sent by the international community was unmistakable: we will not punish you or your cause for your use of terrorism; to the contrary, we will reward you, honour your leaders and further your cause. If this was the message - and how can any reasonable observer deny that it was? - then what did the international community expect the terrorists to do? If a tactic is working, why change it, especially if the international community seems to approve of it?
The international community responded to terrorism between 1968 and 2001 by rewarding and legitimising it, rather than punishing and condemning it. Seen in this light, it is no wonder we had to suffer the horrors of September 11, 2001. Those who bestowed these benefits on the Palestinians following their terrorism, especially our European allies and the UN, made September 11 unavoidable. By continuing to reward Palestinian terrorism even after September 11, they have continued to make future terrorist attacks more likely.
One explanation, though certainly not a justification, for why some nations deal with terrorism by capitulating, involves a variation on the prisoner's dilemma. This heuristic model involves two hypothetical prisoners who are confined in separate cells awaiting trial. If neither prisoner cooperates with the police, they would both be better off, since there would be no direct evidence to convict them. But if either cooperates, then the cooperator would be better off, because he would get a deal, while the non-cooperator would be convicted and get a harsh sentence. Since neither knows whether the other will cooperate, each must make a decision based on speculation as to what the other will do.
I have had considerable experience with real prisoners' dilemmas, especially in white-collar conspiracy cases involving several suspects. Although each alleged conspirator knows that without the cooperation of one there will be no case, none of them trust the others to stand tall against the authorities who are offering a deal to the first cooperator. Generally, one of them breaks down and the prosecutor gets to make his case against the others. The reason one of them breaks down is that his lawyer tells him that experience shows that at least one will eventually cooperate and that he is better off "winning the race to the prosecutor's door," since the first cooperator gets the best deal and later cooperators may get no deal at all.
How does this prisoner's dilemma relate to terrorism? Every rational nation knows that the international community would be better off as a whole if no nation were ever to give in to terrorists. But every nation also knows that some nations, seeking short-term advantage, will give in. The nations that do give in may be able to strike a deal with at least some terrorist organisations, sparing their citizens from being targeted. In the case of Germany, the Brandt government was even willing to participate in a staged hijacking, in which it knew no one would be hurt, rather than risk a real hijacking that would place its citizens at risk. Other nations have freed imprisoned terrorists, paid cash bounties, or otherwise helped the cause of terrorists. Some have generally refused to submit to terrorists' demands. The reality is that terrorists can count on some countries being more willing to capitulate than others.
These capitulating countries - such as France, Germany and Italy - may in fact be subject to more instances of conditional terrorism, such as hijackings during which no one is hurt, if the government submits to the terrorists' demand to release prisoners. Everyone knows that these capitulating countries will quickly give in to the demands of the terrorists so that it is not to the terrorists' advantage to hurt their citizens. Other countries, which have reputations as non-capitulators, will be subject to fewer instances of pure conditional terrorism but more instances of nonconditional violent terrorist acts, such as blowing up airplanes, shooting passengers and destroying buildings.
Some of these violent acts will be directed against the targets of non-capitulators that are located within the jurisdiction of the capitulators. Examples of this are quite common and include the hijacking of the Achille Lauro containing Americans and Jews, the blowing up of Americans in Germany, and the hijacking of American and Israeli planes from French, Italian or Greek airports. The terrorists know that if they are caught in a country that capitulates, they will be quickly released, even if a noncapitulating country is seeking their extradition. This cynical phenomenon, widely known both to terrorists and to the countries involved, determines - at least in part - the rules of the terrorist game.
Throughout its long history, terrorism has had a checkered record of stunning successes and dismal failures - at least as judged by the achievements of the goals proclaimed by its practitioners. Recently, terrorism's successes have been more visible than its failures, and the international community - diplomatic, religious, academic - has been selective in its condemnation of terrorists. For these reasons, aggrieved groups and individuals have increasingly found terrorism an acceptable, and even attractive, option. Nearly every nation has made some use of terrorism. Nearly every cause has supported or benefited from some form of terrorism. Many individuals have terrorist groups they "approve of" "refuse to condemn" "understand" or apply a more permissive standard to than the one they use for other terrorist groups.
The US has supported, financed and trained groups that are widely regarded as terrorist, such as the Contras in Nicaragua, the mojahedin in Afghanistan, Unita in Angola and Samuel K Doe in Liberia/Sierra Leone. Many Jews supported the Irgun and the Stern Gang during Israel's struggle for independence. The anti-apartheid movement in South Africa employed terrorism, with widespread support from many African-Americans (and others as well). To a far lesser extent, small numbers of blacks supported, or at least refused to condemn, such American terrorist groups as the Black Panthers, the Revolutionary Action Movement and the Black Liberation Army. Some Irish-Americans have assisted Catholic terrorists in Northern Ireland, while some have quietly admired their actions. A small number of Jews supported the Jewish Defence League during the late 60s and early 70s. A substantial number of American Muslims have contributed money to Islamist terrorist groups.
The important point is that terrorism, as a mechanism of change, has never been universally condemned - at least before September 11. Our past policies - which have rewarded the causes of terrorists, honoured their leaders, freed the actual terrorists, neglected on-the-ground intelligence, failed to secure our airports and borders, allowed terrorist groups and states that support them to obtain weapons of mass destruction and refused to hold states that sponsor terrorism accountable for the actions of their surrogates - were prescriptions for creating more and worse terrorism.
No one who observed how the world responded to the globalisation of terrorism between 1968 and 2001 should have been surprised by September 11. The only surprise, and one I suspect the terrorists did not anticipate in light of the world's previous reactions, was the swiftness and massiveness of the military response. We are now, finally, engaged in an effort to send a message to terrorists - at least terrorists who target Americans - that they will pay a heavy price for their terrorism, that terrorism will only hurt their cause.

The Republican candidate혻for the presidency, Donald Trump, now reacts to any혻terrorist incident with crude cynicism. While the incessant killings of Americans by Americans prove only that America needs more guns, a failed killing by an혻American Muslim is �쏿 terrible thing혻that is going on in our country �� an attack on America��.
The hamfisted New York bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was혻to Trump not just guilty before trial혻but a �쐄oreign enemy combatant��, to be detained indefinitely until the end혻of hostilities. America should �쐊nock the hell�� out of such �쏧slamics�� and stop being �쐅entle��.
Trump complained that the United States �쐗ill now give [Rahami] amazing hospitalisation, the best doctors in the world, and probably room service��. Worst of all his �쐏unishment will not be혻what it once would have been��. As for혻Trump�셲 opponent, Hillary Clinton, he accused her immigration policy of being directly responsible. He said: �쏻e혻now know why terrorists want her so badly to be president.��
In the potential leader of a great democracy, this is alarmist drivel. We혻should also be careful, since the혻exploitation of existential fear has long been a feature of America�셲 isolated혻political culture. In 1950, a little-known American senator, Estes Kefauver, achieved national fame by holding televised hearings into America�셲 �쐎rganised crime��, drawing on blood-curdling fantasies of a Sicilian-American �쐌afia��. This mafia was, Kefauver claimed, holding American cities to ransom. Communities lived in혻fear of it. The national economy was혻menaced by it.
The televised hearings were at times ludicrous. One hoodlum after another was dragged to Washington to protest that all he was running was a few protection rackets on the Lower East Side. Try as Kefauver might to find a Mr혻Big to justify his extravagant hearings, he found only a disorganised trail of small-time hoods. He still demanded a혻new Washington bureaucracy to �쐁rack혻down on organised crime�� �� and혻ran unsuccessfully for president. The search for �쏿 mafia�� was subcontracted to Hollywood.
Two years later another senator, Joe혻McCarthy, decided to exploit a different �쐃xistential�� scare. His committee investigated what he claimed혻was the �쐌assive�� penetration of the government and military by communists and homosexuals. Fear of a spurious threat to the state was turned into a witch-hunt by McCarthy and his aide, a certain Richard Nixon. There was a red under every bed �� and혻a혻blackmailer in it. McCarthy, until his mental collapse, became a national celebrity. Americans have seemed to get a frisson from being told they are threatened, perhaps because they never혻have been.
Likewise with Trump. The New York bomber was no more attacking America than, in Britain, Lee Rigby�셲 killers were �쏿ttacking Britain��. Why lend them such glory? These are pathetic groups, sometimes just individuals, committing nasty crimes. For better or worse, it happens every day. That the criminals occasionally yell, �쏛llahu Akbar�� should be neither here nor there. That they may have travelled to the Middle East or혻downloaded jihadi tracts is a legitimate concern to the police. It is not a threat to the stability, let alone the existence, of the state. Yet such is the current hysteria that he is to be prosecuted for having a �쐗eapon of mass destruction��, namely a pressure cooker.
How often need we state that such exaggeration is precisely what the terrorist wants? It turns the impossible into the rhetorically plausible. Trump last week dusted a backstreet bomb-maker with the glory of war. He afforded him the gigantic kudos of political status.
The west�셲 response to jihadi terrorism since 9/11 has been wholly counter-productive. Under the pretext of �쐏ublic reassurance��, it has sown the seeds of fear in the hope of harvesting votes of gratitude. Just as there was once a mafia round every corner and a red in every bed, so now Joseph Conrad�셲 terrorists lurk �쐋ike pests in every street of men��. If one harvest has come in votes �� George Bush and Tony Blair did혻very well from 9/11 �� the gourmand at the feast has been terrorism itself. Osama bin Laden�셲 tiny cabal has been turned into a global movement, drenched in blood, retribution and violent glamour.
Clinton�셲 reaction to the New York explosions may have seemed pedestrian, but it was correct. It was to counsel responsibility, �쐓mart law-enforcement and good intelligence in concert with our values��. It reminded us of the response of mayor Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, when he told New Yorkers not to panic but to go to the park, see a show, buy a pizza and �쐁ontinue with your normal lives��. This was the opposite of Blair�셲 response, which was to declare that 9/11 �쐁hanged the world�� and �쐒ewrote the rules of the game��. I could hear Bin Laden cheering.
As Richard English shows in his new study, Does Terrorism Work?, we need to remind ourselves what this -ism sets out to do. Its rational ambition is to change the world around it. Nor does it always fail, as some might argue in the case of the IRA. Violence in a political cause is as old as history. Civil terror is a classic tool of the weak against the strong.
In the case of modern jihadism, brutal mayhem has yet to deliver it a stable caliphate. But it has laid its groundwork in ethnic and religious polarisation between Muslim and non-Muslim. It has undermined the tolerance of western democracies. From America�셲 detention without trial to Theresa May�셲 snooper�셲 charter, it has slit open the soft underbelly of liberalism.
Such a gain for terrorism is the result혻of foolish politicians looking for cheap votes �� and the media looking for cheap headlines. Scaremongering, the search for a foe against whom to pretend혻to defend the state, may be as old as terror itself. But given the absolute security of modern America and Britain, it is a dangerous self-indulgence. It should be excoriated.
It is not the bomb that is the terrorist�셲 accomplice but the response혻to the bomb. It is not Rahami but Trump�셲 response to Rahami that we혻should fear.
A Ramadan TV ad by a Middle Eastern telecommunications company in which victims of terrorism confront a suicide bomber and urge society to �쐀omb violence with mercy�� has provoked a heated debate in the region, with some praising its attempt to tackle extremism and others criticising it for using victims of bombings and a simplistic portrayal of terrorists.
The three-minute video by Zain, a commercial mobile operator based in Kuwait, went viral over the weekend with some calling for it to be withdrawn, while others praised its tagline of �쐗e will counter their attacks of hatred with songs of love, from now until happiness��.
The video begins with images of a militant preparing a suicide vest interspersed with shots of a man and woman preparing for their wedding, a grandfather playing with a child, and children in a classroom. It opens with a voiceover by a child, saying: �쏧 will tell God everything, that you�셶e filled the cemeteries with our children and emptied our school desks.��
As the suicide bomber travels to his destination, he is confronted by victims of terrorism, covered in blood and dirt, including a child actor playing the role of Omran Daqneesh, the child from Aleppo whose bloodied image after he survived an airstrike by the Syrian government was seen around the world.
It also features a bride who survived the bombing of a wedding hall in Amman in Jordan, a man who lost his son in a massive car bombing in Baghdad, Iraq, and another who survived a suicide attack on a Shia mosque in Kuwait.
At various points in the video, victims of terror attempt to reclaim the bomber�셲 religious invocations �� when he declares �쐔here is no god but Allah��, a man carrying a child on a bus retorts: �쏽ou who comes in the name of death, he is the creator of life.�� When the bomber says �쏥od is greater��, a schoolteacher responds: �쏷han those who obey without contemplation.��
As the bomber flees, the victims are joined by Hussein al-Jasmi, an Emirati pop star, in a chorus urging people to respond to anger with kindness, and violence with mercy.
TV viewing in the Arab world usually skyrockets during Ramadan, when Muslims are expected to fast from dawn until sunset. Countless new soap operas are aired during the day and through the breakfast meal and well into the night, along with new advertisements and TV shows starring the region�셲 top actors.
But few ads addressing the issue of extremism have stirred as much debate as the Zain video. Anti-extremism campaigns have in the past focused on Iraq in particular, and were often shorter videos with a grimmer approach, little musicality and tag lines such as �쐔errorism has no religion��.
The Zain spot faced criticism from social media users even as some praised its tackling of a sensitive topic, with many Syrians condemning its use of an actor to play Omran, pointing out that the boy was wounded in an airstrike by the regime of Bashar al-Assad rather than in an attack by Muslim extremists. They argued that the majority of victims of violence in Syria had suffered at the hands of the regime, rather than jihadis.
�쏷he child Omran is a victim of Assad�셲 barrel bombs and not the terrorism of Daesh,�� wrote Kutaiba Yassin, a Syrian writer, using a synonym for Islamic State. �쏱art of justice for any victim is to expose his killer. Zain�셲 ad distorts the truth.��
Some also felt it was inappropriate for a corporation to use the images of victims of terrorism in a commercial spot, arguing it was exploitative.
But one Facebook comment said: �쏧t�셲 wonderful. We need these beautiful words these days. I wish those words are applied through actions in the Muslim world.��
One of the common critiques of the ad, however, was that extremism is a more complex phenomenon that requires a broader effort by society at large.
�쏣veryone loves to cry �쁢xtremism�� and �쁈sis�� and nobody wants to really address the political reasons behind their strength,�� said Tamara al-Rifai, a Syrian communications expert. �쏻hat�셲 the ad saying? We are trying to criminalise these acts of violence as a society, correct? Who are we talking to? The criminals? They will laugh at us.
�쏷hen we are talking to each other, the ones who blame some hazy dark forces for everything without really going to the crux of why they exist to start with,�� she added.
The Met police commissioner has urged Londoners to remain vigilant a week after the terror attack that left eight people dead and dozens injured.
Cressida Dick�셲 call came as police lifted the remaining cordon in Borough that had been in place since last Saturday night.
She told residents and visitors that London remained one of the world�셲 safest cities.
�쏽ou will be seeing police, armed and unarmed, in areas where there are crowds and around the streets of London, possibly at a higher level than you have done before,�� Dick said. �쏽ou should feel reassured by that, but please don�셳 give in to terrorists and let�셲 go about our daily business.��
The Met chief added: �쏻e, in this city, have experienced terrorism for as long as I�셶e been alive and we have always been able to step up and deal with a new threat and that�셲 what we�셱e going to do here.��
Dick urged people to alert police if they saw something suspicious, if someone they knew started to �쐀ehave strangely��, or if they had concerns about someone hiring a vehicle.
Borough Market is expected to reopen next week, she added. �쏷he rest of us Londoners want to support those people who have been affected, including those who run the market.��
The market said it had been flooded with messages of support and has posted a list of ways that people can support its traders.
They include donating to the trader support fund, visiting other markets across the capital where some traders also have stalls, buying goods from their websites and supporting the Red Cross Saturday Night for London campaign.
Participating restaurants will be donating money from a chosen dish, hundreds of cafes, bars and pubs will be holding collections and Uber will donate 짙1 for every trip taken in London between 8pm and midnight on Saturday.
Funds will go to the charity�셲 UK Solidarity Fund, which was launched in response to the Manchester Arena and London Bridge attacks.
Southwark council said on Saturday that all residents would now be able to return to their homes after police left the crime scene.
Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of the council, said: �쏻e understand that the cordons have had a massive impact on local residents and businesses and would like to thank those individuals for their patience, goodwill and hospitality.��
Security staff from the market will help residents access the closed areas, which can be entered via the Stoney Street junction with Borough High Street.
Southwark cathedral will reopen on Sunday and a book of condolence will be available to sign.
A community assistance centre has also been set up at the cathedral.
Malaysia�셲 police chief said Monday that 17 suspected militants have been detained for allegedly plotting to carry out terrorist acts in the country�셲 largest city, Kuala Lumpur.
Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said the 17 were detained Sunday. Khalid tweeted that two of them had just returned from Syria. He didn�셳 give details, and a police official said a statement will be issued later.
Since last year, the government has detained scores of Malaysians believed to be supporters of the Islamic State militant group.
The latest detentions came just days after the Home Ministry proposed two new anti-terror laws that will reintroduce indefinite detention without trial and allow the seizure of passports of anyone suspected of supporting terror acts in a bid to curb suspected militant activities in the country.
Critics criticised the move as a revival of a controversial security law that was repealed in 2012 and warned the proposed laws could severely curtail civil liberties.
Opposition lawmaker Nurul Izzah Anwar said in a statement that the new laws could be misused against political opponents.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act bill will allow authorities to detain suspects indefinitely without trial and the decision cannot be challenged in court.
The Special Measures Against Terrorism in Foreign Countries bill empowers authorities to suspend or revoke the travel documents or any citizens or foreigners believed to be engaging in or supporting terrorist acts.
�쏷he draft counter-terrorism law is like a legal zombie returned from the grave of the discredited and abusive Internal Security Act,�� said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
Other proposals will increase penalties for terror-related acts, including up to 30 years in prison for those found receiving terrorism training or instruction.
The proposed bills will be debated in parliament this week.
In the last three months, the UK has suffered the most intense surge of terrorist activity for more than a decade. But who has attacked us?
The obvious answer is the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis). The group has launched a global offensive during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. As a consequence, there has has been a surge of violence from Nigeria to the Philippines.
In recent weeks, there have also been other attacks elsewhere in the west, though thankfully without the same degree of harm. In Paris, a policeman was bludgeoned with a hammer, and in Melbourne, Australia, a woman was held hostage and a man killed.
We do not know yet how closely the seven men responsible for these acts of violence were connected to Isis �� even though the group has claimed responsibility for all of them.
Salman Abedi, the 23-year-old student who attacked in Manchester, might have been in touch with Isis when in Libya only 10 days before striking. Khaled Massood, who drove a vehicle into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament, appears to have been only inspired by the group. The shooting in Melbourne may not have been terrorism at all.
The attacks in the UK involved only five men, as far as we know. With those in Paris and Melbourne, that makes seven. Do they share any characteristics that might help our security services to identify future attackers and avert future tragedy?
At first glance, the answer seems to be yes. All are male, young, immigrants or born of immigrant parents and identify �� at least when they commit their attacks �� as Muslims. On close examination, however, the picture becomes more complex.
Take the age of the attackers. The youngest was 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba, one of the three men who drove a van into crowds on London Bridge and then stabbed people in bars and restuarants. The oldest was Massood, the Westminster attacker, who was 52. The others were between 23 and 40.
Education? Some of the seven have few or no real qualifications. But Farid Ikken, the man who attacked a policeman at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, had a masters degree and was studying for a PhD in media at a French university. None were wealthy, but that�셲 hardly evidence of a link between poverty and extremist violence.
Faith? Ikken, who had lived for a long time in Sweden with a Swedish woman, was described by friends as �쐓oft, secular��. All seven appear to have become attracted to jihadism without first becoming devout Muslims. Moderate faith did not pave the way to a more extremist variety. One �� Massood �� was a convert. Hunting for devout Muslims will not help us.
How about background? Most had unstable homes, often with absent fathers. Several had criminal records, mainly for acts of violence. One was a meth addict who had spent much of his adult life behind bars. Some were married. At least two had children. At least three had a history of controlling behaviour and violence towards women. It is unclear if any suffered mental illness.
Yacquub Kharye, the Melbourne attacker, had travelled to Somalia to join an al-Qaida linked group. Khuram Bhutt had been involved with an extremist organisation for years. Others had no such connections.
Other than Massood, all were immigrants or born of immigrant parents. But this bald statement hides vast differences between, for example, Abedi, who was born in the UK and grew up in Manchester, and Zaghba, a recent arrival from Italy.
The conclusion is that any single �쐏rofile�� which would cover all these variations would be so broad as to be useless. Repeated attempts to find �쐔errorist characteristics�� by researchers have failed. Nor is evidence of radical views enough to spot a threat. Only a tiny minority of such people go on to commit violence.
So how can we detect those who are a threat and stop atrocities? A breakdown in communication between Italian and British secret services led to Zaghba, a self-declared �쐔errorist��, slipping out of sight on arrival in the UK. So better coordination is essential. Others �� such as Bhutt and Kharye �� were clearly involved in extremist circles or even violent extremism and merited closer attention.
But surveillance of large numbers of suspects is not practical without a vast expansion of our security services.
The only way potential attackers will be identified before they kill and maim is through the most old-fashioned means one can imagine: someone warning authorities about what they plan to do. This can be people in the workplace, the mosque, or at school. Research tells us that more than 70% of Islamic militants who operate alone tell someone of their plans. The first line of defence against Islamic militancy is not our crash barriers or covert operations, nor armed cops or MI5, it is a potential terrorist�셲 brother, mother, partner or friend.
The conviction of Anjem Choudary marks a significant moment in the history of British jihadism, but it is unclear what kind of an impact it will have. Terrorist groups and networks do suffer when they lose charismatic leaders. Their removal is unlikely to completely destroy a group, but it does change the dynamic.
Terrorist networks are, at their core, groups of people gathering around an ideology. Individuals are drawn in for various (often deeply personal) reasons, but to function as an effective unit that works to advance an ideology requires organisation and leadership. Otherwise, it is just a cluster of angry people with no particular direction.
It is here that leadership figures are key. They provide direction and can help motivate others, as well as offering some practical experience and, crucially, contacts. An individual who has risen to the top of a terrorist network after a long period of time will develop an understanding of what works. The relationships they will have developed over time are hard to replicate.
Choudary is a prime example. Involved in the formation of the UK-based jihadist group al-Muhajiroun in the mid-1990s, Choudary had pedigree and trust among the community of individuals drawn to the group as well as the wider extremist community. This included those who joined the group pre- and post-9/11. He understood the mechanics of how to organise protests and attract media attention, providing the kinds of soundbites news organisations wanted to use. And he was a charming and charismatic fellow who would make people laugh while he told them about the brutal punishments that would be meted out in the perfect Islamic state he was seeking to achieve. All of this made him a very persuasive figure to the lost or curious young men and women who were drawn to him after seeing or hearing him in the press. In his absence there is no doubt that the network will suffer to some degree, even if Choudary�셲 own reputation is enhanced to some degree by the perception that he is martyr to the cause, possibly adding to his street cred among followers when he is released.
Other terrorist groups and networks have suffered as a result of the loss of such figures. The Shining Path in Peru largely shrank back into drug smuggling networks after its leader Abimael Guzman was arrested in 1992. Al-Qaida has never quite been the same since Osama bin Laden was killed and the less charismatic Ayman al-Zawahiri took over. After Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed, al-Qaida in Iraq faced a period of decline. In all of these cases, the groups did find ways of picking up or evolving subsequently, but the removal of leadership figures had a noticeable impact.
The importance of these charismatic leaders is both inspirational and practical. Choudary was famous for being the face of al-Muhajiroun and knew the lines. But he was also an organiser �� which is important in ideological networks that aim to get people excited about ideas. They need not only to deliver the ideology persuasively, but also to help others organise themselves to hold protests, send out messages and establish websites. Choudary was very aware of this role and used the ease of contact and travel around Europe as a way of further internationalising his cause. Describing his relationship with a pair of radicals in Norway who helped establish the local equivalent of al Muhajiroun, Profetens Ummah, Choudary said: �쏷here are no administrative links between us, but I am a mentor and adviser for them.��
The jailing of Choudary for a few years will not end the story of British jihadism. Partially because there are others like him, but also because the narrative he was espousing has entered the mainstream to the extent that his role as a megaphone for radicalisation is less important. But his imprisonment will have an impact on his immediate group and some of the contacts he had developed over time. For some time at least, he will be silenced and unable to spread his hateful ideology so publicly. Unless he is managed carefully, it is possible he might end up causing some damage in prison by radicalising fellow inmates, but the mere fact of his removal from the public conversation for an extended period will certainly do no damage to the cause of countering terrorism in the UK. Meanwhile, some of the people who were drawn into Choudary�셲 orbit and subsequently groomed or recruited by jihadist networks will, thanks to his absence, have a new hurdle to cross.
The fastest growing economy in the world is the new economy of terror, a sophisticated international economic system sustained by terror groups, their sponsors, terror states and various affiliates.
Over the last decade the new economy of terror has merged with the international illegal and criminal economy and together they generate a yearly turnover of $1.5 trillion (짙0.89 trillion) equivalent to 5% of world GDP. This elusive economic system is the structure that supports and nurtures global terror.
How did such an economic giant take shape undetected? The answer lies in the economic role of armed organisations since the end of the second world war. There have been three major evolutionary transitions: state sponsorship, privatisation and globalisation.
State sponsorship was a familiar feature of the cold war, when the two superpowers fought wars by proxy along the periphery of their spheres of influence, using armed groups fully funded by each of them.
The next stage, the privatisation of terrorism, took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when terrorist organisations such as the PLO and the IRA succeeded in financing themselves.
Motivated by the desire for independence from their sponsors and by the rising costs of running armed organisations, terror groups widened their economic horizon. So in the 1990s, when the deregulation of international markets knocked down financial and economic barriers, they were ripe for the last transition: the globalisation of terrorism. Taking advantages of economic liberalisation, terror groups became transnational entities, raising money and carrying out violent cross-border attacks.
The irony is that the new economy of terror is a product of globalisation, particularly of the globalisation that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Globalisation allowed non-state entities to promote a variety of liberal causes, social changes and economic advancement but has also facilitated the networking of terrorist movements such as al-Qaida and the growing sophistication of the "terror economy".
Privatisation, deregulation, openness, the free movement of labour and capital, technological advances - all hailed as key ingredients of economic success in the last 20 years - have been exploited by and adapted into the terror economy in a macabre form of geo-political ju-jitsu: the very strengths of legitimate economies have been turned into double-edged swords.
A further irony is that many of the states the terror economy seeks to displace are themselves the source, directly or indirectly, of arms, logistics, refuge and finance for terror groups. The US dollar, the world's reserve currency, is the new economy of terror's main currency. Western and, more recently, Islamic banks are the vehicles through which this currency is transacted. Small, informal, legitimate businesses are often the agents.
One-third of the $500bn generated every year by the new economy of terror is the product of legitimate businesses, some of which are conducted in the west. These are revenues produced primarily by Islamic bankers, traders, merchants - members of the emerging Muslim middle class. They, and not the radical clerics, are the real economic forces behind Islamist terror, and they fuel the Islamist insurgency across the Muslim world.
Economic analysis of the interdependence of east and west unveils another fascinating scenario, reminiscent of the socio-economic landscape of the Christian Crusades. A structural trade imbalance cripples the east: oil, gas and a few other natural resources are the sole export items that flow to the west.
A similar chronic imbalance hindered western Europe for several centuries after the fall of the Roman empire; at that time. exports to the east were limited to swords and Slavonic slaves. Western Europe was, therefore, forced to import gold to cover its trade deficit, a measure which further weakened its economy and contributed to its continued dependence on the Muslim world.
A millennium ago a new class of European bankers, traders and merchants forged a strategic alliance with the church to break the economic hegemony of Islam. Religion was the ideological umbrella under which the third party - the hungry masses of western Europe - was brought into the alliance. Now, in a sort of reversal of the Crusades, the embryo of the Islamic bourgeoisie has teamed up with the radical clerics. Under the umbrella of Wahhabism - an extreme, seventh century interpretation of Islam - the oppressed Muslim masses are encouraged to take up arms against the corrupted, Muslim, oligarchic rulers and their backers, the west. Religion once again is the ideological blanket under which different social groups are able to gather together.
The economic analysis of modern terrorism relegates religion to a mere recruiting instrument while focusing on the growing tension between a dominant western capitalist system and a populous Muslim nation, economically crippled by corruption and deceit. What we are witnessing today, therefore, goes well beyond the motivations of single Islamist armed groups: it is a clash between two economic systems - one dominant, the west, and the other insurgent, Islam.

Turkey�셲 strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an, rarely goes on the defensive. Yet in his first public appearance since the New Year�셲 Eve massacre in an Istanbul nightclub, he felt obliged to publicly reject the notion that his government�셲 intolerant approach to civil society could possibly have encouraged the attack claimed by Islamic State that left 39 people dead.
Erdo휓an was speaking before a regular gathering of elected community leaders, an opportunity he usually uses to glad-hand political support.
However, the shock of the attack has further rent an already divided country. While no one believes that the government is directly responsible, it is accused of creating an atmosphere in which a religious fanatic could get away with murder.
�쏯obody should be forced to share the same kind of lifestyle,�� said Erdo휓an, adding that if anyone had come under pressure to conform to an alien way of life it had been �쐔his brother�� �� meaning himself.
Erdo휓an�셲 rise from street urchin to inhabiting a palace that architects estimate to have cost more than 짙1bn has indeed been hardscrabble. In 1998 he was removed from office as mayor of Istanbul and briefly imprisoned for reciting a well-known nationalist poem which the prosecutor deemed �쏿n incitement to violence and religious hatred��.
However, greater obstacles might lie ahead. The difficulties that are already facing Erdo휓an�셲 Turkey hardly need rehearsing. A civil war across the Syrian border has led to an influx of what may be as many as three million refugees. A once booming economy is now ailing. In 2015 �� in order to woo the nationalist vote �� the government shredded its attempt to secure an agreement with dissident Kurds. On top of this, there is the debilitating drip, drip of terrorist incidents.
On Thursday, a courthouse in the Aegean city of Izmir came under attack, leaving two people dead along with two assailants who were believed to be Kurdish militants. A rocket assault on a police station in the Kurdish south-east of the country, also on New Year�셲 Eve, was sufficiently commonplace to go unreported.
The killing spree in the Reina nightclub, by contrast, is not something that Turkish society is likely to forget. Whether by chance or by design, the gunman, who is still at large, managed to aggravate the �쐕s and them�� faultline in Turkish society. Despite the president�셲 assurances, many Turks feel that their lifestyle is under siege.
�쏛re they going to carry on until we are all in little pieces?�� asked the owner of one fashionable restaurant who, like many people in the public eye, now prefers to remain anonymous.
Reina is located in the shadow of the first Bosphorus bridge, the pinch point of last July�셲 failed military coup. Since then, Turkey has been under emergency rule in an attempt to root out what politicians describe as terrorist infiltration into the state. The government blames the followers of Fethullah G체len, an Islamic preacher living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.
While exact figures are hard to come by, there have been at least 120,000 dismissals of civil servants, and a third of these may now be under some form of detention �� including two constitutional court judges.
After the Reina shootings, many are beginning to suspect that the government has been chasing the wrong enemy, or at least wonder whether those in charge of the purges are themselves to be trusted. The point was driven home in December when an off-duty policeman working as a presidential guard shot dead the Russian ambassador to Turkey in what he said was revenge for the brutal reconquest of Aleppo.
Ordinary people, including many government supporters, took to the streets last summer to persuade those behind the coup to step down. Even government opponents were outraged that some still believed you could take control of a G20 nation and Nato member by occupying a radio station. Within hours of the putsch, Istanbul�셲 Atat체rk airport was open for commercial flights.
But if the country quickly returned to normal, it has been a new normal in which the president is much stronger but the country over which he rules has been weakened in ways that are still being played out. One consequence feared by many is that Erdo휓an now relies entirely on his core supporters and has given up all pretence of being a �쐎ne nation�� leader.
�쏷urkey no longer thinks in terms of left and right but secularist and Islamicist,�� says Ay힊e 횜nc체, professor emeritus of sociology at Istanbul�셲 Sabanci University.
The head of Turkey�셲 state-funded Presidency of Religious Affairs took the lead from the pulpit in demonising the celebration of new year and social media buzzed with staged lynchings of Father New Year �� the Turkish equivalent of Santa Claus. When one German language school in Istanbul was forced to cancel its festivities, the daily Die Welt responded with a caricature of Erdo휓an on its front page as the Grinch who stole Christmas.
For a Turkish newspaper to do the same would have been a reckless act of bravery. Underlying secularists�� concerns is the government�셲 eagerness to criminalise dissent. At least 140 journalists and writers are now behind bars amid a crackdown on the media since the coup. �쏱rison conditions are dire and no evidence of involvement in the coup has been provided against those held in pre-trial detention, either publicly or in private,�� says Katie Morris, head of Europe and Central Asia for Article 19, the London-based freedom of expression advocates.
With little hope of redress in local courts, it is not surprising that victims are now applying to the European court of human rights, Morris says. One such applicant, the editor and novelist Ahmet Altan, has accused the government not of arresting people involved in the coup but those trying to investigate what really happened. He himself was arrested nearly four months ago but, according to his lawyers, so far there has been no indictment.
Whether European disapproval will have an impact is unclear. When the Justice and Development party (AKP) �� which Erdo휓an helped to found �� came to power in the early 2000s, it advertised itself as proof that Islamic politics could come in from the cold. Rather than lead Turkey away from the west, it would make the country more democratic, more European, and better able to exercise a moderate leadership role on the world stage.
Fifteen years later Turkey seems more isolated than ever. This is partly a result of vacillations over Syria. At first Turkey was at loggerheads with Russia over Moscow�셲 support for President Bashar al-Assad, even coming under an economic embargo when, in 2015, a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian jet. Now it argues with the US over a lack of air support in Syria as Turkish troops try to capture Islamic State strongholds before Syrian Kurdish fighters get there first. In a round of diplomatic sabre-rattling last week, it threatened to expel Nato forces from the key Mediterranean airbase in 칭ncirlik.
An increasingly dire human rights record has weakened the country�셲 international standing and diluted the sympathy which the government might have expected as victim of an attempted coup. As its influence wanes, Turkey has become a breeding ground for conjecture and conspiracy theories �� where everyone else is to blame.
One pro-government newspaper morphed the mugshot of the man suspected of the nightclub assault into a photograph of Barack Obama.
Cold weather and bottlenecks in Turkey�셲 supply of natural gas forced power cuts at the end of 2016, but many secular Turks chose to believe the explanation that a spiteful government was trying to sabotage new year celebrations. Yet on Friday the minister of energy (and the president�셲 son-in-law) announced that the electrical grid had come under cyber-attacks originating in America.
Unlike Russia, which Erdo휓an now courts, Turkey has no oil or natural resource which it can use to keep supporters loyal. Until now the AKP has relied on consumer confidence and building tunnels, bridges or a third Istanbul airport to keep its cronies happy and the economy well oiled. The shopping mall, as much as the mosque, has been the symbol of its era in power.
Now the streets are eerily empty. Even before the Reina massacre, the lira was under attack. The inflation rate is rising, growth is slowing and the markets are pushing up interest rates. �쏷hese are times when investors look for a strong policy response, but the political environment means that this is proving hard to deliver,�� says Murat 횥챌er, economist at consultancy Global Source Partners.
Ever since the coup attempt, Turkey has been under a form of emergency law where the government can rule by decree. The president is now pressing for constitutional changes that would make these powers permanent.
�쏛 democratic presidential system has checks and balances �� this would be one-man rule,�� says Ergun 횜zbudun, a professor of constitutional law who was asked by Erdo휓an, then prime minister, to draw up a constitution in 2007.
However beleaguered Erdo휓an might be, few expect him to back down. �쏽ou may dislike a thing while it is good for you, and you may love a thing while it is evil for you,�� he said in a New Year message to his people �� the implication being that, though they may view the new authoritarianism as a bitter pill, they will grow to love the taste.
The French government has announced a ��425m (짙326m) programme to combat terrorism, two weeks after a series of attacks left 20 dead, including three Islamist gunmen.
Measures announced by the prime minister, Manuel Valls, include greater surveillance to root out terrorist suspects, hundreds more intelligence officers, gendarmes and police, and better equipment for security services.
Three police officers died in the recent attacks in Paris, which started when gunmen stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The programme includes measures to prevent youngsters becoming radicalised, the separation of religious fundamentalists in prisons and the prosecution of those who spread or support terrorism on the internet. Constitutional experts are also looking at whether convicted terrorists who hold dual nationality can be stripped of their French citizenship.
Valls, who was flanked by the justice, foreign, interior and defence ministers as he made the announcement, warned there could be no �쐚ero risk�� against �쐂etermined individuals and well-organised networks��. However, he said the government would fight terrorism with �쐂etermination, perseverance and coherent action��.
France has been on its highest security alert since the terrorist attacks that rocked the country and brought millions on to the streets in demonstrations of support for republican values. About 122,000 police and military personnel �� including 10,500 troops �� have been deployed across France to protect public places.
�쏻e are well aware that the combat against terrorism, jihadism and radical Islamism will be a long battle,�� Valls said, adding that French security services had about 3,000 people under surveillance. Among these were about 1,300 French �� or foreigners living in France �� suspected of links with terrorists networks in Syria and Iraq in the past year. The figure had increased 130% in 12 months, Valls added. Several hundred more were involved in jihadi networks or �쐁yber-jihadism�� on the internet.
�쏷his upping of the [security] level is a tough challenge for our country and our partners, especially those in Europe. It is clear we have to reinforce our cooperation to identify the terrorists and track their movements, as well as reinforce police and legal cooperation with third-party states, particularly those that are transit countries for jihad zones.��
Valls said nearly 2,700 extra people would be employed in the next three years in the war against terrorism, 1,400 in the interior ministry, 950 in the justice ministry, 250 for defence and 80 for the finance ministry, including 70 new customs posts. A total of 1,100 of the new jobs would be in the intelligence services.
The measures would cost ��425m over the next three years, with an additional ��60m spent over the same time period on attempting to prevent youngsters becoming radicalised. Valls added that France had been hit by terrorism �쏿s it has never been hit before��. �쏷his terrible shock has reminded us of the gravity of the threat which our country faces permanently,�� he said.
The prime minister said the battle including addressing racism and antisemitism as well as what he described as unacceptable inequality, a reference to parts of the rundown banlieues with high migrant communities, high poverty rates and rampant unemployment that are seen as breeding grounds for religious extremism. Referring to the rioting that took place in many of these areas in 2005, Valls said: �쏻hen you have such high levels of poverty, where people of similar origins live in similar poverty혻�� it�셲 not a great surprise that these areas become real tinderboxes.
�쏻e are determined to take measures to assure the safety of the French. We are determined to fight against radicalisation혻�� we are determined to restate our values and show in the best way possible that, faced with terror, democracy and the state of law will not give in, will never give in.��
The government's anti-terror law watchdog has become involved in an artist's attempt to use jihadist handbooks and extremist tracts in his work.
Lord Carlile of Berriew has advised Xenofon Kavvadias after the Metropolitan police warned the Greek artist he could be arrested and prosecuted under the Terrorism Act if he mounts an exhibition featuring texts such as The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations, a justification for suicide bombings used by Chechen extremists.
Kavvadias, a graduate of Central St Martins School of Art and Design who has lived in the UK for six years, sought Lord Carlile's advice when he staged his MA degree show, featuring the covers of three extremist texts secured in centimetre-thick clear plastic cases in an attempt to explore the legal boundaries of freedom of expression.
He now wants to install a bookshelf in an art gallery stocked with texts presented in court to secure terrorism convictions. They include Defence of Muslim Lands by Sheikh Abdullah Azzam, a jihadist who influenced Osama bin Laden, The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook, which details how to kill using homemade ricin and how to make poisons from tobacco and potatoes, and the Manual of Afghan Jihad (also known as the al-Qaida Manual), which explains how to plan, finance and execute terror attacks.
Courts have handed down custodial sentences for possession of these and similar documents. Last year Khalid Khaliq, a friend of two of the 7 July 2005 suicide bombers, was jailed for 16 months for possession of the al-Qaida Manual.
Kavvadias says he is a pacifist and has no sympathy with Islamist extremism, but wants "to use art to reclaim something that is lost right now: freedom of publishing and freedom of expression".
He argues that most of the texts he proposes to feature are accessible on the internet and is keen to point out that the broad wording of anti-terrorism legislation criminalises thousands of people who have no criminal intent.
The Met's director of legal services told him the police are "duty bound to investigate acts relating to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism �� this includes offences about the possession, collection or record-keeping of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".
However, Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation since 2005, has offered cautious encouragement to the project. "I am sure there is a visual arts context into which counter-terrorism legislation can be put," he advised. "The best and shortest answer to your question is that you are unlikely to be prosecuted, and if prosecuted not convicted, if you do not break sections 57 and 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 �� I am sorry that I cannot answer your question more directly than that, but I am afraid that the law is no less conceptual than fine art."
Carlile told the Guardian: "Nobody is going to give him a yes or a no on any particular item. If he shows anything that shows somebody who does not know how to make a bomb, then that would be a bad decision."
Kavvadias also placed documents in secure cases in a current exhibition at the 10 Vyner Street gallery, east London. Now he wants to have whole books on display with a reading table and public discussion. "I think having these books in a forum like that and in an art context is something essential for an open and free society," he said. "My grand project is to design a library [of banned books] for each country to create a portrait of a country's demons and fears." He said the law as it stands means thousands of people who have downloaded copies of terrorist-related tracts and handbooks, are inadvertently putting themselves at risk of prosecution, even when they don't have any criminal purpose.
Unless he can secure assurances that he will not be prosecuted under laws that proscribe recklessly inciting others to commit terrorist acts, with a maximum jail term of seven years, he will try to stage the show in the Netherlands.
Those "veterans" spend their time hacking down trees in a vain attempt to carve out a smallholding on land so barren that no crops will grow on it. They own nothing more than the ragged shirts on their backs. Without schooling, employment or hope, they are the real victims of Mugabe's bankrupt regime.
Two things became clear in the two days I spent in Zimbabwe. First, it is obvious that the general election later this month will not be free or fair. It is being rigged. Any pretence to the contrary is misleading and self-serving. And second, most importantly for the immediate future, people from all walks of life opposed to Mugabe are in danger from violence after - as well as before - the election.
Voters in many parts of the country have already been cowed by Mugabe's state terrorism. His thugs have kidnapped, tortured and murdered opponents from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the main opposition party. And these intense and sudden bouts of violence have served as a warning to others.
Whites and blacks told us how units of Zanu-PF thugs have toured the country setting up mobile re-education units, where peasant farmers are corralled and then bullied or beaten into submission. People made it clear that this violence has been planned and controlled by Mugabe personally.
Although the heavies have done most of their dirty work already, there is a real danger that the violence will return, and a specific fear about the safety of opposition candidates and voters in about 10 key constituencies where Mugabe's most powerful cronies are standing. I gave a list of these seats to Robin Cook when I met him this week.
What is more, Zimbabwe's electoral rolls are works of fiction. Tens of thousands of younger voters have been removed because so many are fiercely determined to reclaim their country from Mugabe's vicious grip.
The real question remain ing is whether Zanu-PF's rigging the election will work.
Despite the naked abuse of power by Mugabe, the MDC still believes that it can win enough seats to provide a significant nucleus of opposition. The MDC's members are brave and resolute people, who risk their lives every day by speaking up for their beliefs.
So what can we do? Above all, I was repeatedly told that if Britain and other nations can ensure that election monitors will stay on after the election, people will be reassured that they can cast their votes without fear of reprisals.
Mugabe is hated, but Zimbabwean observers worry that the biggest block to a mass anti-Mugabe vote is fear that after the election he will unleash violence on his own people, as he did in 1985.
Members of the army's notorious fifth brigade, which carried out massacres in Matabeleland in the 80s, have already made public visits to towns and villages where support for the opposition is strongest. The message is chilling and clear. Areas that do not vote for Zanu-PF will be targeted for reprisals.
Britain should quietly co-ordinate a coalition of states and organisations - South Africa, the Commonwealth, the EU, and the US - to press for monitors to stay in the country for several weeks after the elections. In all likelihood, lives - perhaps the lives of Zimbabwe's new generation of leaders - depend on this.
Mugabe himself is immune to influence and diplomacy. But there are things that can be done. Only this week, the MDC has asked the outside world to freeze overseas assets of Mugabe and his cronies. I strongly agree. The world could also target senior members of Zimbabwe's regime with travel bans. They, including Mugabe himself, should be international pariahs if they continue in their present course.
There is also the question of what to do after the election. If Zanu-PF wins the election, and it is clear that the will of the people has been flouted, the Common wealth must move to suspend Zimbabwe forthwith.
Zimbabwe is not all gloom. The country is a success story waiting to happen. One woman I talked to reminded me that both blacks and whites were being struck off the electoral roll in equal numbers because both share a common view of the future, a future without Mugabe.
Africa's generation of Marxist nationalists is giving way. Some, like Mugabe, will not go quietly. The new world that is emerging - both in Africa and Europe - is a world of universal values of democracy, open economies and the rule of law. We need to do our bit to make sure that Zimbabwe can become part of this new world. So far, we have let it down.
While an attentive US audience watched President Obama outline his plan to wind down America's long war on terror last week, officials in Havana were shaking their heads in bewilderment and anger over how the issue of terrorism continues to be cynically manipulated against the island nation. What raised their ire was the recent announcement that Cuba would remain on the State Department's controversial list of states that sponsor terrorism.
The long-awaited annual report on international terrorism from the State Department was released Thursday, and confirmed what officials had already indicated �� that Cuba is staying on the list along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell confirmed the administration "has no current plans to remove Cuba". The decision came as a disappointment for those who were expecting new Secretary of State John Kerry, a long-time critic of America's counter-productive policy against the Castro government, might recommend Cuba's removal. The fact he hasn't demonstrates how difficult it is to change the dynamics of the antagonistic relationship between these two ideological adversaries.
Cuba was originally included on the list in 1982, replacing a then-friendly Iraq. The designation levies comprehensive economic punishments against Havana as part of the overall strategy of regime change that includes a decades-long economic embargo, unrelenting propaganda, extra-territorial application of American laws.
For it's part, Cuba calls its continued inclusion on the list "shameful" and pandering to a small community of former Cuban citizens who now live in Florida. Cuba also asserts that the US has actually undertaken actions on the island that have resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians.
An official of the country's foreign relations department, MINREX, who asked to remain anonymous, complained:
The so-called terrorism against Cuba began shortly after the triumph of the Revolution in 1959. In the early 1960s a covert CIA program known as Operation Mongoose led to the killing of teachers, farmers, government officials and the destruction of agricultural and non-military industrial targets. Other incidents involved attacks on villages, biological terrorism including the introduction of Dengue 2 that resulted in the deaths of more than 100 children in 1981, and a 1997 bombing campaign against tourist facilities in Havana and Varadero that killed Canadian-Italian tourist Fabio Di Celmo and injured dozens.
The most infamous act of terrorism occurred with the bombing of Cubana Airlines in 1976, killing all 72 on board. One of the two recognized masterminds, former CIA agent Luis Posada Carriles, has a long history of suspected terrorist activities against his former homeland; at one point bragging to the New York Times of his involvement in the hotel bombings. Posada continues to live a quiet life in Miami, considered a hero among many of the first generation exiles whose anti-revolutionary fervor has yet to diminish. The other architect of the Cubana Airlines bombing, Orlando Bosch, died peacefully in Miami a few years ago. As a result of these terrorist activities, the Cuban government sent intelligence officers to Florida in the 1990s to infiltrate Cuban-American organizations in an effort to thwart further acts. The agents, known as the Cuban Five, were uncovered by the FBI and are serving long prison terms.
While Cuba's status as a state sponsor of terrorism remains unchanged, other countries that might be considered more deserving, such as North Korea and Pakistan, aren't on the list. What makes it all the more galling for the Castro government are the arguments the United States has advanced to justify Cuba's inclusion �� the most egregious stemming from the charge Cuba was not sufficiently supportive of the US war on terror or the invasion of Iraq, and was unwilling to help track or seize assets allegedly held by terrorists. A 2004 State Department report asserted that "Cuba continued to actively oppose the US-led coalition prosecuting the global war on terrorism." In reality, the Cuban side has consistently denounced all forms of terrorism, including the recent Boston Marathon bombings that brought quick condolences from the island leadership.
Other rationales over the past 30 years to keep Cuba on the list have ranged from its support for left-wing rebels in Latin America, its relationship with the former Soviet Union, treatment of political prisoners and allowing members from alleged terrorist organizations such as Columbia's FARC and Spain's separatist Basque movement ETA to reside on the island. Even when those issues were resolved, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union more than 20 years ago, Cuba found its unmerited designation had not changed.
One long standing reason, that Havana permits refugees from American justice to find safe haven on the island, was re-invigorated with a ruling that was timed almost perfectly with the announcement that Cuba would not be taken off the terrorist list. Assata Shakur, accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper 40 years ago, was suddenly labeled as a most wanted terrorist by the FBI, with a $2m price tag on her head. Shakur, who fled to Cuba in 1979 and was given political asylum, has consistently maintained her innocence. Categorizing Shakur as a terrorist could potentially endanger her life from those wanting to collect the bounty, and has led State Department officials to utilize her changed status as justification to keep Cuba on the list.
There is no legitimate reason to use the arbitrary terrorism list as a political weapon against Cuba. To continue to do so simply exposes the State Department to charges of hypocrisy and manipulation of a serious threat based solely on ideological differences. Most importantly, it gives insult to all those who have been actual victims of terrorism.
Donald Trump has accused Qatar of sponsoring terrorism at the highest levels, in an extraordinary escalation of the diplomatic row with one America�셲 most important military partners in the Middle East.
Speaking in the White House rose garden on Friday, Trump said he had decided �쐔he time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding �� and its extremist ideology.��
His comments marked his most forthright intervention in a crisis triggered on Monday when Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies launched a co-ordinated diplomatic and economic campaign to isolate Qatar.
Earlier this week, the US president appeared to take credit for the blockade in a string of tweets.
On Friday, Trump said that Arab leaders he met in Saudi Arabia last month had urged him to challenge Qatar, which they accuse of backing extremist groups and cosying up to Iran.
�쏶o we had a decision to make: do we take the easy road, or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism,�� he said. �쏷he nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.��
Trump�셲 intervention came after Saudi Arabia and its allies on Friday sanctioned a dozen organisations and 59 people it accused of links to Islamist militancy �� a number of them Qataris or with links to Qatar.
The Qatari government said in a statement on Friday: �쏻e do not, have not and will not support terrorist groups.��
US relations with Qatar have long been complicated by Doha�셲 promotion of a conservative form of Sunni Islam, but the tiny Gulf state is also a close military partner. More than 11,000 US and coalition forces are at al-Udeid air base outside Doha, which is the centre for US air operations over Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Qatar had previously called on Trump to intervene decisively, saying he was �쐁rucial�� to resolving the crisis.
On Thursday, Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar�셲 ambassador to the US, said: �쏻e believe in his ability to calm this crisis down. We are courageous enough to acknowledge if things need to be amended.��
But Trump�셲 tone struck a marked contrast with comments by the US secretary of state, who just an hour earlier urged Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain to ease their blockade of Qatar.
In a brief statement to reporters, Rex Tillerson said that the blockade was hampering US military efforts against Islamic State and causing unintended humanitarian consequences.
Tillerson said the US would support efforts to mediate the row, but also said Qatar must do more to crack down on support for terror.
�쏷he emir of Qatar has made progress in halting financial support and expelling terrorists from his country, but he must do more and he must do it more quickly.��
The UAE�셲 ambassador to Washington welcomed Trump�셲 comments. �쏷he UAE welcomes President Trump�셲 leadership in challenging Qatar�셲 troubling support for extremism. The next step is for Qatar to acknowledge these concerns and commit to re-examine its regional policies,�� said Yousef Al Otaiba, according to Reuters.
Ben Rhodes, who served as Barack Obama�셲 deputy national security adviser, said Trump�셲 remarks on the crisis were especially confounding because there appeared to be no official US strategy.
�쏷here�셲 no explanation for why he�셲 doing what he�셲 doing,�� Rhodes said, warning that Trump�셲 loose words threatened counter-terrorism operations against Isis, US troops stationed in the region, and risked the escalation of conflict with Iran.
�쏷here�셲 a short-term risk of increased danger to our national security objectives, and then there�셲 a longer term risk of escalating conflicts on many fronts,�� Rhodes said. �쏧n the Middle East, it�셲 always a mistake to think that things can�셳 get worse.��
Qatar�셲 foreign minister described the blockade as a violation of international law and said there was an attempt to mobilise international opinion against the Gulf emirate. �쏷hese procedures that were taken have clear violations of international law and international humanitarian law. They will not have a positive impact on the region but a negative one,�� Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters on Friday during a visit to Germany.
Included on the Saudi sanctions list �� which was denounced as �쐀aseless and without foundation in fact�� by Qatar �� are the Qatari-funded Qatar Charity and Eid Charity, and several prominent figures including businessmen, politicians and senior members of the ruling family, one a former interior minister.
The list also includes the Muslim Brotherhood�셲 spiritual leader, Youssef al-Qaradawi, who is based in Doha, and individuals in Libya as well as Shia groups in Bahrain seen by some Gulf Arab governments as linked to Iran.
The sanctions list further tightens the screws on Qatar, home to a key US military base and the host of the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
It also strongly suggests a widening of the aggressive Saudi-led campaign beyond Qatar itself �� not least against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt �� where Youssef al-Qaradawi was tried and sentenced to death in absentia following the 2013 military overthrow of the elected president Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood member.
Although Qatar has long denied supporting or funding terror groups, western diplomats have accused it of allowing the funding of some Sunni extremists, such as al-Qaida�셲 branch in Syria. The same accusations have been levelled against individuals in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
A leading diplomat from the UAE told the Guardian on Thursday that the Gulf states had lost all trust in Qatar.
Omar Saif Ghobas, the UAE�셲 ambassador to Russia, said: �쏷here is no trust, it has gone. So when the Qatari foreign minister says, �쁋isten, we need to engage in dialogue,�� we have done that for many years �� that�셲 just a statement for western consumption.��
The crisis has provoked anxieties in Qatar, a leading gas exporter as well as an international travel hub, whose flagship carrier Qatar Airways has been forced to fly circuitous and expensive routes over Iran and Turkey after being blocked elsewhere in the Middle East.
In August, when Chris Norman was receiving France�셲 highest accolade, the L챕gion d�셡onneur, for foiling a suspected jihadi gunman on a train, he cannot have realised how, within three months, his act of extraordinary bravery would be pulled into sharp focus by the Paris terror attacks.
The British businessman became a national celebrity in his adopted country after helping three off-duty US soldiers wrestle the would-be gunman to the ground on an Amsterdam to Paris express train. Twelve weeks later, as the French capital was coming to terms with the scale of the bloodshed in the Bataclan theatre and on its streets, Norman learned that the terror cell�셲 ringleader was being linked with the train attacker he had confronted.
Norman says it took a day for the horror of the Paris attacks to sink in. �쏧 was �� how can I put it? Quite strongly affected,�� he told the Guardian in a wide-ranging interview in which he looked back on an extraordinary year and discussed how he considers France to be changing.
The impact of the 13 November attacks on Norman deepened when he found out that he knew two of the Bataclan victims: the young restaurateurs Pierre Innocenti and St챕phane Albertini.
�쏷hen, fundamentally you realise that you can�셳 let something like that stop you from carrying on living,�� Norman said. Nevertheless, he admits that life has changed since the drama on the Thalys express train on 21 August, which means he is occasionally recognised by strangers.
As for personal security, he admits to having spent a bit of time with friends in the police and military �쐔hinking of what we would do��, but adds with a relaxed chuckle: �쏧n the end we bought a big dog. It�셲 a bit of protection but there are quite a few radicalised people in the towns nearby.��
Rather, he has found himself thinking about the root causes for the behaviour of the train suspect, Ayoub el-Khazzani, and cites reports that Khazzani was linked to the supposed mastermind of events in the French capital weeks later.
�쏻hat also really hit me was Paris because, a couple of times I actually said to the guys �쁳his is just the beginning��, and then it turned out the terrorist we were actually involved with was driven by the same guy who was involved in the Paris attacks.
�쏷he reaction I have now is that I need to understand why [Khazzani] was doing it. I had him in front of me and his eyes were just blank. He didn�셳 say a word during the whole thing. So now I am interested in finding out more about why someone would want to do it.��
That quest for answers is also shaping Norman�셲 business, which works with entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa. �쏮y thoughts were that I should continue to do it because, if you look at the flow of migrants for example �� essentially the dispossessed who are coming into Europe at the moment �� that is a hotbed for the sort of thing that happened.��
One project with which he has recently become involved is attempting to increase agricultural production in the Sahel-Sahara region, and potentially halt desertification.
Looking around his adopted country, Norman says France is in the process of changing. At his local rugby club �� a personal rock of support and the place to where he was driving when he learned of the Paris attacks �� he believes that some have found an echo in the Front National for their concerns.
While he has no time for the far-right party �� �쏧 was born in Uganda, grew up in Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa and left South Africa because of profound disagreement with apartheid�� �� he characterises recent changes in France as �쐍ot so much a question of being anti-Muslim, but being so dead tired about having to be politically correct��.
For instance, he suggests that the return of national service, though not necessarily solely in the military, could encourage civic responsibility, preparedness for emergencies and ensure that different classes and ethnicities mix more. He says his younger self would disapprove of such an idea.
Norman, who has a son on a French naval carrier currently taking part in anti-Isis operations in the Middle East, also says he is intrigued to see how powers handed to the police and military under France�셲 state of emergency develop.
�쏰ne of the things we were able to do on the train was take the guy alive. You then get in to the question of: �쁃id he actually tell them anything that was useful? Would he have if they had been allowed to be a bit more forceful?�� I don�셳 know.��
The day after the day after and it doesn�셳 get any easier. The blast, the momentary terrible silence and then the screams of the wounded. All of us are now screaming into that silence because we can imagine it only too well. And what we cannot imagine parts of the media will show us, even if we don�셳 want to see. Small bodies ripped apart. The smiles of young girls, now dead. The superfan messages. The beautiful young gay man. Excited selfies of pure youth. All the love flows towards these people, to their families, to the emergency services and to the city enduring this tragedy.
We shall overcome and we shall overcome by carrying on as normal, by our small acts of humanity. This is one reaction. Yet the presence of soldiers on our streets is not carrying on as normal.
For there is anger now and the message of love as resistance is not enough for many. From those who troll for a living, from Piers Morgan to Katie Hopkins, there emerges yet more hate figures and this hate spirals. Exactly the aim of terror. Morrissey, who has made the strange journey from icon to embarrassment, from Manchester to LA, once more reveals he is closer to Nigel Farage then Oscar Wilde. Immigration is at the root of this horror, he suggests, though he is the son of immigrants himself.
Does it matter what a fallen idol says? Not so much, but it certainly chimes with the view that good Muslims should drive out the bad Muslims. With Trump attempting to sword dance in Saudi Arabia while he sells the country arms, it�셲 quite hard to know who qualifies as �쐀ad Muslims�� sometimes, isn�셳 it?
What we do know for sure is that this attack reverses the recent trend for low-tech terrorism because a suicide belt is a more sophisticated way of killing than a stolen truck. However, the targeting of women and gay people is not new. We saw it in a plot foiled 15 years ago, which targeted the Ministry of Sound nightclub. The aim was to kill �쐓lags��. And last year we saw the terrible shooting in Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando.
When I first heard the awful news about Manchester, of course I thought it had been carried out by some disturbed man. Male violence is a given. This is not to say that all men are terrorists, but if we cannot identify the connection between these acts of violence and the construction of a kind of masculinity that so-called �쐒adicalisation�� offers uncertain young men then we cannot combat it. It seems that we can look at foreign policy in all its complexity as providing fertile territory for jihadi recruitment, from the shattering of Libya to what�셲 happening in Yemen. But it�셲 not enough. We can pore over sacred texts to be told that jihad is not legitimate, but that�셲 not right either. Indeed, this is to act as if all these murderers are inspired by religion and a complex understanding of global politics. We know this not to be true.
Often, however, the attackers are converts to Islam or have only recently become devout. They do things that good Muslims must not do, from smoking dope to visiting sex workers. Often their families have been broken in some way. There may be a history of petty crime. Domestic violence figures strongly in the background of some of the perpetrators.
These men are not all lone operators. In fact radicalisation is social whether online or face to face. It is perhaps their only real connection.
They share a hatred of women and gay people as less than human, as completely �쐎ther��. The desires that they provoke means they must be destroyed. Deep-seated misogyny is not exclusive to the idiots of Isis. Think of the American high-school shooters who often express these feelings.
Often when men kill women there have been signs and they have talked to other men about it. The police know this. We see this pattern over and over again: alienated young men withdrawing, unable to deal with their own inadequacies, drawn into gangs that provide meaning and purpose. Am I comparing Isis to a criminal gang? Absolutely. One that we know preaches extreme misogyny.
The plea to then answer this with love becomes hard to take. Resistance to this terror also has to take the form of resistance to misogyny of all kinds, to fight for the rights of women and gay people the world over. This can�셳 only be done by choosing love, it is part of a longer struggle where there never is a return to normality. Sure, in the short term, it would be better to have an election without the army on the streets.
But there is a parallel politics of living in which we fight for the very things these murderers cannot stand by being them: girls having fun while their dads wait for them. Young women taking full possession of themselves. Gay people high on life. Mothers watching their daughters go wild. Our ability to do this now is because others have fought for these �쐄reedoms��. So now we continue, all while grieving and full of anger. And as we have in the past, we keep on dancing.
When they kicked down the door of the living room of a house in the western Iraqi city of Falluja on Friday, US marines from the 3/5 Lima Company discovered an improvised television studio equipped with video cameras, banks of computers and cutting-edge editing equipment.
According to Captain Ed Batinga, who led the soldiers, an off-white wall behind a wooden table at one side of the room was spattered with blood and draped with the black-and-gold flag of the Islamic militant group believed to be behind the killing of dozens of hostages in Iraq in recent months.
The marines were too late to save Margaret Hassan, a slim, spry, 59-year-old Irish-born woman who had lived in Iraq for 32 years, and was shot dead at point-blank range by an Iraqi insurgent some time last week. She had been held captive for nearly a month and died dressed in a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit.
The first and last act of Mrs Hassan's abductors was to release a videotape. The first reached the television station al-Jazeera within hours of Mrs Hassan being taken hostage. The last, which has not yet been broadcast, shows her death.
The videos are one of the most shocking elements of the war in Iraq. Scores have now been released by Iraqi insurgents. To many the terrorists' use of the media seems a radical innovation. It isn't. The Iraqi videos are part of a genre of propaganda tools developed over decades. This is simply the moment that the terrorist film-makers have started to reach a mass audience. In the longer term, the videos are rooted in the essence of the militants' project, which is the project of all terrorists - dramatic spectacle. Or, put another way, theatre.
Videos have become the most potent weapon of modern Islamic militants. They realised long ago that al-Qaeda and its offshoots could not take on the military might of the US and its allies. But when it comes to propaganda - the key battlefield in the 'war on terror' - the advantage clearly lies with the militants. Cheap and easy-to-use video cameras, digitalisation, CD-burners, plus the demands of 24-hour rolling news, means that anyone now has access to the airwaves. Home videos end up being broadcast to hundreds of millions.
The intense competition between groups for airtime and attention goes some way to explaining the savagery of the acts committed to film by insurgent groups in Iraq in recent months. In the past two weeks, all over Iraq and particularly in the area where Mrs Hassan was killed, there has been violence of an extraordinary intensity. The insurgents know that for a single, small group of men, lightly armed in conventional terms, to grab the attention of their audience they need to do something utterly atrocious.
The terrorists have become auteurs, mini film directors. Early on, in the Eighties, their videos were basic, consisting of little more than the speeches of radical leaders spliced with news footage of the war in Afghanistan against the Soviets. They were, however, effective. Many of the militants I've interviewed have described how they were first inspired by seeing one of the crude recruitment videos in circulation at the time.
By the end of the Afghan war, however, as the cadres spread out through the Islamic world and to the West, the videos started to get more violent. The first one I came across, while investigating fundraising in the UK for Algerian Islamic militants in 1993, was fairly amateurish. It featured footage of a night raid on an army post, which was too dark to see, followed by a series of full-screen Koranic quotations to the soundtrack of an attack on the convoy of a government minister. Words filled the screen as the shooting and shouting raged.
Over the following years, the tapes proliferated, many devoted to the fighting in Bosnia and in Chechnya. They followed a standard formula, showing clips of training or combat, 'mujahideen' praying and preachers lecturing. The less violent among them were sold, openly, in mosques or over the internet. Through the mid-Nineties the militants, influenced by Osama bin Laden, improved their film-making. Bin Laden, who has a natural talent for media and marketing, knew instinctively how to construct effective, professional packages full of powerful, mythical references and language that would plug straight into widely felt, though often unspoken, sentiments in the Islamic world. His press conferences were carefully managed with extras brought in to bulk up the crowds of acolytes and footage viewed before release.
Bin Laden also knew the value of television coverage of events, arranging for actual attacks, such as that on an American destroyer in October 2000, to be filmed wherever possible. The 11 September strikes, which were guaranteed massive media coverage, were the culmination of this process. The Arabic word for martyr (and, incidentally, the Greek word too) also means witness, as in someone who, by their actions or speech, makes a hidden truth clear to an audience. There was no doubt that the 11 September attacks would have an audience.
From the mid-Nineties, death began to feature more prominently in the videos. A few years before the 2001 strikes, bin Laden copied Lebanese groups and had militants record a last will and testament before a suicide mission. The format of one young man speaking directly to camera was extremely intimate - the equivalent of a soliloquy. His words, almost always formulaic and banal, did not matter. The power of the videos lay in the fact that the audience were thrilled and fascinated by the knowledge that they were watching a man who knew he was going to die and who was probably dead at the time of broadcast. Death was not shown but was present all the same. Such videos continue to be made and are frequently posted on the internet. Some of the 11 September hijackers' wills are available. So are those of men responsible for attacking Western-run installations in Saudi Arabia last year.
At the beginning of 2002 I picked up another video produced by an Algerian militant group in London and circulating, secretly, at the Finsbury Park mosque. This one was professionally produced and showed, in graphic detail, wounded Algerian soldiers having their throats cut after an ambush. When I watched it for the first time on a television in the Observer newsroom, a small crowd gathered. At around the same time, a video was released in Pakistan of the death of Daniel Pearl, an American journalist abducted by a militant group. Pearl was already dead when, in the video, his throat was cut with a kitchen knife.
The execution videos in Iraq combine all the tried-and-tested elements of the genre. They are dramatic productions. There is the main subject centre stage, there is a carefully designed set and backdrop and there are carefully chosen props, such as the cage that Kenneth Bigley appeared in, that send particular messages to particular audiences. In recent videos, there is even a script, carefully drafted statements that have to be read out by victims, often in a hideous duet with their killer.
Many of the recent videos have been hastily produced - presumably because the hostage takers are under massive military pressure - and lack the slick production of other propaganda films. But they still wield considerable emotional power. One of the more sophisticated recent films I have seen depicted the killing of an alleged spy and featured cutting-edge editing techniques that allowed footage from the cockpit of an American jet showing a missile being fired into a crowd of Iraqis to be spliced with pictures of the man's supposed confession and his eventual beheading.
The aim of modern Islamic militancy is not to achieve specific goals, such as the release of a prisoner or the repeal of a law, but to radicalise and mobilise those who have hitherto shunned the militants' extremist message. Bin Laden et al are focused not on tangible political gain but on a cosmic, millennia-long struggle between good and evil. This was what underpinned the attacks of 11 September. The primary aim was not to kill infidels or damage the economy, though both were welcome effects of the strategy, but to mobilise the masses. As Jean Baudrillard, the French critical theorist, commented of 11 September: 'We are far beyond politics or ideology now... the aim is to radicalise the world by sacrifice.' Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's partner in crime, has warned against 'volunteers getting killed in silence'. There's no point in the theatre if no one goes to see it.
This is not new. In 1880, a German anarchist called Johannes Most wrote a pamphlet called Philosophy of the Bomb. 'Outrageous violence,' he said, 'will seize the imagination of the public and awaken its audience to political issues.' In the same period, Polish socialists coined the phrase 'propaganda by deed'. The German terrorists of the 1970s spoke of shocking the masses out of their consumerist apolitical apathy - by blowing up supermarkets.
Terrorism - and this includes spectacularly publicised events such as 11 September as well as videoed executions - has always needed an audience. Bomb blasts on symbolic targets and killings on camera are dramatic productions designed to elicit an emotional response - just like theatre.
Karl Heinz Stockhausen, the composer, and Damien Hirst, the artist, both recognised this when they controversially described the demolition of the Twin Towers as 'a work of art'. It has even been recognised in the dry, hard-nosed world of counter-terrorism where agents continually talk of their fears of a 'spectacular', meaning something so big it becomes a mass spectacle.
And the theatrical analogy goes further. A kidnapping obeys the classical tragic dramatic structure, with a startling opening scene, a series of well defined, almost ritualised passages, and then a cathartic dramatic ending. Last year Chechen terrorists actually took over a theatre, acting out their drama on a real stage. In Mrs Hassan's case, the stage is a house in Falluja and the proscenium arch is our television screen.
Mrs Hassan's killers imagine the audience for their carefully constructed drama in two parts: the Muslim world in the stalls, the West in the cheap seats. The aim is to challenge both parts, provoking a different response in each.
To those in the front rows, the videos are designed to inspire them to action. They're recruitment videos. 'Look at the measures we are forced to take on your part,' the militants are saying. 'Think about why we have to do this, appreciate the seriousness of the situation, rise up, brothers, rise up.'
The killers are of course aware that what they are doing is deeply controversial - as the overwhelmingly negative reaction from most Muslims has shown - and so include a series of visual signs, such as the orange jumpsuit and references to Islamic religious history and tradition. The very act of throat-cutting will, they hope, legitimise their actions.
The message is also directed at other militant groups and potential donors. The high-profile militant leader wins recruits, more money and thus more capability in the future. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is thought to have murdered Kenneth Bigley, is also stressing his willingness to kill with his own hands - in contrast to bin Laden who is up in a cave on a mountain sending others out to die for him. There is a game of terrorist one-upmanship going on. Whoever killed Mrs Hassan - and the identity of the killers is not yet known - was saying that they were prepared to kill anyone. Even a female aid worker who was an Iraqi citizen, spoke fluent Arabic and was loved for devoting decades of her life to helping the Iraqi people.
The message for the West is different. The execution videos invade our consciousness. They are shocking and distressing. Even if we don't watch them, their very existence is upsetting. This is crucial. We watch human beings begging for their lives and we feel complicit.
Militants believe they are engaged in a last-ditch defence against an aggressive, belligerent West that has never abandoned the project of the Crusades and is committed to the invasion of Islamic lands. That invasion is both physical - as in Iraq - and cultural.
The spearhead of that invasion, in the last decade, has been the image. Few homes in the Middle East are without a television or access to one. With modern satellite technology this means that Western television - MTV, porn, Italian talk shows, the BBC, football - has arrived in the most intimate domestic space in the traditional Middle Eastern household. In previous decades, and indeed over centuries, interaction between East and West was smoother. Traders went to and fro, books were translated, technologies and values were appropriated when useful and changed to fit local customs. Even colonial administrations were careful not to enter the private sphere. So modern television is an unprecedented invasion of local, Islamic and private space.
What the execution videos have done is take our technology, the spearhead of our invasion, and turned it back on us - exactly as the high-tech passenger jets that so epitomise the modern world were turned on New York. And we don't like it. We are used to controlling the output on our screens. Indeed every development with the media in recent years has been aimed at increasing our control over the material we watch. Now, suddenly someone else is manipulating us, placing material in our way that is deeply challenging and won't just go away.
The executions are now cascading onto the internet. They are half-shown by our own news organisations on the screens that are now in our pubs, in so many of our public spaces, in our kitchens and bedrooms, even on our mobile phones. Our favourite, friendly non-threatening medium has suddenly been subverted and we are yet to reassert control. Turning off the TV is no answer. Refusing to broadcast the video doesn't make any difference. The videos exist. We feel compelled to watch them even when we'd rather not. We are in the unwilling audience.
The risk is that we will become desensitised. Over the period that jihadi videos have been developed as a genre by the terrorists, hardcore porn sites and major release films and video games depicting graphic, if fictional, scenes of mayhem have also become far more common. There is a parallel in the proliferation in the pornography of violence and that of sex. Have a look at any number of American websites where 'rape videos' and clips of road and train accidents are available alongside dozens of the hostage and execution videos released by the insurgents over this year. When you subscribe you get access to both. Once, you may remember, images of life-taking were very rare.
Propaganda, indeed any communication or creative work, only functions in a language that is comprehensible to its target audiences. The harsh truth is that the style of al-Qaeda's attacks and the executions in Iraq - and the whole theatre of modern terrorism - is familiar to us. The question is whether the content soon will be too.

Students who witnessed anti-terror raids on Liverpool John Moores University have described their fears that one of the arrested men was carrying a bomb.
The raids, which were supposed to have been carried out at 2am today, were brought forward to 5pm yesterday after former Met anti-terror chief Bob Quick inadvertently leaked details of the operation.
Although Merseyside police said only one man was arrested at the university, several student witnesses told the Guardian they had seen two men held. Twelve men have been arrested in total across northern England.
Marcel Deer, a third-year journalism student watching the raids from the top floor of the library, said one of those arrested had been wearing a backpack which he feared might contain explosives.
"There was an announcement over the Tannoy that there was a police situation outside and to stay away from the glass windows," he said. "It made everyone scared because we could see from a distance two foreign-looking guys with their hands tied behind their backs face down on the floor surrounded by four armed police officers. It was worrying because they wouldn't tell us what was going on.
"People were saying it was terrorism and my initial thought was, what if there's any others inside? One had a backpack and you immediately thought 'bomb'. They looked like they could have been students."
Andy Garner, another final-year journalism student, was at a bank when the raid took place. "Two minutes later there were police with machine guns walking towards me. They told us to stay behind barriers. It was all a bit surreal. People were shouting it was a terrorist attack."
Maz Chowdhury, a business and finance master's student, said: "My friend saw the guys fall to the floor and police come with guns. We were afraid when we heard on the news they were from Pakistan because we have people in our class from there, but it wasn't them.
"I'm born and brought up in Liverpool and we've never had problems like this before, not like Oldham or Burnley. Liverpool is multicultural, with a high percentage of Muslims �� This is something new."
Naeem Shah, a final-year MBA student from Pakistan, said the arrests might prevent students from Pakistan from coming to study in the UK. "It will create a doubt in the minds of students from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and all over that they wouldn't be safe in the UK. It makes me feel more unsafe. You don't know what the future of Pakistani students here will now be."
Shuja Khan, a Pakistani PhD student visiting from Leicester University, agreed that the raids would deter overseas students from coming to the UK. "We came to this country with the hope that they will protect us," he said.
The attacks began decades ago. The assailants used knives, guns, even grenades. They ambushed police officers and officials in places few had heard of: Akto, Kuqa, Xinhe and other dusty counties in Xinjiang, a sprawling region in China's north-west. State media would issue a pithy statement about the violence, and the rest of the country would shrug its shoulders and march on.
But in recent months the spasms of public violence have spread beyond Xinjiang's borders, raising concerns nationwide about the government's ability to keep its citizens safe. Assailants armed with knives and bombs have struck at three major train stations since March. Authorities blamed the first two incidents on Muslim Uighur "terrorists" from the region, intent on waging holy war.
So on Tuesday when a knife-wielding man wounded six people at a train station in the southern city of Guangzhou, people immediately assumed the worst. While the attacker's identity and motives remained unclear �� police shot and detained him at the scene �� security authorities snapped into damage control mode. That night, three high-ranking public security officials paid separate inspection visits to railway stations in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Changsha. In the central city of Zhengzhou, about 100,000 police, security guards and firefighters paraded through the streets, setting up roadblocks and inspecting hotels and internet cafes.
Experts say that without resolving Xinjiang's underlying problems, the shows of force may be only a patch. Uighur groups abroad call the attacks a cry of despair caused by religious repression and economic marginalisation. The government defends its regional policies as open and tolerant, blaming the attacks on "separatists" and "hostile forces" from abroad.
"Perhaps each of these incidents has its own rationale, its own origins," said Yitzhak Shichor, a Xinjiang expert at the University of Haifa in Israel. "But these attackers certainly could not imagine that they could overcome the system. They went in with the idea that they were going to lose, given the balance of power. And this is an indication that these people feel they have no choice. They're people who have been backed into a corner, and they have nothing to lose."
China's terrorism problem is getting worse, according to the official China National Security Studies annual report for 2013, released this week. Last year marked a particularly active period for attacks, "whether you're looking at the number of them or their severity", Wu Shaozhong, a professor at the Chinese People's Public Security University, wrote in the report.
In late April, a quarter of Shanghai's police began carrying guns during regular patrols. Some Beijing subway stations have stepped up security checks, conducting X-ray scans of passengers as well as their bags.
Magnus Ranstorp, of the Swedish National Defence College, said measures such as patrols were never sufficient in countering terrorism but were one part of the response. He said exchanging ideas internationally could help. "The US and Canada have huge experience with school shootings and have active shooter protocols based on research. If you can't prevent it, how do you take the person out?"
Some experts say that an ongoing security crackdown in Xinjiang often takes the form of increased repression, which in turn fuels more social unrest. "There's a rage against the state, which is sometimes expressed in religious terms," said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. "Mosques are being damaged, women being told to take off their veils, people being told to report other people with long beards �� clearly the religious element is causing friction."
Last Wednesday, two Uighur attackers detonated explosives at a train station in Xinjiang's regional capital, Urumqi, killing themselves and one other person. In March, five assailants turned a train station in the south-west city of Kunming into a scene of carnage, slashing and hacking 29 people to death. Authorities responded to both incidents by vowing to step up anti-terror campaigns in the region.
The government must "make terrorists like rats scurrying across a street, with everybody shouting 'beat them'," the president, Xi Jinping, said in late April before a trip to the ethnically riven city Kashgar.
Experts say the unpredictability, even spontaneity of many attacks make them difficult to pre-empt, both in China and abroad. James Leibold, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, said events such as the Oklahoma City and Boston marathon bombings had made Americans aware that "if a small group of people are intent on carrying out a terror event, it is hard to stop them".
He added: "If it's one guy with a knife and the will to do it, how do you stop someone like that?"

Singers Jennifer Lopez and Pink also sent messages of support. On Tuesday afternoon, Rihanna added:
Johnny Marr, former Smiths guitarist and stalwart of Manchester�셲 music scene, tweeted �쏮anchester stands together��.
Guy Garvey, the broadcaster and singer with Elbow tweeted: �쏮y hearts broken.��
The legendary Manchester band New Order tweeted in the early hours of Tuesday morning:

A senior CNN executive has flown to Nairobi to apologise for coverage calling the country a �쐆otbed of terror�� ahead of Barack Obama�셲 visit in July.
Many Kenyans were outraged by the report, which suggested Obama was likely to be attacked during his historic visit to the land of his father�셲 birth.
While the country has suffered a string of atrocities by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab militant group, most of Kenya does not resemble the parts of the world where terror attacks are commonplace, stressed Kenya�셲 active Twitter community.
The hashtag #someonetellcnn trended for several days ahead of the US president�셲 arrival, visit with users deploying a mix of humour and satire to criticise the American network.
Tony Maddox, a CNN executive vice president and managing director, said the channel could have covered the story differently.
�쏻e acknowledge there is a widespread feeling that the report annoyed many, which is why we pulled down the report as soon as we noticed,�� he said.
�쏧t wasn�셳 a deliberate attempt to portray Kenya negatively, it is regrettable and we shouldn�셳 have done it. There is a world at war with extremists; we know what a hotbed of terror looks like, and Kenya isn�셳 one.��
Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta�셲 press team issued a statement with the headline CNN regrets �쁥otbed of terror�� gaffe, written in unusually triumphal terms. It said the president had expressed �쐆is deep disappointment at the story�� which had �쏿ngered the people of Kenya��.
�쏧n one stroke, CNN�셲 description of Kenya as a �쁥otbed of terror�� undermined the sacrifices made by our Kenyan troops [in Somalia], and the value of hundreds of lives lost, and relegated them to nothing. That�셲 why Kenyans, as expressed by those on Twitter, were so angry. Kenya is nothing like the countries that have real war. There was no reason to portray Kenya in that way,�� the president was quoted as telling the CNN executive.
The Kenya Tourism Board cancelled an advertising campaign it planned to run on CNN aimed at luring tourists back to the country following the story. Tourism is a key foreign exchange earner for Kenya but travel advisories and repeated Shabaab attacks have led to a downturn in recent years.
Kenya has one of the most vibrant media environments on the continent and its Twitter community has emerged in recent months as a major source of news with its frequent and vigorous online campaigns.
A recent target for its ire was the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. His ill-tempered exchange with a Kenyan Twitter user who had urged him not to extend his stay in office spawned a hashtag #someonetellkagame, which was one of the top trending subjects in Kenya.
The move was sanctioned late on Monday after high level meetings at Scotland Yard headed by Assistant Commissioner David Veness, who requested immediate army back-up and support from Heathrow's neighbouring forces, Surrey and Thames Valley.
The prime minister was told of the threat and rubber stamped the deployment of 450 soldiers from the Ist Battalion the Grenadier Guards and the Household Cavalry.
Diverted from training exercises, the troops and several Scimitar armoured vehicles swept on to the site before dawn yesterday, helping police patrol Heathrow's sprawling perimeter fence and nearby open spaces, including Windsor Great Park, from where missiles might be launched.
Police searched cars coming into Heathrow and stopped vehicles under the flightpath near the village of Wraysbury in Berkshire, a few miles from the airport.
Sources insisted that the intelligence reports were credible.
"We wouldn't do this without extremely good reason, I can assure you," said one. "Our aim is to disrupt a potential terrorist attack."
Investigators regard the Heathrow threat as more significant than the alert following the discovery of ricin in north London last month because the warnings refer to a specific target within a specific time limit. They indicated it was the most worrying terrorist threat to Britain since September 11.
Investigators considered closing Heathrow but feared this would be a regarded as a victory for terrorism.
Police said they believed the threat could be related to the Muslim festival of sacrifice, Eid al-Adha, which began yesterday and ends on Friday.
"The current strengthening of security is precautionary and is related to action being taken in other countries and the possibility that the end of the religious festival of Eid may be erroneously used by al-Qaida and associated networks to mount attacks," a Scotland Yard statement said.
The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, said the terrorist threat level was "high".
"Take it from me, the need for doing this is there," he said. "It is necessary for the safety of Londoners and people visiting this capital city."
Though the intelligence reports named Heathrow, several buildings in London were also given extra security. Police fear that potential terrorists might refocus their efforts away from Heathrow and hope to deter them by increasing the number of uniformed officers in parts of the capital.
The deployment of troops followed a tip-off from MI5 to Scotland Yard. It received specific intelligence which pointed to a missile attack on Heathrow and indicated it could come from a "portable" weapon. An attack involving high explosive is also a possibility.
"Al-Qaida has an interest in airports," said a source.
Intelligence sources referred to the attacks in Mombasa last November when two shoulder-mounted Sam-7 missiles were fired at an Israeli airliner carrying 270 passengers shortly after it took off. In a simultaneous attack, 13 people were killed, including three Israelis, when suicide bombers blew themselves up at a nearby hotel.
Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network claimed responsibility for both attacks, according to a tape broadcast by the Gulf television station al-Jazeera yesterday.
Training in the use of the Russian-designed surface to air missiles, which have a range of three miles, is also known to have been given at al-Qaida training camps.
The network is also thought to have had 200-300 ageing Stinger missiles, acquired indirectly from the CIA in the 1980s during the conflict between the mojahedin and Soviet forces.
Though it is unclear how a missile could have been smuggled into Britain, anti-terrorist investigators highlighted the case of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian arrested on the US-Canadian border in December 1999 after powerful explosive materials were found in his car. He was later convicted of plotting an attack on Los Angeles airport. Under questioning, Ressam named a number of alleged al-Qaida supporters, including Abu Doha, now in a British jail.
Downing Street stressed the need not to overreact and "do the terrorists' job for them" by ruining normal life.
But officials were dismissive of suggestions that the airport alert might be a public relations exercise. "These issues are far too important to mess around with," one said.
Heathrow has been targeted by terrorists before. Nine years ago, the Provisional IRA mortar bombed the airport but none of the devices exploded.
In the aftermath of the Manchester attacks in St Ann�셲 Square, I met Graham Foulkes. One of many experts offered up to a media desperately trying to offer some possible context, his intensity stood out. It was quickly apparent why: Graham Foulkes is an involuntary expert. His son, David, a bright young trainee for the Guardian Media Group, was killed at London�셲 Edgware Road station in the 7/7 attacks.
So whether Graham, a direct, thoughtful man, is being interviewed on live TV by Victoria Derbyshire or speaking into an anonymous radio mic, his focus in the immediate hours after an attack is reaching out to that person who �쐇s sat at home, knowing that their son is missing and that they can�셳 get in contact with him��. In many ways, he is reaching out to a version of himself on that terrible day in 2005.
Because while Graham acknowledges that the emergency response to a large-scale attack is now co-ordinated in a way that it wasn�셳 when his son was killed, there still exists an incredible, inhumane gap in services for the families of victims. Unlike homicide or missing-person cases, where police make contact with families as soon as they have found a body, the aftermath of terrorism is different. As minutes turn to hours, there is no support package and nobody to help prepare the family for what is to come.
While all of us express grief and sorrow and post messages of support to people we have never met, those families enter �쐌eltdown��, as Graham calls it. Carrying ID is commonplace now and police may know the identify of victims quickly. However, they are unable to knock at the door before the coroner has confirmed the identify of the victim and authorised the police to make contact. Only then are support services such as family liaison triggered.
Since the review of process that followed the Marchioness disaster, coroners will not release the bodies until they have absolute proof of identity. When David Foulkes was murdered on 7/7, this took a week. His father now dedicates his professional life (and much, you suspect, of his personal) to making sure that nobody else has to endure that gap, the time �쐗hen the most damage is done to the family��. He runs the Survivors Assistance Network (SAN), the smallest arm of the Warrington-based Foundation 4 Peace, (set up by Colin and Wendy Parry when their son, Tim, was killed in an IRA attack), for which Foulkes also assists on a terrorist deradicalisation programme (foundation4peace.org).
Graham describes a pragmatic battle for survival in those first few hours, broadening to a bewildering swamp of administration over time. Who on earth can predict how they would respond? Graham finds families obsessively trying to get information from the news channels (as he did) but they don�셳 tell us how to deal with the coroner�셲 office, or the police. �쏽ou have to remind people to drink, eat, have a wash and a bath as well,�� he says. �쏧t�셲 a hand-holding exercise.�� Partners without wills, their lives ended in an instant, leave families grappling with mortgages and bills for years to come.
SAN is currently helping more than 500 people, victims of terror and their families. �쏧f you lose a limb or an eye, you don�셳 get a family liaison officer either,�� notes Foulkes. �쏷hey come to us too.��
SAN runs these vital services on a budget �쐗ell under 짙200,000��, which I find shameful. And from that, one could subtract a big chunk of cash that must now be diverted into jumping through administrative hoops. Tiny charities such as SAN have seen their meagre budgets slashed as part of governance and process reforms to charities, the government�셲 response to the Camila Batmanghelidjh Kids Company mess.
In SAN�셲 case, this is precious money diverted from frontline services dealing with the aftermath of an attack, something nobody wants to think about, so apparently few people do. These include policymakers and those in a position to help Graham Foulkes plug that gap.
The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, vowed to boost his countries' anti-terrorist forces amid fears that there could be more militants hiding out in Mumbai planning further attacks in the city.
His pledge came after India's minister for state for home affairs, Sriprakash Jaiswal, said intelligence and state security was being increased to "a war level".
"The anti-terrorist forces of the country will be further strengthened and streamlined," said Singh in a statement today.
Two of the men responsible for India's internal security submitted their resignations today as the fallout from the deadly attacks in the city last week continued.
There has been anger that, despite previous terrorist atrocities in Mumbai and elsewhere in India in recent years, the authorities were unable to anticipate and prevent Thursday's events.
The death toll from the attacks has been revised down to 174 from 195 because of double counting of dead bodies. But officials have warned that it is likely to rise as the search of the Taj Mahal hotel continues.
India's minister for state for home affairs said today that India was increasing security in the country and on its borders.
"Our intelligence will be increased to a war level, we are asking the state governments to increase security to a war level," Sriprakash Jaiswal told Reuters in an interview.
Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated, with Indian officials saying today they have proof of a Pakistani link to the attacks. Islamabad said it would move troops to the Indian border if tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals spilled over.
Indian officials said the sole surviving gunman, now in custody, was from Pakistan but Islamabad has denied any links with state agencies.
"They can say what they want, but we have no doubt that the terrorists had come from Pakistan," said Jaiswal.
The British home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said today it was important that relations between India and Pakistan were "maintained and �� carried forward on a calm basis".
Although claims that British citizens were involved have been retracted, according to Smith, she said the government was reviewing the attacks for useful pointers to its own counter-terrorism strategy.
"Of course we do need to look in terms of our own work on terrorism at whether or not and what lessons need to be learned, we need to revise the very important work that we do on protecting our crowded places, our country as a whole from terrorism to bear in mind any lessons that we learn from this and we will do that," she told BBC 1's Andrew Marr show.
But the home secretary said her "first priority" was to support the Indian authorities and British citizens who had been caught up in the attacks.
A second suspected active terrorist plot has been foiled in London after armed police raided a house in the north-west of the capital, shooting one of the female suspects, hours after an unconnected incident in Westminster.
A woman in her 20s was shot and injured by counter-terror officers in the raid, which started just after 7pm on Thursday with CS gas being fired into the Willesden property. Witnesses said the injured woman, who was wearing a long dress and hijab, shouted at paramedics not to touch her body as she was treated at the scene.
The raid was carried out by elite counter-terrorism specialist firearms officers (CTSFO) and is believed to have been the first time the unit has opened fire during an operation. Six people, including a 16-year-old boy, have been arrested and properties continued to be searched in London and Kent on Friday.
Scotland Yard said the Willesden house had been �쐕nder observation by counter-terrorism officers as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation�� but added that the incident was not connected to the suspected attempted terrorist attack in Westminster earlier in the day.
One of those arrested is believed to be Mohamed Amoudi, 21, a British citizen of Yemeni origin who was deported from Turkey in 2015 and then questioned on his return to UK but released without any further action.
Alexandra Sabanov, 28, who lives next door to the property, said the couple who lived in the raided top-floor flat were Asian Muslims who often visited a nearby mosque. �쏧 think they were around my age. They spoke English �� It was English just like us, with a British accent; London, like us,�� she said.
She was one of several neighbours who said they had seen unusual activity on the road in the days before the raid, including several Vauxhall Corsas containing groups of white men who they speculated were police officers.
Ruth Haile, another neighbour, said that when the arrested woman came out of the house she had a bandage on her left side and was given first aid. �쏶he shouted: �쁃on�셳 touch me! Don�셳 touch me!�� They cut all her dress,�� she said. �쏧t was a black dress with a hijab.��
Maxine McKenzie, 48, a marketing director who lives on the street, said: �쏧 heard gunshots, because they are unmistakable when you hear them. I looked outside and there were lots of police, some plainclothes, some uniformed, obviously firearms officers. I saw them arrest somebody and they walked her down the road to here and handcuffed her and took her away.��
Sabanov added she had heard a woman �쐓creaming really loud�� shortly after the armed police arrived. �쏻e were just about to go shopping until we heard bang, bang, bang, bang, went to the window, and saw a number of armed police just there with their guns pointing at our nextdoor neighbour�셲 window.
�쏷hey were in the garden �� they were everywhere. They swarmed the whole house practically. I wasn�셳 even allowed in my garden; they were telling me: ��[There�셲] armed police, go inside.�쇺��
The woman was in a serious but stable condition and was under a police guard at a London hospital, police said. She had not been arrested due to her condition. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) started an investigation into the shooting, in line with protocol. Investigators are believed to have initial accounts from officers involved in the raid and will get full statements in the next 48 hours.
In Harlesden Road, a 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old woman were held at the targeted property and a 20-year-old man was detained nearby on Thursday evening. A 43-year-old woman was arrested in Kent and properties continued to be searched. All four were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
�쏷wo further arrests were made when a man and a woman, both aged 28, returned to the address late at night,�� Basu said.
CTSFOs are trained and equipped to the standards of special forces units such as the SAS. Their firearms include SIG516 semi-automatic weapons and they regularly train alongside armed forces. They are trained in forcing entry into buildings under dangerous circumstances.
Detectives are piecing together the history of the Westminster terrorist Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old ex-convict who used a string of aliases and reportedly converted to Islam only in later life.
Masood was described by police as a criminal with a 20-year record of offending, who had once been investigated for extremism but was assessed as low risk. Reports have emerged that his birthname was Adrian Russell Ajao. He was earlier named as Adrian Elms.
As police search for any evidence of a wider conspiracy, eight people remain in custody after properties across the UK were raided, while a picture emerged of the killer�셲 apparently nomadic lifestyle.
The death toll from his assault on the capital rose to four on Thursday night when a 75-year-old man, named as Leslie Rhodes from Streatham, south London, had his life support withdrawn at King�셲 College hospital.
The police said on Friday morning that two people remained in hospital in critical condition, with one of these considered to have �쐋ife-threatening�� injuries, after Masood drove his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before running into the parliamentary estate armed with two knives and fatally stabbing PC Keith Palmer before himself being shot dead. Fifty people have been confirmed as injured, with 31 requiring hospital treatment. Two police officers remained in hospital with significant injuries.
On Thursday night, thousands of people gathered to commemorate the victims of the attack in Westminster, and to hear speeches by the capital�셲 mayor and other leaders aimed at preventing terrorism from spreading division and hatred.
The vigil in Trafalgar Square, central London, was held to honour the dead and injured, Sadiq Khan said, but also �쐔o send a clear, clear, message �� Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism��.
Earlier, prime minister Theresa May told MPs Masood had been previously known to MI5: �쏶ome years ago, he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic �� he was not part of the current intelligence picture.��
Amber Rudd, the home secretary, later added that Masood had spent time in jail, but not for terrorist offences, while the Metropolitan police said �쏮asood�� was in all likelihood not his birth name.
The names of two people who died after Masood mowed them down on Westminster Bridge also emerged.
They were Kurt Cochran, 54, a US tourist from Utah celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary, and British-born Aysha Frade, 43, who worked at sixth-form college and had been walking over the bridge to pick up her daughters from school.
In the frenzied attack on Wednesday, Masood also stabbed to death PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father.
The prime minister said Palmer was �쐃very inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten��, while a crowdfunding appeal for his family has raised more than 짙364,000.
The attack was stopped when armed officers assigned to protect the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, shot Masood, who is believed to have been intent on entering parliament. Palmer died at New Palace Yard on the edge of the parliamentary estate, near Parliament Square, raising questions about security for legislators.
The original incident, in which Masood drove a Hyundai Tucson 4x4 into crowds at one of London�셲 busiest tourist spots, left 40 people injured, 29 of whom were taken to hospital.
In an emergency statement to the Commons, May said people from around the world had been caught up in the attack. �쏧n addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks,�� she said.
She also sounded a note of defiance, telling MPs: �쏷oday we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism.��
May�셲 spokesman said she had received phone calls from world leaders including Angela Merkel, Fran챌ois Hollande and Donald Trump, offering their condolences and support, and had herself signed a book of condolence in parliament. She later visited the injured in hospital.
Police said Masood had been inspired by Islamic State. But he hid his extremism from his neighbours, coming across as a keen gardener and family man.
The domestic intelligence service will face questions over why Masood dropped off the radar after being investigated in relation to concerns over violent extremism.
An MI5 team has been set up to see what lessons can be learned from the case and to look at the decision to not put him under surveillance. The police and security services monitor an estimated 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, regarded as capable of terrorism, but it emerged he was not on this list.
Isis claimed responsibilty for the attack, although the claim could not be verified. Amaq, the news agency it uses to broadcast propaganda, issued a statement describing the attacker as a soldier of Islamic State, without naming him.
Police revealed that Masood, born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964, had a string of criminal convictions. In a statement, the Met said: �쏦e was known to police and has a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.
�쏦is first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife.��
The investigation is being led by SO15, Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command. Police staged raids across Birmingham, including Masood�셲 recent home in Winson Green, and at properties in London, Carmarthenshire and Brighton.
Neighbour Iwona Romek said Masood was a keen gardener, who lived in the modern mews house with his wife and young child. Romek, 45, said her experience of him was of a �쐍ice man��.
She said the family had moved out suddenly in December 2016 and added: �쏧 used to see him outside doing his garden. Never any trouble.��
It is believed that Masood rented the Hyundai car that he turned into a weapon of terror from the depot of a car hire firm, Enterprise, in Spring Hill, Birmingham.
Police still believe the attack was carried out by Masood alone, but are looking into whether others helped him. The eight arrests were all on suspicion of acts of preparation of a terrorist act, a key indication that police are investigating the possibility of a wider conspiracy.
A 39-year-old woman was arrested in east London, while two women aged 26 and 21 were detained in Birmingham. Five men aged 23, 26, 27, 28 and 58 were arrested in Birmingham.
PC Palmer�셲 family released a statement paying tribute to the police officer, who had a five-year-old daughter. They said: �쏡edicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. We love him so much.��
As a mark of respect, Palmer�셲 shoulder number �� 4157U �� is to be retired and not reissued to any other officer, Scotland Yard said.
The Met has put extra officers on the streets and has extended the shifts they work from eight to 12 hours, until further notice. Forces outside London are also increasing their presence on the streets, to provide reassurance and to deter not only any further Islamist attacks but hate crimes against Muslims.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission began an investigation into the shooting of the suspect, which is mandated by law.
Samina Malik became the first woman convicted under new terrorism legislation after writing poems entitled How To Behead and The Living Martyrs.
Malik, described as an "unlikely but committed" Islamic extremist, was last month convicted by an jury at the Old Bailey of a charge under the 2000 Terrorism Act.
She worked at WH Smith at Heathrow, where she scribbled her extremist lyrics on till receipts. On one she wrote: "The desire within me increases every day to go for martyrdom."
But Malik told the jury she only adopted her "lyrical terrorist" nickname because she thought it was "cool" and insisted: "I am not a terrorist."
Malik had tears in her eyes as she left the dock, while her mother wept during the court hearing. The judge said Malik's crime was on the "margins" of the offence of which she was found guilty. He said Malik was of "good character" and from a "supportive and law-abiding family who are appalled by the trouble that you are in".
"The Terrorism Act and the restrictions it imposes on the personal freedom exist to protect this country, its interests here and abroad, its citizens, and those who visit here. Its protection embraces us all. Its restrictions apply to us all, whatever our personal religious or political beliefs."
He told Malik that if she had been convicted of the more serious charge of possessing an article for terrorist purposes - of which the jury cleared her - she would have faced a jail term. But he said, while a custodial sentence was merited, she had already faced "extremely rigorous" bail conditions which were "tantamount to house arrest".
The court heard that she also spent five months in custody after being arrested in October last year. Malik's sentence was suspended for 18 months, with the condition that she be supervised for the whole period and undertake unpaid work.
Outside court Malik's solicitor Iqbal Ahmed read out a statement on her behalf. He said: "The trial process has been a terrible ordeal for her and she is now relieved that it is all over. The jury found that she did not have the material for terrorist purposes which was an important part of her case. She now wants to get on with her life."
Last month, Malik was found guilty of possessing records likely to be useful in terrorism by a majority of 10 to one. She cried as the verdict was read. Two female jurors were also in tears. The court heard that Malik stocked a "library" of material useful to terrorists at her family home in Southall, west London.
The court was told Malik was 20 years old when she "first started to consider Islam" and was "like most teenagers, somewhat rebellious". Malik had been interested in poetry, and had written love poems, followed by rap poems and later by "what can only be described as the distasteful poetry which has been mentioned in this trial".
John Burton, defending, said: "She became hooked on Abu Hamza-type addresses and that affected her mindset." The jury was told that she joined an extremist organisation called Jihad Way, set up explicitly to spread terrorist propaganda and support for al Qaida.
Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, told the court she visited a website linked to the jailed cleric Abu Hamza and stored material about weapons. The court also heard Malik belonged to a social networking website called hi5, describing her interests as "helping the mujaheddin in any way which I can".
Under favourite TV shows, she listed: "Watching videos by my Muslim brothers in Iraq, yep the beheading ones, watching video messages by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri and other videos which show massacres of the kaffirs." removed
After her conviction, Judge Peter Beaumont, the recorder of London, told her: "You have been, in many respects, a complete enigma to me."
A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the decision by the judge to suspend the sentence. Inayat Bunglawala said: "It always seemed a rather bizarre decision to prosecute Samina when she is clearly not an actual terror plotter.
"Samina Malik was being prosecuted in effect for a thought crime because she had downloaded some material from the internet which anyone could download." Mr Bunglawala said the case demonstrated how ill-conceived and "incredibly broad-ranging" the law is under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act. "Teenagers download some quite nihilistic material every day and they are not prosecuted," he said.
"The fact that this case went to court sends a very worrying signal that if you are Muslim and you are downloading from the Internet you may be judged to a quite different standard from others. Fortunately the judge has been sensible about this. The wider Muslim community must be relieved that she hasn't got a custodial sentence."
In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Samina Malik was not prosecuted for writing poetry. Ms Malik was convicted of collecting information, without reasonable excuse, of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism."
The Guardian publishes for the first time today the details of more than 200 flights in and out of Britain of aircraft owned or controlled by the CIA. The agency has used almost 20 airports across the UK during the period when its agents have been snatching terror suspects and taking them to countries where they may be tortured. As well as enjoying access to a number of RAF bases, the agency has been flying in and out of civilian airports across the country. Its destinations include not only major airports such as Heathrow and Gatwick, but small airports at Bournemouth on the south coast and Wick in the north of Scotland.
Last night MPs, who have formed a campaign group to challenge British support for the CIA's so-called extraordinary renditions programme, met for the first time and demanded that the government come clean about the use of UK facilities. The all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary renditions was presented with a report by American legal academics which suggested that Britain may be breaking international law by "acquiescing" in torture.
The CIA has been moving detainees around the world to a number of secret prisons, using aircraft owned by front companies or leased for short periods. Ms Rice said yesterday that "renditions take terrorists out of action and save lives".
Using publicly-available information from the US federal aviation administration, as well as European air traffic data, the Guardian has compiled a detailed log of the CIA's flights in and out of the UK during the period that the rendition programme has been operating.
There have been more than 210 flights in and out of the country since the attacks of September 11. One Gulfstream V executive jet, for example, which has changed its tail number several times and has been linked with a number of abductions, is a regular visitor to Glasgow airport, and also flies in and out of Luton, Northolt and Brize Norton.
Some aircraft have stopped in the UK for short refuelling stops, but at other times they have remained in the country for several days. But there is no evidence that any detainees have been on board aircraft when they have stopped in the UK and many of the flights are thought to be unconnected with renditions.
Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, responded to Ms Rice by saying that "all European countries fully share the determination expressed here by the US to protect our citizens from the threat of terrorism, clearly while operating within international law and our treaty obligations". Such was the threat of suicide attacks after September 11 and July 7, he said, that "it is right that democracies should discuss these issues, including the importance of the legal framework, which we all observe. Secretary Rice's reply makes clear that US policy is to comply with the UN convention against torture."
The Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the parliamentary committee, questioned the value of the assurances sought from countries where suspected terrorists were sent that they would not be tortured."We have to ask ourselves how valuable assurances of that type are from countries such as Egypt, Syria and Libya," he said." I think it is highly likely that some of these people will have been tortured."
He said the committee would ask Mr Straw to give evidence to it, adding that the MPs were "not prepared to put up with vacuous replies".
Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, described Ms Rice's admission as disingenuous. "What possible purpose is served by rendition other than to subject individuals to harsher treatment than would otherwise be the case?" he asked.
Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, said any suggestion from Ms Rice that the ends justified the means "would give dangerous ammunition to every dictator and terrorist around the world".
India handed to 짯Islamabad today a dossier of evidence of Pakistani "links" to the gunmen who led a bloody rampage through Mumbai in November that left more than 170 dead, in an attempt to mobilise world opinion against its neighbour.
New Delhi's foreign affairs ministry said the terrorists who attacked Mumbai were linked to "elements" in Pakistan, a charge Islamabad has said is without proof.
The evidence handed to the Pakistani high commissioner in New Delhi rests largely on the interrogation of the lone surviving gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman �� also known as Mohammed Ajmal Kasab �� who hails from the Pakistani Punjab.
He has reportedly told authorities that he and nine other gunmen were Pakistani, that he was trained in Pakistan and that the people behind the attack are still there.
Pakistan has said it has no record of Kasab as a Pakistani citizen.
Other evidence included: conversations between the alleged handlers in Pakistan and the gunmen during the attack; recovered weapons; and data retrieved from global positioning system data and satellite phones. Islamabad says there is no proof the attacks were launched from across the border.
New Delhi blamed the three-day November assault on the banned Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which it says trained and equipped the 10 militants. The gunmen chose high-profile targets such as two five-star hotels, the main railway station, restaurants popular with foreign tourists and a Jewish centre.
"This material is linked to elements in Pakistan," a statement from the Indian foreign ministry said. "It is our expectation that the government of Pakistan will promptly undertake further investigations in Pakistan and share the results with us so as to bring the perpetrators to justice."
Pakistan's foreign ministry declined to comment while it reviewed the evidence. The Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said Islamabad would not hand over any Pakistani nationals to India, noting that the two sides did not have an extradition treaty.
"But the problem is still there. After all an incident has taken place and we have to get to the bottom of it," Qureshi said.
At the weekend, the Indian home minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, said the Mumbai attack could only have come from "state or state-assisted actors", hinting at a role by Pakistan's controversial military spy agency, the ISI.
In his first interview after the attack, Chidambaram said: "Somebody who is familiar with intelligence and who is familiar with commando operations has directed this operation. And that cannot be a non-state actor."
The new moves are part of an Indian diplomatic offensive to maintain international pressure on Pakistan, and coincides with the arrival in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, of Richard Boucher, the top US diplomat for South Asia, who is expected to have tough words with the government of President Asif Ali Zardari.
Boucher's trip comes a few days before the US vice-president-elect, Joe Biden, lands in Islamabad with a congressional committee intent on securing the incoming Obama administration's role in the war on terror.
Pakistan redeployed some troops on its Indian border in December �� away from its border with Afghanistan �� in effect reducing efforts to gain control of the lawless tribal region that is a hotbed of al-Qaida activity. Pakistan also closed off the Khyber Pass, a key supply route for western troops in Afghanistan, saying it was launching search-and-destroy missions on the Pakistani border.
On Monday, police found three bullet-riddled bodies in the North Waziristan tribal region and said they were victims of the Taliban. One was a Pakistani construction contractor and two others were Afghan men that the Taliban accused of spying for the US, said local police.
"I don't think Pakistan needs added pressure from India," said Shaukat Qadir, a retired Pakistani brigadier general turned analyst. "We are already under pressure and facing terrorism."
In her comments in the aftermath of last weekend�셲 attacks in London, Theresa May suggested a new direction in the struggle against terrorism. Insisting that �쐔hings need to change��, she pointed to the problems of �쐓egregated, separated communities�� and �쐔oo much tolerance of Islamist extremism��.
It is not clear from her comments exactly what sorts of changes are implied or to be expected, beyond greater control of the internet and increased jail sentences for terrorism-related crimes. But her comments clearly emphasised the need to defeat what she called �쐔he single evil ideology of Islamist extremism��.
In fact, experts are divided on the wisdom and effectiveness of tackling ideology and beliefs within religious communities. Some argue that ideology is the most critical point in the war on terror, no matter how challenging it might be to win hearts and minds. Others counter that focusing so heavily on religious beliefs and practices within Muslim communities carries numerous risks. For example, it encourages the false assumption that Islamic practices and ways of life directly correlate with violence. Common religious acts such as praying every day, growing a beard and fasting in Ramadan start to seem alarming and �쐒adical��. All religious Muslims, in other words, become suspect.
I have seen this happen first-hand among Salafi communities in France, where prominent politicians have called for �쏿 cultural struggle against Salafism��. Salafis are a minority of the world�셲 Muslims, tremendously diverse and mostly uninvolved in politics, let alone political violence. Yet states are branding them �쐒adical Muslims�� in part because of their generally strict practices, but also because some terrorists in Europe hid themselves in Salafi communities.
In my research as a sociologist of religion, I spent time immersed in a Salafi mosque community in south-east France. The neighbourhood was segregated, with an unemployment rate of 40% among young adults. Salafi men and women there appear to be �쐓elf-segregated��. But their separation from the wider community was not necessarily their choice. They suffered hostility in public spaces and severe job discrimination, based on where they lived, their Muslim names and religious dress. Research on Muslims in Britain shows the same trends.
Over the years I watched Salafi women, in particular, grow increasingly isolated as the state passed anti-veiling legislation, expanded surveillance and initiated debates about national loyalty that stigmatised Muslims. Some young women I knew withdrew from school after the state banned the headscarf from public schools in 2004.
Others I knew feared for their safety when strangers harassed them, and had trouble envisioning a positive future for themselves in France. Their faith and ethical teachings provided an important refuge for them. For some Salafi men, a rigorous spiritual path focused on God, and everyday religious requirements was an alternative to drugs and prison. Mounir, for example, a young man who worked as a janitor in his public housing complex, was sad that he had lost most of his friends to prison. After prison, he said, they saw a second chance and �쐗ant[ed] to come back to God��.
The danger of emphasising ideology in counter-terror strategies is that it dismisses this entire social context, detracting attention from other vital concerns such as the burgeoning prison system and socioeconomic exclusion, and makes everyone suspect based on their religious practice. In fact, strict religiosity may have little to do with terrorism. As researchers have pointed out, most of the attackers in Europe and the US turned to terrorism after years of criminal behaviour, delinquency or domestic violence. Despite their use of Islamic metaphors and practices, they were far from pious. Olivier Roy, a French expert on political Islam, has called this an �쏧slamisation of radicalism and not the radicalisation of Islam.��
This is not to deny that charismatic Muslim leaders and social networks have played a role in inciting violence as seen throughout Europe. And the Muslim Council of Britain concurred with the sentiment behind May�셲 comments that �쐃nough is enough��.
But if the struggle is ultimately about ideology, we cannot afford to take a simplistic and unproductive view of it as �쐒adical Islam�� versus �쏝ritish values��. Individuals vulnerable to terrorist recruitment crave meaning and belonging. Perhaps this is why some appear drawn to the convictions and moral structure in Salafi traditions and communities. If we want to grasp the long and tangled roots of �쐔he single evil ideology��, we need to find the courage to collectively struggle for economic and political inclusion. Until this happens, it is not clear what exactly will change.
As Irish republicans fighting the British army in the 1970s were quick to realise - one bomb in London was worth far more in terms of its impact and publicity than a dozen in Northern Ireland.
On mainland Britain, interest in events in Belfast and Londonderry quickly faded, but the Provisional IRA took their fight to the UK capital in an effort to shake the resolve of the public and put pressure on the government.
London was not only a potent symbol with the national media, on hand to record any devastation, but it housed a large Irish community in which IRA active service units were able to move easily.
The public outrage caused by bombing atrocities contributed to grave miscarriages of justice - the Birmingham six and the Guildford four - which were in a sense another IRA "success" in humiliating the British state.
The parallels with groups like al-Qaida, which can move within London's large Muslim communities, are obvious, and figures like London mayor Ken Livingstone today tried to stress the need for Londoners to stand together rather than turn on innocent Muslims.
Almost equally disturbing for a short time were the two nail bombs targeted at the black and Asian communities of Brixton and Brick Lane in April 1999, followed by an attack on a gay pub, the Admiral Duncan, in Soho. These were revealed to be the work of a lone hate-filled individual, David Copeland.
The IRA bomb campaign, which hit London from 1973 onwards, sought to create a climate of fear over a long period, but it soon tried to explode two or more devices at a time to maximise the havoc. There were 36 bombs in London in 1973.
Over 20 years, the IRA strategy shifted away from causing as many casualties as possible to trying to cause economic damage to London's financial centre.
1973, March 8: two IRA car bombs in London explode outside the Old Bailey and government's agriculture department headquarters, killing one person and wounding more than 150
1974, October 5: two IRA bombs explode in pubs in the London suburb of Guildford; five dead, more than 50 injured
November 21: two IRA bombs in Birmingham kill 19 and wound more than 180
1982, July 20: two IRA bombs in Hyde Park and Regent's Park in London kill 11 British soldiers and wound more than 40, mostly civilian onlookers
1983, December 17: IRA car bomb explodes outside Harrods department store, killing six people and wounding about 100
1984 October 12: IRA targets conference of ruling Conservative party, killing five and wounding 24, but narrowly missing the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher
1989, September 22: the IRA bombs the Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, killing 10 soldiers and wounding more than 30
1991, February 7: IRA fires three homemade mortar shells at No 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister's official residence in London. No injuries
1992, April 10: a massive IRA truck bomb in London's financial district kills three and causes hundreds of millions of pounds worth in damage
April 24: an IRA truck bomb in London's financial district, killing one and causing heavy damage
1996, February 9: IRA ends a 17-month ceasefire with a third massive truck bomb in London's financial district, killing two
February 18: an IRA bomber accidentally kills himself aboard a London double-decker bus, five injured
June 15: for the first time, the IRA targets a different English city - Manchester - with a massive truck bomb, wrecking the central shopping area and wounding about 200
2000, September 20: IRA dissidents fire rocket-propelled grenades at headquarters of MI6 security agency. No injuries.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated last night after it was claimed that the only terrorist to have survived three days of deadly battles in Mumbai was from Pakistan, and that his nine fellow Islamist militants were either from that country or had been trained there.
The claims about responsibility for the attack, in which almost 200 people were killed, came from leaked police accounts that gave details of the interrogation of Azam Amir Kasab, 21, said to have been the man pictured at Mumbai's main train station carrying an assault rifle and grenades.
According to the reports, which could not be independently verified, Kasab said that the operation was the responsibility of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a jihadist group based in Pakistan, and its aim was to 'kill as many as possible' in what was intended to be India's 9/11. The claims were made as Indian special forces ended the violent sieges around Mumbai with the killing of the final three terrorists holding out in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel - where British survivors had walked through rooms strewn with bodies and 'blood and guts' as they were led to safety.
The allegations about Pakistan emerged as India was confronted with the full horror of the past few days. Reporters were allowed into the wrecked and scorched remains of the Taj Mahal and Trident-Oberoi hotels, where scores of victims had been murdered.
Public anger in India has been mounting following allegations linking Pakistan to the attacks. They include:
�� Kasab's claim that militants were trained in two camps run by Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan.
�� Allegations that phones found on a trawler suspected of ferrying the gunmen to Mumbai had been used to contact Pakistan.
�� The claim by India's minister of state for home affairs, Sri Prakash Jaiswal, that 'the investigation carried out so far has revealed the hand of Pakistan-based groups in the Mumbai attack'.
In response to the claim that the attackers were either Pakistanis or had been trained there, a senior Pakistani official said troops would be sent to the border if tensions continued to rise.
However, despite initial claims, it became increasingly certain that there was no involvement of British-based fundamentalists. Police forces across the UK denied they were investigating named individuals and Gordon Brown said there was no evidence linking any of the terrorist to the UK.
The escalating war of words between India and Pakistan has set alarm bells ringing in the United States, where President Bush convened an emergency meeting with senior security officials. President-elect Barack Obama, who has said that reconciliation between the nuclear-armed neighbours is essential to stabilise Afghanistan and defeat al-Qaeda, called Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday night to offer condolences.
The cold-blooded intent of the militants has shaken India. Officials said just 10 gunmen, with enough arms and ammunition 'to kill 5,000 people', had attacked the Taj, the Trident-Oberoi, the main railway station, a popular restaurant and a cinema. In the siege of a Jewish centre, which was retaken by security forces on Friday night, the militants had bound and shot five people, including a rabbi and his wife, before they were killed.
A handful of gunmen held out for almost three days, taking hundreds of people hostage, many of them Westerners. Twenty-two of those killed were foreigners. Last night emergency services raised the prospect that many - including three Britons - were still missing from the Taj.
The gunmen set the 105-year-old hotel ablaze as they evaded scores of India's best-trained commandos. They left bodies with grenades stuffed into their mouths.
The photograph of a baby-faced militant, whom newspaper reports claim is Kasab, wearing combat trousers and swinging an AK47 in Mumbai's main railway station, is the defining image of the rampage. His victims are said to include Mumbai's anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare, whose body was cremated yesterday.
Under questioning, Kasab is said to have admitted to being a resident of Faridkot in Pakistan's Punjab province. 'I was trained by Lashkar-e-Taiba and asked to cause maximum casualties in Mumbai,' he is alleged to have said, referring to an organisation which India says is sending armed militants into Kashmir. Kasab was arrested on Wednesday night after his partner, said to be Ismail Khan, was shot dead.
The duo's night began when they fired on commuters in the railway station and in two hospitals. Kasab told police that they had learnt about Mumbai's geography using Google Earth.
According to Indian media reports, the captured militant said that a room booked in the Taj had been used to store explosives and ammunition ahead of the attacks. This might explain how the squads of gunmen were able to reload their weapons over more than 50 hours and appeared to have an inexhaustible supply of grenades.
Asif Ali Zardari, the President of Pakistan, yesterday appeared on Indian television in an attempt to defuse tensions. 'As President of Pakistan, if any evidence comes of any individual or group in any part of my country, I shall take the swiftest action in the light of evidence and in front of the world,' he said.
Analysts said that the omens did not look good for the peace process between India and Pakistan. 'I expect a very difficult time ahead,' said Tariq Fatemi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. 'Anything short of a real and genuine effort to co-operate by Pakistan would send very, very bad signals - not just to India but to the US and to Europe too.'
It was only ever a matter of time. This strike at parliament took aim directly at the heart of British democracy. It was perhaps meant to reach the prime minister �� for today, the day of prime minister�셲 questions, was the one day when her movements would be well known �� but more probably it was, like the attack in Berlin just before Christmas, simply an attempt to hit at a European centre of power. The earlier car attack on the혻dozens of tourists and office workers and three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony, caught walking across Westminster Bridge around 2.45pm, was plainly intended to magnify the terror.
This is the moment that everyone planned for and hoped would never happen, the Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, said at his first news conference afterwards. It was also the hardest kind of attack to stop, an apparently lone terrorist using low-tech weaponry seeking to do maximum harm, almost certain of death himself. He got through, but혻a dozen or more attacks have been foiled in Britain since 2013, 10 of them in the past two years. More than 500 live counter-terror investigations are under way at any given moment, Mr Rowley said recently. The police and the security forces have to be right all the time. The terrorists only need to be lucky once. It is important to hold on to that truth, and to remember that, terrible as the loss of life has been and grim as the aftermath will be, no one would want to live in the kind of world where such an attack had been made entirely impossible.
The security forces acted swiftly and courageously to protect parliament and the public. For the families of the dead, and for the injured, this is a horrendous, life-changing event. The shock and distress of eyewitnesses, trapped on buses or simply walking along the pavement, was evident in their voices and their faces as they spoke to reporters. Some of them behaved with impressive presence of mind, including the foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood, who tried to revive the fatally injured policeman.
The security forces and police have planned for what they call a �쐌arauding attack�� for years. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace.
There will be many questions to ask in the혻coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did혻their job.
What now? We often mock our political class, but it is worth remembering that being an MP has never been risk-free. In혻1979, the IRA murdered the senior Tory MP Airey Neave with a car bomb only yards from where today�셲 attack took place. An MP died in the Brighton bomb in 1984, and another was murdered at his home in 1990. Last June, Jo Cox died at the hands of a rightwing extremist, Thomas Mair, as she made her way to her constituency surgery. Security at parliament is tighter than it has ever been. Its one obvious weakness was the main vehicle entrance into New Palace Yard, off the road linking Whitehall with other government offices. This is the very heart of government. It�셲 where tourists stand taking selfies through the open gates of the place that is still regarded around the world as the birthplace of modern democracy.
Today�셲 attack has long been anticipated. It is not an act of war. It must not be allowed to divide us one from the other. Terror�셲 purpose is to spread hate and혻division. The first protection against it must be solidarity.
Terror Kid by Benjamin Zephaniah is an incredibly self-aware, eye-opening book. The story focuses on a teenage boy called Rico Federico, who has a passion for computers. The book takes place in London, where dozens of riots are occurring as a result of unfair treatment by police. Although his friends are running rampant through the streets, inspired by the theft and chaos, Rico wants no part in it. He wants to help, but believes that causing more trouble isn't going to help him. He is used to being an easy target for the police, having been arrested many times for no reason, so wants to protest, but in a peaceful manner.
Then Rico has an idea. What if he could use his skills with computers to send a message, without having to take to the streets? It is now that Rico meets Speech. Speech is a mysterious man, whom Rico knows barely anything about. Speech has an idea, too. He wants to work with Rico to shut down the police's website, for a mere ten minutes, just to get a point across. Rico agrees to help him�� a peaceful cyber protest right? How much harm could it do? More than expected apparently.
Rico finds himself on the run, accused of murder and terrorism. Throughout the book, Rico learns many valuable lessons about trust and honesty. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this work, because I think it sends a very strong, clear message, which is very important to a lot of today's youth. I also really love Zephaniah's style of writing, which is very frank, and to the point, which may sound a bit boring, yet actually reveals a lot about the character and the situation he is in. I have never read a book that ends quite like Terror Kid does. I won't give it away, but the ending inspires a bit of frustration, but a lot of wonder as well. It really makes the reader question their own perceptions of the circumstances, and indeed the entire story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in social rights issues, or just any teenager who is angry at "the system" and wants to see change in something they believe is important. It really makes you see things in a whole new light, and is a story you'll be thinking about for weeks after you've finished the last page.

Four men from the Midlands have been charged with planning terrorist acts after a major security operation saw the bomb squad called to examine suspect material in a central Birmingham property.
The men were arrested on 26 August in a series of raids in Birmingham and Stoke and counter-terrorism officials believe they may have disrupted a plot to attack Britain which was possibly imminent.
Each of the four charged men is accused of preparing terrorist acts between 26 May and 27 August 2016.
The charges were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday and come amid a heightened fear of an attack on the UK. Police said one man aged 18 who was arrested in Birmingham had been released without charge.
Also on Thursday, a separate inquiry unconnected to the Birmingham case resulted in London police arresting two men aged 19 and 20 allegedly involved in preparing an act of terrorism.
Those charged are two Birmingham men, Naweed Ali, 28, and Khobaib Hussain, 24, both of Evelyn Road, Sparkhill. The others �� Mohibur Rahman, 31, and Tahir Aziz, 37 �� are both from Stoke.
Police said the four men would appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday charged with preparing for terrorist acts, contrary to Section 5 (a) of the Terrorism Act 2006.
That section says �쏛 person commits an offence if, with the intention of �� committing acts of terrorism �� he engages in any conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention.��
The arrests in the Midlands led to the examination of premises in Lee Bank, Birmingham, involving the Army bomb disposal team from the Royal Logistic Corps, who used a robot device. Police said the searches concluded four days after they started.
In Thursday�셲 counter-terrorism operation, the two men were arrested at an address in west London as part of a joint operation by police and MI5.
Scotland Yard said a 19-year-old was detained on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism and a 20-year-old was held on suspicion of funding terrorism and failing to disclose information regarding a planned act of terrorism. The 20-year-old was also held on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism under a separate investigation by the south-east counter-terrorism unit. He was bailed to a date in early November pending further enquiries. The 19-year-old remains in custody.
A third man, 19, was detained in south-east London on suspicion of a religiously aggravated offence, which officials described as being �쐇n relation to a separate matter��. He has been bailed to a date in mid-October pending further enquires.
Police said searches of addresses and vehicles were being carried out in the Thames Valley as well as in west and south-east London.
The government has previously claimed that seven plots linked to Islamist terrorists have been foiled in Britain since 2014, directly linked by officials to the rise of Islamic State. Since August 2014, Britain has been at its second highest level of terror alert �� severe �� meaning an attack is highly likely.
Friday�셲 decision to raise the level of threat to Britain from terrorism was taken following an objective analysis of intelligence independent of ministers, government officials insist. The decision was taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (Jtac), which brings together security and intelligence officers whose task is to examine information relating to international terrorism supplied by MI6, MI5 and GCHQ.
For many months, MI5 and police counter-terrorist officers have been warning of the potential threat posed by Britons returning from Syria or Iraq. Of the estimated 500-plus Britons who have fought with rebel or Islamist groups there, more than half have returned, say security and intelligence sources. Some may have been tasked to attack targets in Britain, others �� described as �쐒adicalised self-starters�� �� may decide to commit terror attacks here. That, anyway, is the risk perceived by the members of Jtac.
We do not know, we will never know, why they decided to raise the terror threat level from �쐓ubstantial�� �� when an attack is considered �쏿 strong possibility�� �� to �쐓evere��, the second highest level and the point at which an attack is considered �쐆ighly likely��. The decision does not mean there is any intelligence suggesting an attack is �쐇mminent�� �� the criterion for the highest threat level, known as �쐁ritical��.
We have to take the judgment on trust. Intelligence, as both officials and ministers admit, is a kind of art form, a question of judgment, and thus �� to some extent at least �� subjective. This was a point that came across very strongly during the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry in the 1990s.
It is now judged that the risk has increased sufficiently to raise the official threat level. For Jtac it is always best, and in its professional interests, to play safe.
The rise in the threat level was announced with great fanfare by the home secretary, Theresa May, and was followed swiftly by an announcement by David Cameron that on Monday, the day parliament returns from its long summer break, the government plans to introduce new powers to strip terror suspects of their passports. The question that raises is what evidence the police and MI5 will need, or will it be possible to use the new powers on the basis of assumption and mere suspicion?
As former senior MI6 officers Sir Richard Dearlove and Richard Barrett have warned, it should not be assumed that those who return to Britain from Iraq and Syria all intend to commit acts of terrorism here. Moreover, while the new powers may target symptoms, the issue of what creates a jihadist mentality will need much deeper thoughts and actions.
The Taj Mahal hotel dominates the Mumbai waterfront in a manner appropriate to its status as the meeting place of the city's elite.
Built in 1903 at a cost of 짙250,000 (equivalent to 짙127m today), it was the first hotel in India to have an air-conditioned ballroom. It also had a Turkish bath.
Two years after it opened, the Prince of Wales stayed. Later guests included US presidents John F Kennedy and Bill Clinton, Prince Philip, Mick Jagger and The Beatles. George Harrison studied Indian music with Ravi Shankar in its rooms.
The hotel was built by the "father of Indian industry", Jamsetji Tata. The industrialist felt a high-class hotel was needed to enhance Bombay's reputation as one of the world's great cities. Legend has it his motivation also owed much to having been turned away from one of the city's finest hotels because he was Indian.
Considered a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic architecture �� combining the gothic with elements of Indian and Islamic architecture �� the Taj Mahal hotel has a central dome, cupolas, and a facade of white, grey and red brick. According to another legend, that the main entrance faces inland rather than out to sea because while the architect was away, the labourers got the plans back to front.
Its opulence is legendary. Vaulted alabaster ceilings, archways, onyx columns and a cantilever staircase vie for attention with hand-woven silk carpets, crystal chandeliers, antique furniture and an enviable art collection.
Despite arched balconies and a similar level of luxury, a wing added in 1970 perhaps inevitably failed to impress.
The Taj Mahal is still owned by the giant Tata group, which is based in Mumbai. It has 565 rooms, including 46 suites, and rooms to entertain up to 2,000 guests at a sitting. The cheapest room for two costs 19,000 rupees (짙250) a night.
A short walk from Bombay stock exchange, the state legislature and a handful of national banks, the five-star Trident Oberoi is a modern hotel orientated firmly towards the business market.
Located in Nariman point, Mumbai's central business district, its guests have included Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch, and Forbes Traveler magazine voted it among the best 400 hotels in the world.
The Trident Oberoi is becoming increasingly popular with guests from the Gulf, who, according to Arab business website AME Info, use the hotel as a base while having medical treatment or on visits to see the monsoon in full flow.
In terms of decor, the hotel has gone for an understated European look, although some rooms feature four-poster beds with barley twist posts. Alongside the 333 bedrooms and 22 suites is a hi-tech 24-hour business centre with conference facilities.
The hotel has an on-site golf course, swimming pool and spa, and Indian and Italian restaurants. But its principal selling point is a personal butler service for every room, with female butlers provided for Muslim families if requested.
The Trident Oberoi is one of 30 hotels and cruisers to be owned by the Oberoi Group across five countries.
The group was founded in 1934 by Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi, a hotelier who started in the industry as the desk clerk of the Cecil hotel �� which his group now owns. Working his way up, a few years later he mortgaged everything including his wife's jewellery to buy his first hotel. Oberoi later became the first Indian hotelier to go into business with large international chains and the first to employ women in his hotels. He died six years ago, aged 103.
The cafe opened in 1871 and is a popular place for tourists and foreigners. Casting agents sometimes hang out in its noisy and smoky environs looking for foreigners to work as extras on Bollywood films. It is also popular with the city's art crowd, attracting writers, poets and painters.
Formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, Chhatrapati Shivaji is a World Heritage site and the headquarters of the Central Railways of India. One of the busiest railway stations in the country, it was opened in 1888, fusing British and Indian architecture. It boasts a spectacular stone dome, turrets and pointed arches.
The five-storey residential building in south Mumbai contains the city headquarters of the ultra-orthodox Jewish outreach group Chabad Lubavitch. The group's main emissary, Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, and his family live in the building with other families. The house is an educational centre and a synagogue and offers drug counselling services. It attracts hundreds of Israeli and Jewish visitors.
Another popular destination for foreigners as it shows English-language as well as Bollywood films. It was built by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and opened in 1938. The art deco building initially showed only MGM films but was taken over by an Indian business in the 1970s and became a popular venue for Bollywood premieres. In 2006 it was reinvented as a six-screen multiplex, Metro Adlabs. It maintained its grandeur and was known for its specially designed seats.
The hospital is near the police headquarters. It was built in the late 1880s by a wealthy businessman belonging to India's Parsi community to provide medical treatment for women and the poor.
When, on Sunday evening, Belgian police asked citizens not to tweet about the armed operations that were being carried out around the country, anyone could have been excused for reacting with fear.
Belgian forces �� searching for suspects in the aftermath of the Paris attacks �� told citizens to stay indoors and not go near their windows for safety reasons.
They also appealed for social media silence about any police action users might witness �� presumably to keep the suspects in the dark.
A tense time, no doubt. But Belgium reacted �� how else? �� with cats.
Instead of speculation about the sort of threat police might be reacting to, many people used the #BrusselsLockdown hashtag to post pictures of their pets.
And after the all-clear was announced by officials �� with the news of arrests �� there was a sigh of relief and a message of gratitude.
Belgian police later thanked the cats for their help.
Dramatic footage has emerged of the suspected terrorist attack near the London barracks that left one man dead, showing a suspect with blood-covered hands using jihadist rhetoric to justify the violence.
On Wednesday night the prime minister, David Cameron, vowed that Britain will "never buckle" in the face of terrorist incidents, and condemned the "absolutely sickening" killing in Woolwich.
As the government's emergency committee Cobra convened in central London to assess the implications of the incident, ITV News broadcast footage of one of the alleged attackers.
Brandishing a cleaver and a knife, and with the body of the victim lying yards away, the man said: "We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you. The only reason we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
"We must fight them. I apologise that women had to witness this today.
"But in our land our women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove your government, they don't care about you."
The man then walks away and talks to another suspected attacker.
Later footage shows the aftermath after the two suspects were shot by police.
It is believed the person died after suffering knife injuries, possibly around the head area.
Two people have been taken to hospital after they were shot by armed police.
There were reports that the man who was fatally attacked was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt.
The Woolwich and Greenwich MP, Nick Raynsford, said it was his understanding that one person, a serving soldier, was dead but there was no immediate confirmation of this from the Ministry of Defence.
The prime minister said: "Tonight, our thoughts should be with the victim, with their family, with their friends."
"People across Britain, people in every community, I believe, will utterly condemn this attack.
"We have had these sorts of attacks before in our country and we never buckle in the face of them."
Cameron was speaking at a Paris press conference with French president Francois Hollande but confirmed he would cut short the visit to return to the UK tonight to chair a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee in the morning.
Chiefs at the Woolwich barracks were understood to be trying to account for military personnel, amid reports the dead person may have been connected to the military. The incident happened 300-400 metres from the perimeter of the barracks.
The barracks is home to the Princess of Wales regiment and the Kings Troop, which is a ceremonial unit, that relocated to Woolwich last year.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the shooting by police, which is standard in cases where officers open fire.
In a statement the IPCC said it had "been made aware by Metropolitan Police Service of an incident in Woolwich, south London. IPCC investigators have been deployed to the scene and to the post-incident process. The IPCC has declared this as an independent investigation."
Earlier Raynsford said: "The incident occurred early afternoon. One individual is dead, two others are seriously injured and in hospital.
"We think a serving soldier was the victim. We don't know the circumstances surrounding the incident.
"We do know a number of weapons have been seized. They include a gun, various knives, and a machete, apparently."
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have sanctioned a dozen organisations and 59 people it accuses of links to Islamist militancy �� a number of them Qataris or with links to Qatar �� escalating the diplomatic crisis in the region.
The publication of the sanctions list comes amid increasing efforts by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain to diplomatically and physically isolate the tiny but wealthy Gulf state of Qatar, which has been subjected to a series of co-ordinated measures in the past five days.
The move was announced as Turkey�셲 president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an, approved new legislation �� rushed through the Turkish parliament the day before �� for increased military cooperation with Qatar, including the potential deployment of Turkish troops.
Turkey�셲 Hurriyet newspaper reported that the initial deployment would be a military assessment team arriving in the coming days to consider reinforcing a 90-strong mission already based in Doha.
On Friday, Qatar�셲 foreign minister described the blockade as a violation of international law and said there was an attempt to mobilise international opinion against the Gulf emirate.
�쏷hese procedures that were taken have clear violations of international law and international humanitarian law. They will not have a positive impact on the region but a negative one,�� Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a joint news conference with his German counterpart during a visit to Germany.
The previous day al-Thani gave a defiant interview with al-Jazeera, repeatedly denying that his country funded extremists and vowing not to back down in the face of the Saudi-led campaign.
�쏻e are not ready to surrender, and we will never be ready to surrender the independence of our foreign policy,�� he said, adding that Qatar�셲 residents need not fear food shortages.
Al-Thani also rejected any notion of shutting down the Qatar-based al-Jazeera satellite news network, suggested as a demand of the Arab nations.
Included on the sanctions list �� which was denounced as �쐀aseless and without foundation in fact�� by Qatar �� are the Qatari-funded Qatar Charity and Eid Charity and several prominent figures including businessmen, politicians and senior members of the ruling family, one a former interior minister.
The list also includes the Muslim Brotherhood�셲 spiritual leader, Youssef al-Qaradawi, who is based in Doha, and individuals in Libya as well as Shia groups in Bahrain seen by some Gulf Arab governments as linked to Iran.
The Qatari government said on Friday: �쏻e do not, have not and will not support terrorist groups. The recent joint statement issued by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE regarding a �쁳error finance watchlist�� once again reinforces baseless allegations that hold no foundation in fact.
�쏰ur position on countering terrorism is stronger than many of the signatories of the joint statement �� a fact that has been conveniently ignored by the authors.��
The sanctions list further tightens the screws on Qatar, home to a key US military base and the host of the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
It also strongly suggests a widening of the aggressive Saudi-led campaign beyond Qatar itself �� not least against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt �� where Youssef al-Qaradawi was tried and sentenced to death in absentia following the 2013 military overthrow of the elected president Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood member.
Although Qatar has long denied supporting or funding terror groups, western diplomats have accused it of allowing the funding of some Sunni extremists, such as al-Qaida�셲 branch in Syria. The same accusations have been levelled against individuals in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
A leading diplomat from the UAE told the Guardian on Thursday that the Gulf states had lost all trust in Qatar.
Omar Saif Ghobas, the UAE�셲 ambassador to Russia, said: �쏷here is no trust, it has gone. So when the Qatari foreign minister says, �쁋isten, we need to engage in dialogue,�� we have done that for many years �� that�셲 just a statement for western consumption.��
The crisis has provoked anxieties in Qatar, a leading gas exporter as well as an international travel hub, whose flagship carrier Qatar Airways has been forced to fly circuitous and expensive routes over Iran and Turkey after being blocked elsewhere in the Middle East.
It has largely played out in diplomatic moves and via the pages of competing Middle Eastern media organisations, but it has also been marked by hacking attacks.
On Thursday, al-Jazeera said it had been targeted in a sustained cyber-attack. Al-Jazeera�셲 offices have been shut down by authorities in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
It sounded like a missile at first, the air above Washington filled with the terrifying roar of displaced air. Then the Pentagon was rocked by the thud of an explosion, and staff inside its fortified walls, who had been watching in horror the terrible images from New York, realised that the epicentre of US military might was also under attack.
The medium-sized jet had come in low over Arlington and the Navy Annexe, before screaming into the south-west face of the Pentagon around 9.30am.
"There was a huge noise and I got out of the car as the plane came over," said Afework Hagos, who was on his way to work but was stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the plane flew over.
"Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in."
Omar Campo, who had been cutting the grass on the other side of the road when the plane flew over his head, said: "The whole ground shook and the whole area was full of fire. I could never imagine I would see anything like that here."
Barely 30 minutes after two other passenger jets had ploughed into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York, the Washington attack tipped the US into a panic-fuelled state of siege. In that moment, what initially appeared to be a catastrophic but isolated terrorist outrage was transformed into an unprecedented full-frontal assault on America and its people.
From start to finish, the terrorist operation took barely three hours. In that time, those responsible managed to hijack four US airliners inside the supposedly well-guarded confines of US airspace and use them to reduce the country's two most important cities to war zone-like scenes of carnage.
By the time most east coast Americans had turned up at their desks, the operation was already well under way. Just after 8am, the terrorists had seized control of two airliners minutes after take-off from Logan airport in Boston. Another flight was hijacked shortly after leaving Washington Dulles, while the fourth had just left Newark, New Jersey.
But even after two of the jets had ploughed into the World Trade Centre less than an hour later, Americans still had no idea of the scale of devastation that was yet to unfold upon them. President George Bush was in Florida, visiting an elementary school where he had been reading stories with some of the pupils. As the scale of the carnage in New York became apparent, he cut the visit short and in a hastily convened news conference, announced that he was returning to Washington immediately.
But just as Mr Bush was appearing before the cameras, reports were emerging that another passenger plane had been hijacked. Military officials in Washington had been informed that the aircraft was heading in their direction from New York. Minutes later, the capital was thrown into chaos.
Tim Tinnerman, a pilot, watched as the airliner - which he said was an American Airlines Boeing 757 - hit the Pentagon. "It added power on its way in," he said. "The nose hit, and the wings came forward and it went up in a fireball."
"It was a huge fireball, a huge, orange fireball," said Paul Begala, a consultant with the Democratic party. Another wit ness also claimed the blast had blown up a helicopter circling overhead.
Inside the building, there was pandemonium. Terrified civilian and military staff were screaming as a serious fire took hold.
Smoke and flames poured out of a large hole punched into the side of the Pentagon. Emergency crews rushed fire engines to the scene and ambulancemen ran towards the flames holding wooden pallets to carry bodies out. A few of the lightly injured, bleeding and covered in dust, were recovering on the lawn outside, some in civilian clothes, some in uniform. A piece of twisted aircraft fuselage lay nearby. No one knew how many people had been killed.
Red, yellow and green sectors had been established on a nearby road, prepared to handle the different degrees of casualties once victims were brought out, but rescue workers were finding it nearly impossible to get to people trapped inside, beaten back by the flames and falling debris.
"The fire was intense," Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in a makeshift briefing at a gasoline station across the street from the building.
"It's terrible in there," said one firefighter, Derek Spector, who was with one of the first units to arrive at the scene. "But we didn't come across any casualties."
The regular Pentagon helicopter pad was not usable, scattered with debris from the plane and the explosion. But helicopters were landing and taking off from a cordoned-off area nearby. Within minutes, ambulances and a busload of trauma experts arrived from the army's Walter Reed hospital in Washington.
Law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plane that struck the Pentagon was the American Airlines jetliner that had taken off from Dulles on a scheduled flight to Los Angeles. Among the passengers was Barbara Olson, the wife of solicitor general Theodore Olson. Mrs Olson, a CNN commentator, had frantically called from her mobile phone to say her plane had been hijacked.
A spokesman for her husband later revealed she had not even been due to fly on the flight. "She flew a day early to make sure she could be at Ted's birthday," he said. "She called and said she was locked in the toilet and the plane had been hijacked. She said they had box-cutters and knives. They had rounded up the passengers at the back of the plane.
She referred to them as more than one. There was nothing she could do. She said to her husband: 'What do I do?'" The call ended seconds before the crash. Her husband, who had been George Bush's lawyer during the legal battle over the disputed presidential election, was said to be distraught.
The brunt of the impact had been taken by the third and fourth floors of the Pentagon's outer ring, which housed senior navy personnel, including three-star officers and vice admirals. There were also offices used by secretaries of the different armed services and the assistant secretaries. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, escaped unharmed.
High alert Across the country, America began pulling up the drawbridges within minutes of the Pentagon attack. President Bush ordered US forces worldwide on to high alert status - force protection condition Delta - and the authorities immediately began deploying troops, including a regiment of light infantry, in Washington.
As the aviation authorities worked frantically to account for the safety of all airliners in domestic air space, every airport was closed down and all flights in US airspace were ordered to land. International flights en route to the US were diverted to Canada.
In Washington, all government buildings, including the state department, the Capitol building and the White House, had been evacuated after the New York attacks and the nine top leaders of the house and senate taken into federal protection. But as fears of further attacks spread, public buildings across the country were also evacuated as the government began shutting down national landmarks, including the Washington Monument, the Statue of Liberty and the St Louis Gateway Arch. Even Disneyworld in Orlando closed its doors.
On the streets of Washington, panic set in. People rushed from buildings and desperately tried to get to their children in schools and daycare centres to make sure they were safe. Drivers ran red lights and sped across intersections, sending pedestrians scattering in a bid to get out of the city. Police near the White House tried to direct traffic, but a few blocks away chaos reigned, thwarting the efforts of emergency vehicles.
Wailing sirens from fire engines, police patrols and ambulances mingled with car horns, whistles and human cries.
"We are all sitting ducks here. We can't get out of the city. If they want to bomb the city we are all just waiting," one federal employee said.
"I feel like they are getting closer and closer with every minute," said Leroy Hall, a World Bank worker.
Just after 10am, the situation worsened again. Five minutes after the first World Trade Centre tower collapsed in New York, masonry started falling from the Pentagon. Then, without warning, a 40-yard section collapsed leaving a yawning gap from which flames continued to shoot. Stanley St Clair stumbled along the road away from the vast building, covered in dust. He had been working on renovations on the first floor of the section which was struck by the plane.
"It shook the whole building and hurt our ears. Papers and furniture and debris just went flying through the hallway and I thought it was a bomb or something. Then someone started shouting get out, get out."
Renovation work on the upper floors had just been completed and they had been handed back to the defence department. "This is the second Pearl Harbour. I don't think that I overstate it," Senator Chuck Hagel told reporters.
At 10.15am, another alert was sounded in Washington. "Get them out of here. We've got another threat coming," a policemen yelled, pushing survivors back from the building. Another officer said a report had come in saying another plane was on its way into Washington.
US air force F-16 fighter jets were scrambled, one of them banking steeply around the Pentagon, as the air around the defence department began to buzz with military and police helicopters.
At 10.27am in New York, the second tower of the World Trade Centre came tumbling down.
Minutes later, news broke of another crash, this time around 80 miles south-east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At 9.58am, an emergency dispatcher had answered a telephone call from a man who said he was a passenger locked in a bathroom on United Airlines flight 93. "We are being hijacked, we are being hijacked," he told the dispatcher, while repeatedly insisting that the call was not a hoax. The plane was "going down", he said. He had heard some sort of explosion and said there was white smoke coming from the aircraft. Then the dispatcher lost him.
The plane, a Boeing 757, which had left Newark, New Jersey, at 8.01am with 45 passengers and crew on board bound for San Francisco, had crashed into fields north of Somerset County airport. There were no survivors. "There's a crater gorged in the earth, the plane is pretty much disintegrated. There's nothing left but scorched trees," said one local, Mark Stahl.
There was immediate speculation that the plane had been heading for another high-profile target: Camp David, the US presidential retreat, which lies in the Maryland mountains 85 miles south-east of the crash site.
By mid-morning, the wide and normally crowded bridges across the Potomac were deserted and the scene resembled a city at war: deserted streets, billowing smoke and warplanes circling above. An elderly man, Tom O'Riordan standing in the shade of a tree near the Jefferson Memorial said he had not seen anything like it since Pearl Harbour.
A mobile secret service command center raced west on H Street, with sirens blaring, shortly after 11am as police drew a growing perimeter around the White House. Metal gates and yellow tape blocked access to streets and alleys. People scrambled to find working pay phones or reach friends or family on cell phones.
At 11.30, police cars again screamed up and down the roads around the Pentagon ordering passers-by off the street. One officer said there had been another report of an incoming plane heading down the Potomac river at high speed.
By midday, local hospitals reported receiving 40 victims of the attack, with seven patients in critical condition admitted to one facility for treatment of burns. Long lines of blood donors queued up outside area hospitals. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the city's Roman Catholic leader, said an unusually large number of worshippers, between 3,000 and 4,000, attended Mass at the downtown cathedral as the enormity of the destruction began to sink in.
By then, America had virtually ground to a halt. Almost every aspect of life, from sports occasions to family events, had been put on hold as the nation struggled to come to terms with what had happened. For several hours, the volume of people using the telephone service had made it impossible for anyone outside the US to phone in, and with international flights diverted away from the country, it had closed itself off to the outside world.
It was mid-afternoon before details of the hijacked planes started to emerge. The first announcement came from American Airlines, which confirmed that it had lost flight 11 from Boston to LA with 92 passengers and crew and flight 77 from Washington Dulles to LA with 64 people on board. Shortly after, United announced that the plane which had crashed in Pennsylvania was its flight 93, a Boeing 757 which had been en route to San Francisco from Newark, New Jersey. It had also lost another plane, flight 175, a Boeing 767 from Boston to LA.
Dismay
 Across the US, passengers queuing for flights and relatives waiting to meet arriving planes stood in airport lobbies staring at the arrival and departure monitors and listening with a growing sense of bewilderment and dismay to the announcements over the loudspeakers. Every major airport has had its rehearsals for disaster but not since Pearl Harbour had the country experienced such a widespread series of attacks.
Los Angeles International airport, the destination for three of the four hijacked flights, announced a suspension of operations as soon as it became clear what had happened. Worried callers were diverted to the lines of American Airlines and United, which were trying to supply information of who had been on the flights.
The airport itself was closed to the public and its operations suspended with only key staff allowed to remain. California governor Gray Davis made the National Guard available to assist.
Grief counsellors were called in by American Airlines and United to be ready to meet the friends and relatives of those on the flights. Switchboards were jammed as people tried to get information from the airport.
Lieutenant Howard Whitehead of the Los Angeles police said: "We are working with all the other agencies and a total evacuation of the airport has been ordered for precautionary reasons. Right now everything is fluid."
Kenyan security forces were slow to respond to attacks on villages along the country�셲 coast last year and afterwards arbitrarily detained and beat Muslims and ethnic Somalis as well as stealing personal property, claims a report by rights groups.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the Kenya Human Rights Commission urged the government to increase its oversight of police and military investigations, noting that a year after the deadly coastal attacks, for which the Islamist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility, no one has been held accountable.
Kenya is facing its most serious security crisis in decades as al-Shabaab wages a campaign of terror along its border with Somalia, with sporadic attacks elsewhere. In April, the terror group laid siege to Garissa University campus, killing 148 people.
In the report, Insult to Injury: The 2014 Lamu and Tana River Attacks and Kenya�셲 Abusive Response, the rights groups documented assaults on the coastal town of Mpeketoni, near the tourist island of Lamu, and on several other villages in the Lamu and Tana River counties in June and July 2014. At least 87 people were killed in the attacks.
The deadliest assault happened in Mpeketoni, where armed men drove into town, threw explosives into the police station and shot civilians at random, killing at least 48 people.
In interviews in eight villages in the area in October, the rights groups recorded not only witness accounts of the attacks but also allegations of abuse by security forces.
The report, published on Monday, said hundreds of people had been beaten and detained without charge while communities remained vulnerable to further attacks. It criticised security services for failing to respond and for detaining terror suspects on flimsy charges for longer than 24 hours, the maximum amount of time suspects can be held without charge under Kenyan law.
�쏧 think they only stopped beating us because they were tired,�� one 42-year-old man, who was detained by Kenyan police last year, told researchers.
Leslie Lefkow, the deputy Africa director of HRW, said: �쏷here�셲 a pattern here of the authorities scapegoating the wrong targets in their response to terrorist attacks. Whether that�셲 beating up and rounding up community members because of their ethnicity or their religion, or what we�셶e seen with the way that they�셶e gone after some of the NGOs on the coast, who have been working on these issues and documenting human rights violations.��
Thinktanks have warned that the Kenyan government�셲 targeting of Muslims could drive radicalisation in the country.
�쏛 response that ignores basic rights is not effective, and only risks making the situation worse,�� said Davis Malombe, deputy director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission.
Part of the problem is poor coordination between different government ministries and inadequate police work, HRW said. �쏷he lack of police investigation �� questioning of witnesses, taking of statements, collecting of evidence �� is a pattern that we�셶e observed in a number of different places and at different times,�� Lefkow said.
�쏯o one here has recorded a statement with police because the police have not asked for statements. We don�셳 know how they are carrying out investigations if they cannot talk to those who saw the attackers or the survivors,�� an employee of the Kenya Red Cross told researchers.
Kenya�셲 inspector general of police, the chief of general staff and the director general of the Kenya Wildlife Service did not respond to requests for comment, the rights groups said.
With more power being ceded to security services, including expanded rights to use firearms and detain suspects, the government must improve its oversight of police in order to fend off terrorists and protect civilians, the study said.
�쏫enyan authorities have not conducted any known investigations into human rights abuses by its counterterrorism forces, despite credible allegations of abuse,�� it said.
While efforts by Kenya�셲 Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to hold police to account were applauded by the report�셲 authors, they called for further action. �쏷here is an urgent need for political will to undertake the kind of reforms that will improve the security response and make Kenya safer,�� Lefkow said.
The report said the IPOA should �쐃nsure all those implicated in human rights abuses are removed from their positions and held to account��.
Last week, the Kenyan government announced a 짙180m rise in funding for counterterrorism operations in its latest budget (pdf).
Kenya�셲 security services also receive funding from the US, the UK and other international donors, who have not spoken out publicly against recent reports of rights abuses. �쏧�셫 sure there is discussion privately on some of these concerns, but the question is whether the oversight and pressure for reforms is really at the level it needs to be,�� Lefkow said.
The country�셲 tourism sector, one of the pillars of the economy, is paying the price of deepening insecurity as governments warn their citizens to stay away from popular coastal resorts like Lamu, Mombasa and Malindi.
Kenya said the threat of terrorist attacks could damage its development agenda, which aims to transform the republic into a middle-income country by 2030. �쏻ithout security for our citizens, achieving our growth and development objectives will remain a mirage,�� Kenya�셲 finance minister, Henry Rotich, said on 11 June in an address to the country�셲 parliament.
There are no �쏧 heart KBL�� signs. No #jesuisbaghdad hashtags. No one is paying tribute to the rich cultural heritage and resilience of the targets. It is unlikely that we will come to recognise the names and faces of most victims. But the bombs that struck Kabul on Wednesday morningstruck Kabul yesterday morning and Baghdad late on Monday were as devastating to their residents as the attack on the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester a week earlier. That should not need saying, of course; yet the insecurity that Afghans and Iraqis face can blur the impact of atrocities into a general impression of perpetual chaos and pain for outsiders. That terror strikes so often �� and particularly in the month of Ramadan �� does not dull its effect on those who experience it. Repeated suffering compounds trauma.
In the case of the ice-cream parlour targeted in one of four bombings in the Iraqi capital that day, the parallels with the British attack were unmissable: among the 17 fatalities were mothers and young daughters out enjoying an evening�셲 innocent pleasure together, after breaking their Ramadan fast. The intended prey of the vast device that rocked the Afghan capital is less clear: it was hidden inside a sewage tanker, and the Nato-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul said Afghan security forces prevented it from entering the diplomatic zone, so its intended target may well have been foreign. But a bomb on this scale �� leaving a crater perhaps 4 metres deep �� was always going to claim civilian lives. Most of the 90 or more victims it killed, and the hundreds more who were injured, appear to have been ordinary workers. Just as in Manchester, families have been torn apart and their wider communities left fearful. And that is, of course, the purpose: to sow dread, division and a perpetual sense of uncertainty, of living on the brink of disaster.
Much about these attacks remains to be determined, though Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Baghdad attacks and its Amaq website said the attack on the ice-cream parlour in Karrada district targeted a �쐅athering of Shia��. It has an obvious motive to step up such attacks as it struggles to hold on to what remains of the caliphate it proclaimed; but, of course, it has pursued civilian targets through the years. Last year, 300 died when a bomber �� claimed by Isis �� struck a mall in Karrada during Ramadan.
Isis has staged large-scale terror attacks in Kabul; equally, the Taliban�셲 denials of involvement in Wednesday�셲 massive blast are not necessarily reliable. What is clear is that the Afghan attack is further evidence of the country�셲 deteriorating security situation following the departure of most western troops in 2014. Kabul is regarded as a more secure part of the country; if it cannot be protected, where can people feel safe? This혻attack will therefore, inevitably, figure in the United States�� decision on whether to deploy further personnel. The prospect cannot inspire anyone with great hope; the western presence has proved itself incapable of supporting peace. Yet withdrawing more troops would likely be disastrous in both strategic and humanitarian terms. There is no혻exit in sight.
It also raises further questions about the European Union deal to deport unlimited numbers of Afghan asylum seekers whose claims have been refused, reached with the threat of cuts in aid hanging over the head of Kabul and despite security concerns. Angela Merkel rightly stressed on Wednesday that terrorism �쐔argets all of us whether in Manchester or Berlin, Paris, Istanbul, St혻Petersburg or today in Kabul��. But Germany is postponing, not reviewing, deportation flights, and that is on logistical grounds.
On Tuesday, hours after the blast, builders were working at the al-Faqma ice-cream parlour, plastering over cracks and repointing walls. By evening the streets and restaurants were full again with families, demonstrating the resilience that was feted in Manchester and is taken for granted in the places that must summon it time and time again.
The terror suspect who escaped surveillance by disguising himself as a woman in a burqa was under restrictions to stop him travelling overseas to support terrorism, the home secretary has told MPs.
Theresa May defended the use of terrorism prevention and investigation measures, or Tpims, after the disappearance of the Somali-born suspect, Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, from a west London mosque on Friday.
Mohamed, 27, is a British citizen and is the second suspect on a Tpim order to go missing in the last year. The first, Ibrahim Magag, disappeared off the security service's radar after he ripped off his tracking tag and jumped into a black cab in Camden Town, north London.
Mohamed went missing from the mosque in Acton, west London, only hours after an Old Bailey prosecution against him for tampering with his electronic tag was discontinued when the crown offered no evidence.
May said the police and security services did not believe Mohamed represented a direct threat to the British public. But he has been linked with the Somali militant group al-Shabab, and is believed to have helped various individuals to travel from Britain to Somalia to engage in terrorism-related activity.
The Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command has launched an intensive hunt. His photograph and details have been circulated to all ports and airports. May said the police held his UK passport.
She defended the Tpims regime, saying its abscondence record was little different to that of the control-order regime, which it replaced last year, under which seven terror suspects disappeared in six years.
"The police and security service have confirmed that they do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK," she said. "The reason he was put on a Tpim in the first place was to prevent his travel to support terrorism overseas." In the Commons, May also repeatedly had to reject calls from backbench Tories to ban the burqa and other face coverings after Mohamed's disappearance: "It is not for the government to tell women how to dress," she told them.
The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, claimed the replacement of control orders with Tpims last year had made it easier for terror suspects to abscond. So far, two out of the 10 suspects placed on Tpims have gone missing.
Cooper particularly blamed the scrapping of "internal exile"or relocation orders, which would have left Mohamed unable to return to London to keep in contact with his network. Court documents show that the first suspect to abscond, Magag, was also a member of the same UK-based network supporting terrorism-related activity in Somalia.
"She was warned about changing the law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people would abscond and they have �� twice -but still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need?," said Cooper.
But May insisted that lessons had been learned since the first Tpims subject had disappeared. She said that resources for surveillance had been increased in the wake of the move from control orders to Tpims. The home secretary said it wrong to claim that control orders could prevent absconds �� 7 had disappeared in the six years they had been in force.
Perhaps most surprisingly, the home secretary, faced demands from three Tory MPs to introduce a ban on face coverings, including the burka, as a result of the case. One, Sir Gerald Howarth, said the burka should be banned "because it is alien to our culture, and has enabled this man to abscond". It was a demand May found easy to dismiss saying while there were times, such as at the border or in court, when it was right to require face coverings to be removed, but as a matter of principle "it is for an individual woman to decide how she dresses herself".
The Tpims regime allow the home secretary to impose restrictions on travel, communication, finance and an overnight curfew of terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted or deported. Tpims can be extended for a year for another 12 months before they expire.
Scientists at the top-secret military research unit at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have been assessing the potential use of Ebola as a bioterrorism weapon, according to confidential documents.
A three-page memo, marked �쁕K secret UK eyes only��, reveals that the unit, where chemical, radiological and biological threats are analysed, was tasked with evaluating whether terrorist organisations such as al-Qaida and Islamic State (Isis) could use the deadly virus to attack western targets.
The heavily redacted document, which has been released under the Freedom of Information Act, reveals that the unit was asked last October to provide �쐅uidance on the feasibility and potential impact of a non-state actor exploiting the Ebola outbreak in west Africa for bioterrorism��.
It goes on to explain that non-state actor threat assessments are �쐏rovided by the joint terrorism analysis centre��, while threats to �쏹K deployed forces are provided by defence intelligence��. The memo outlines three possible scenarios under which terrorists might seek to exploit the Ebola outbreak, which so far has killed more than 9,000 people in the three most affected countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The first scenario outlined is completely redacted, illustrating the acute sensitivity about the issue. The second scenario is heavily blacked out but, according to the memo, �쐗ould be both logistically and technically challenging for a non-state group to undertake��. It observes: �쏞learly there are practical issues involved with such a scenario that of themselves are often not insurmountable but taken together add enormously to the complexity of successfully undertaking this attack.��
A third, also heavily redacted, scenario �쐁onstitutes the most technically challenging of the scenarios considered here��.
Concerns that terrorist groups might look to �쐗eaponise�� Ebola have been raised by several thinktanks and politicians. Last year Francisco Martinez, Spain�셲 state secretary for security, claimed that Isis fighters were planning to carry out �쐋one wolf�� attacks using biological weapons. Martinez said that his belief was informed by listening in to conversations uncovered in secret chatrooms used by terrorist cells. The claim has since been played down by others.
Jeh Johnson, the US department of homeland security secretary, said last October that �쐗e�셶e seen no specific credible intelligence that Isis is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland��.
Dr Filippa Lentzos, a senior research fellow at King�셲 College London and an expert on bioterrorism, said terrorists looking to use the virus as a weapon would encounter problems. �쏧t doesn�셳 spread quickly at all,�� she said. �쏷errorists are usually after a bang and Ebola isn�셳 going to give you that.��
On average, a person infected with Ebola will infect two more people. In a developed country such as the UK transmission would be even more limited.
�쏱eople with Ebola are infectious only when they show symptoms,�� Lentzos said. �쏞ould terrorists go to west Africa, get infected, then come back and sit on the tube? Sure, but they�셱e not likely to be functional for very long. They�셱e going to be very sick and you�셪l see that. So they would have only a very small window in which to operate. And in a country with a developed public health system like the UK, there would be plenty of chances to clamp down on an outbreak.��
Other biological weapons would potentially be more attractive to terrorists, experts suggested. Unlike Ebola, which requires the transmission of body fluids, anthrax spores can be dried and milled down to form tiny particles that can be inhaled.
However, even the suggestion that Ebola could be weaponised made it a potentially powerful weapon for terrorists, Lentzos suggested. �쏧f your aim is not to kill a lot of people, or even make them ill, but instead to frighten them and cause a huge level of societal disruption, then bioterrorism would do that. It elicits exceptionally high levels of fear, disgust and abhorrence.��
The use of pathogens as a weapon has been tried before. Following the attacks in New York and Washington in 2001, five people died in the US after opening letters laced with anthrax. In the 1980s, a cult in Oregon spread salmonella on salad bars in restaurants in an attempt to keep voters from the polls so its preferred candidates would win.
�쏷he risk of small-scale bioterrorism attacks is possible and very likely,�� Lentzos said.
Porton Down is known to have experimented with Ebola but a specific request for the laboratory to analyse the virus�셲 potential use by �쐍on-state agents�� highlights the growing concern that terrorists are becoming increasingly inventive in their choice of weapons.
One scenario could see terrorists combining genes from different pathogens to synthetically create super pathogens that could spread disease far more effectively than Ebola. But Lentzos suggested this was unlikely. �쏧t�셲 pretty damn hard to make dangerous pathogens from scratch in the lab. Experts have a really hard time doing that. At this point I�셫 not sure that�셲 what we need to worry about.��
Lentzos said that focusing on the terrorist threat posed by Ebola risked losing sight of the bigger picture. �쏷o beat Ebola we have to worry less about terrorism and more about public health. Disease knows no borders.��
Marched on to a Libyan beach in now gruesomely familiar orange jumpsuits, the last moments of 21 Coptic Christians carried the vicious jolt of previous Isis snuff videos, but with an added charge of fear.
The setting, in Libya, suggested that the group was spreading further and faster than even their dramatic early advances seem possible, and it came after vows of allegiance to Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by militants from Afghanistan to Yemen.
�쏻ith affiliates in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, the group is beginning to assemble a growing international footprint,�� Marine Corps Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, warned the US House of Representatives this month.
The beheading of a tourist in Algeria, a meticulously videoed attack on an Egyptian army base, including the casual murder of surviving soldiers, a suicide bombing in Tripoli�셲 smartest hotel �� all were recently masterminded by militants publicly loyal to a group whose name once defined its geography: �쏧slamic state in Iraq and Syria��.
Affiliates are adopting their slick media production along with bloody tactics, amplifying the influence of the violence. The murder of the Egyptian Christians has already drawn bombing raids on Libya by Egyptian jets, which may suit some Isis commanders keen to draw enemies into an expensive and draining war.
There are echoes of al-Qaida�셲 global expansion, even as its leader shrank into hiding, through loyal but virtually autonomous units in Yemen, north and east Africa, and other areas. But al-Qaida expanded slowly and carefully, vetting would-be allies that wanted to use its terrifying brand in their own battles.
Isis by contrast has already welcomed several would-be supporters under what seems to be a looser umbrella, among them Afghan fighters whom analysts say have significant theological differences with the group.
�쏧 think it�셲 important for us to differentiate between the spread of Isil and individuals who are trying to attract attention for themselves by claiming an association with Isil,�� said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. �쏷hose are two very different things. And I think the best example we have of this is the situation that we saw in Afghanistan.��
The wealth Isis commands, the extraordinary power of its brand, and its dramatic sweep from obscurity to power over large swathes of two nations make it an alluring patron. It can offer support in areas from financial to weapons supply to practical assistance with video productions, and has more than proved its attraction to potential foreign donors and fighters. Isis arrived in Egypt effectively overnight, when local insurgent group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in November. The group has several years�� experience fighting Cairo�셲 forces and perhaps 12 million pieces of weaponry hidden in the vast deserts there, according to one former intelligence official.
In Libya, where Isis now controls three towns, its roots are less clear, with some fighters signing up from a homegrown militia based in Benghazi city, and others returning from Syria. The group has advanced quickly though across a country rocked by civil war, highlighting its progress with regular displays of extreme violence.
Countries bordering the Isis heartland are worried that it will try to infiltrate their territory. Lebanon�셲 security chief warned earlier this month that Isis is seeking control of villages along the border with Syria to use as staging posts for operations.
�쏧slamic State does not want to dominate Qalamoun �� but they want to use it to secure their backs in the region,�� Major General Abbas Ibrahim, head of Lebanon�셲 General Security Office, told Reuters recently. �쏷he Lebanese military and security forces are on full alert.��
Beyond the immediate reach of Isis funds or tacticians, the group�셲 name has become so famous that it may have an attraction for those with an interest in its policies.
In January this year, after a steady trickle of reports from Afghanistan that Taliban commanders were signing up to join Isis, the group officially announced its first outpost beyond the Arab world, in �쏫horasan��, an ancient name for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Many analysts were sceptical that Afghan commanders declaring their loyalty were doing anything more than pursuing local rivalries with the latest tool to hand. They have so far avoided the sectarian atrocities that Isis has embraced in Iraq and Syria, and in some places are even reluctant to fly the black flag of the group they claim to serve.
�쏧n practice, the IS groups in Helmand and Farah have not been involved (so far) in actions that resemble the brutality or sectarianism of the mainstream Isis,�� said Borhan Osman, who has researched the group for the Afghanistan Analyst Network, and pointed out the theological disputes.
Isis could boast one Afghan commander with real links to the Isis heartland, a former Guant찼namo detainee, but he was killed by a drone strike in January.
�쏬aunching a militant offshoot in an unfamiliar land is one thing, seeing it grow into a solid force and sustaining it is another,�� Osman wrote, in a recent paper about the group, that warned against exaggeration. �쏛fghanistan and Pakistan are a long way from the group�셲 heartland and it may have miscalculated its appeal.��
The number of tourists visiting France has dropped 7% since January, with foreigners deterred by terror attacks, bad weather and transport strikes, the foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, has said.
�쏷ourist arrivals since the start of the year have fallen by 7% across the country,�� with Paris worst hit, said Ayrault, who is also tourism minister.
France is the world�셲 leading tourist destination. The sector accounts for around 9% of its gross domestic product (GDP). The industry has been struck a severe blow from terror attacks by Islamic State, closing down festivals and other public events and prompting visitors to stay away.
�쏷he attacks partly explain these disappointing trends,�� said Ayrault. �쏷he perception of risk has an influence on some clients, notably the wealthiest or those from Asia.��
He added that economic difficulties in countries including Russia and Brazil had also affected visitor numbers from those countries.
Pictures of flooded streets �� the result of 50 more days of rain in the second quarter compared with normal levels �� and public sector strikes also played a part, he added.
Paris alone has seen an 11.4% drop in hotel nights and a loss of ��1bn in income since January. Francois Navarro of the regional tourism board said there had been46.2% fewer Japanese tourists to the Paris region, 35% fewer Russian visitors and a 27% drop in the number of Italians.
A terror attack in Paris in November last year that killed 130 people led to a drop in tourist numbers. Officials had hoped the trend would reverse after the successful hosting of the Euro football championship in July. But just days after the end of the competition a Tunisian believed to be acting for Islamic State rammed a lorry into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people.
The attack led to numerous summer events being cancelled due to security fears.
There was, in the early hours of Monday evening, joy in Manchester Arena: it was an Ariana Grande pop concert, an artist beloved by children and families. Then there was horror and a long night of blood. In an instant, the young life that coursed through that happy crowd was turned to death. It is no solace to know that we live in an age of terror. No easier to know, now, that on that spring night, among the thousands out in that northern English city, leaving pubs or walking home from a meal, preoccupied with their banal thoughts and quietly reassuring mundanities, there was a person whose thoughts were not banal or mundane at all. The result of a single suicide bomber�셲 lethal malice is the loss of 22 lives �� including that of an eight-year-old girl �� and dozens injured, some with life-altering wounds.
We must recognise that the aim of such a nauseating attack is to stir fear in our populations, and to change how we think about our lives and ourselves. A pop concert is a rite of passage for many young people, simultaneously signifying a break with the choices of parents whose musical tastes rarely coincide with their children�셲, while affirming a cultural affinity shared only by their peers. It is a mark of our times that such a moment in a young person�셲 life could be deemed a battleground, and that such innocence should be violently shredded in the pursuit of an ideological or political aim.
A bomb that strikes at the heart of Manchester�셲 civil life is something felt acutely at the Guardian. This is where the newspaper was founded, as the Manchester Guardian, almost 200 years ago, out of a distinctive Mancunian radical tradition, in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre in 1819 when 15 people were killed in protests over parliamentary reform. Throughout Manchester�셲 history, its people have campaigned for what they thought was right. It is a city that has never been afraid to challenge received wisdom; its capacity for innovation stretches from what may be the world�셲 first free public library and the first passenger railways, to the suffragette movement, vegetarianism and graphene. It is a special place, with a historic sense of confidence. It is a testament to the city that an attempt to divide a people only brought them closer together: doors were opened to strangers and meals offered to worried parents. Hotels and cabs provided services for free. As one taxi driver put it: �쏻e�셱e glue. We stick together when it counts.��
As a country we must resist the idea that we should give in to our deepest fears. A British-born man is said to be behind this heinous act. Terrorists can kill and maim. But they do not pose an existential threat to our nation, and it would be a mistake to elevate their importance as if they did. Late on Tuesday night the prime minister, Theresa May, raised the threat level, indicating a further attack maybe imminent. Care should be taken with more extreme measures that would only do terror�셲 work for it.
We must respond to the changing shape of the threat we face. Warnings from senior officers that frontline cuts are now too deep should be taken seriously. But we need smart policing focused on targeting suspects, not blanket measures. Given the slew of laws recently adopted in the name of national security, which human rights groups say are �쏿mong the most draconian in the EU��, there�셲 little reason to suggest more are needed. When she was home secretary, Mrs May had a worrying authoritarian bent, and her speeches seemed to stress policing people�셲 thoughts rather than their acts. This is not what is now required. Neither is the Conservative manifesto�셲 plan of new criminal offences. A better approach would be to uphold our values and adhere to the rule of law. We could win over the confidence of marginalised communities by cracking down on hate speech and crimes. Incendiary comments deliberately designed to inflame fraught situations should be investigated.
We should incorporate dissent and accommodate diverse voices, because we are a society that is prepared to debate and learn. In these ways we would show our way of life is a strength not a weakness. Terrorists succeed by frightening societies such as ours by changing the fundamental nature of who we are and how we operate as a democracy. Nations driven by paranoia and fear make poor decisions. Those trading in terror cannot change our way of life through their murderous acts. And we should not do it for them by losing sight of the values, such as those found in Manchester, that shape our nation.
The level of threat from international terrorism to Britain has been raised from substantial to severe, Theresa May, the home secretary, has announced.
This means that an attack is "highly likely", though May said there is no evidence to suggest an attack is imminent.
She said the decision to raise the official threat level is "related to developments in Syria and Iraq, where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the west".
The home secretary said some of the plots were likely to involve foreign fighters who had travelled to the Middle East from Britain and Europe to take part in the conflicts there.
Her announcement is expected to be followed shortly by a Downing Street statement by David Cameron.
The official threat level assessment last stood at "severe" more than three years ago when it was reduced to "substantial" on 11 July 2011. Severe is the fourth level in the five-tier system of alert categories that have been used by the government since 2006 to warn of terrorist activity. The only higher level is "critical", which is used when an attack is expected imminently.
May said the decision to raise the threat level had been taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre: "We face a real and serious threat in the UK from international terrorism. I would urge the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police," she said.
Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said the change in the threat level meant that established planning mechanisms across the police service had been activated: "This will lead to enhanced prevention and preparedness. From this afternoon we will begin to increase our levels of visible patrols and implement other security and protection measures. We will build on existing community relations to provide reassurance and seek their support and assistance in keeping the UK safe."
A range of factors lie behind the change of assessment of risk by the security services and counter-terrorism chiefs.
Anyone with information is urged to contact the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.
There are five levels of threat used by the JTAC. These are:
�� Severe - an attack is highly likely
�� Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely
�� Low - an attack is unlikely
Britain�셲 official terror threat level has been raised to critical, and troops have been deployed on the streets, after the country experienced its most deadly attack in a decade.
At least 22 people, including children as young as eight, were killed and 59 injured in a suicide bombing after pop singer Ariana Grande had performed at the city�셲 arena.

Munich remained on high alert on New Year�셲 Day after police received what they called �쐁oncrete warnings�� from foreign intelligence services that a Paris-style terrorist attack was imminent on two train stations in the city during new year celebrations.
No attack took place during the night and no arrests were made, and while the police continued to be out in force in the city, no manhunt for specific suspects was taking place.
There was some confusion over the seriousness of the terror threat that led to the temporary evacuation and closure of the stations. At a media conference on Friday morning, Munich�셲 police president, Hubertus Andr채, confirmed that police had received intelligence warnings of a group of five to seven Iraqis and Syrians who were about to carry out an attack, and that the reports had included names of �쏿bout half�� of the suspects.
But Andr채 was at pains to underline that the threat �� or even the existence of the suspects �� had not yet been confirmed by police.
�쏻e don�셳 know whether these names are right, whether these people exist, and where they are if they do,�� he told reporters. �쏷hat will then be the result of our thorough investigations. We can�셳 rule out that these people exist, but we can�셳 confirm it either.�� He added that the data on the individuals was detailed enough to be able to identify them if they exist, but he would not reveal what that information was.
Despite the lack of clear evidence, Andr채 refused to call last night�셲 events in Munich a false alarm. �쏧f the warnings are so concrete as they were in this case then we have to act,�� he said. �쏻e couldn�셳 say we�셪l just overlook it.��
Andr채 said the police operation had not put the city under a blanket lockdown, and that security measures had been concentrated and carried out �쏿lmost surgically��.
Andr채 also denied media reports that a warning had come in several days ago. While tipoffs are routine, the New Year�셲 Eve warning had only arrived with four hours�� notice, he said.
Citing anonymous security sources, regional state broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk reported earlier in the day that Munich police had investigated the threat of a potential Paris-style terror attack using Kalashnikovs and explosives several days ago following a tipoff from US intelligence agencies. A hotel had been searched and a surveillance operation had been carried out, BR reported, but no suspects had been found.
Andr채 insisted that this report had nothing to do with Thursday night�셲 events. �쏷he names that we were given last night do not have any association with the first warning,�� he said. �쏧 recommend people live their lives the way they�셱e used to.��
Some six hours after the attack on Mumbai began on Wednesday night, Indian media organisations received an e-mail from an unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen claiming responsibility for the deadly, well-planned operation. "We want to warn the Indian government that they must stop the injustice against the Muslim community," the email warned.
Security experts however remained sceptical about the existence of the Deccan Mujahideen. Such emails have been issued in the past by other jihadi outfits that have attacked Indian cities. What was unusual this time was the fact that the message was written in Hindi, and not, as on all previous occasions, in English.
An Indian TV news channel also reported that the internet connection used to send the email had been traced to Russia. "There are no 'indicators of authenticity' in this email," intelligence expert B Raman told NewsX channel. By adopting the name Deccan Mujahideen, analysts felt, the organisation behind the attack appeared to be trying to make it seem like the gunmen were from the Deccan plateau region in southern India, one of whose premier cities, Hyderabad, has a politically vocal Muslim population.
Major General RK Hooda, in charge of army operations at Hotel Trident in Mumbai, also told NDTV channel that a terrorist security forces had caught "tried to pretend that he was from Hyderabad." But Hooda added that intercepts had shown that the terrorists spoke to each other in Punjabi, a language spoken on both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border.
The emails sent out by the Indian Mujhideen (IM) group after recent bomb attacks on cities such as Ahmedabad and Delhi, on the other hand, were considered authentic by the authorities. Not only that, but after evading the law for years, several activists of IM were caught by police in at least five Indian provinces.The most significant breakthroughs came from the Maharashtra police �� both the anti-terror squad at the state level and the crime branch of the Mumbai police.
Among those arrested was Mansur Peerbhoy, a 31-year-old Yahoo India software engineer earning 짙25,000 a year, a princely salary in India. Peerbhoy is alleged to have been IM's head of internet operations. Though Peerbhoy was by far the most well-off among all the IM suspects arrested by the police, a majority of the others hailed from a similar background �� young, educated and middle-class.
Some others, especially those hailing from Azamgarh district in the eastern Uttar Pradesh state, were from humbler rural backgrounds and had been schooled in Islamic seminaries. But all seemed subsumed by the same passion �� to take revenge against the Indian state and even the Hindu majority for the atrocities committed against Indian Muslims, from the demolition of the Babri mosque in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992 to the more recent communal carnage in Gujarat state.
But all previous terror strikes associated with the IM have involved the planting of bombs in public places in crowded urban areas, such as Delhi's Connaught Place. Security analysts believe that the IM would not have the resources to conduct an operation like the latest Mumbai outrage on its own. In any case, the organisation is on the run following the recent police crackdown. However, stray members of the IM could have played a secondary, supportive role in the Mumbai attacks.
IM activists are said to have been motivated and trained by an allegedly shady businessman with underworld connections, Riyaz Bhatkal, alias Roshan Khan, wanted by the police and identified as IM's co-founder. As his name suggests, the gangster/businessman hails from Bhatkal town in the southern Karnataka state. But Bhatkal is still a relatively minor figure compared to the crime lords of Mumbai, a financial hub with a large and resourceful underworld.
None among Mumbai's crime bosses is more notorious than Dawood Ibrahim, accused by Indian authorities of having been the mastermind of the March 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai. The blasts had been executed in retaliation for attacks on Muslims by Hindu extremists following the demolition of the Babri mosque. At that time Ibrahim, wanted in Mumbai on murder, extortion and other charges, was living in Dubai.
But he subsequently moved to Karachi, and Indian intelligence alleges that he is holed up in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan ever since Washington also put him on its terror list for his links with the Al Qaida. Ibrahim though is a ruthless, multi-millionaire crime boss with operations in several countries, especially in South Asia. His syndicate is known to have an extensive network in India, particularly in Mumbai, where some of his siblings still reside.
But if Ibrahim is involved, his gang members are suspected of having played a local, supportive role in the terror strike. "The latest attack on Mumbai has the stamp of Dawood Ibrahim," said a Delhi-based security expert who did not want to be identified. "Definitely the people who hit Mumbai were a mixture of local guys who know the city very well, and trained, hardcore fighters who came by sea."
In a television address to the nation on Thursday, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh identified the gunmen who attacked Mumbai as coming from "outside the country". It was clear to everyone which country he was referring to �� India's neighbour Pakistan, which had also been implicated by authorities in many other terror strikes in the past, such as the 1993 Mumbai blasts and the more recent attack on the Parliament building in Delhi.
Major General RK Hooda, GOC, Maharashtra, was more explicit. He told NDTV news channel that the attackers had come by boat from Pakistan. Other TV channels named a gunmen held by authorities as Abu Ismail, said to be a Punjabi-speaking youth from Pakistan. A satellite phone recovered from two dead terrorists reportedly showed calls made to Karachi before and after the attacks commenced.
Intelligence analysts suggested the prime suspect in the al-Qaeda-type operation would be the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the banned military wing of the Islamic organisation Markaz-ud-Dawa-al-Irshad headquarted in Muridke near the Punjab capital Lahore.
The Al-Qaeda linked LeT was founded in 1989 in the Kunar province of Afghanistan, and its fighters have been active in fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir since 1993. But security analyst Uday Bhaskar said "though it would be tempting to blame a Pakistan-based group, especially the LeT, we need to wait for some more evidence to establish the link".
In the past, the LeT was alleged to have close links with Pakistan's ISI agency. But on the basis of what is known so far, none of the Indian security analysts believe that the Pakistan security establishment would have played a role in the organising the Mumbai operation. "But former ISI or even retired Pakistan Navy officials could have been involved with the LeT," said an analyst.
In the early years after 9/11 the suicide belt, the car bomb and the homemade explosive device were the weapons of choice for jihadis: hidden, brutal and hard to counter.
But as 2015 heaves to a close, its atrocities littered across the calendar �� Charlie Hebdo, Sousse, Garissa, Tunis, Copenhagen and Paris �� it is the AK-47 that has come to the fore.
Across Europe more terrorist attacks have been carried out with Kalashnikov-type assault rifles this year than with any other device. In the 13 November Paris attacks, suicide bombers killed few but gunmen killed many. Further afield, in Tunisia and Kenya, it was also automatic weapons that did the damage.
The widespread availability of these guns has been known for years. But it took the scale of death meted out in Paris last month to force Europe to address the threat.
Now law enforcement officers across the continent are trying to establish some basic truths. Where do they come from? Who are the middlemen that deal in these deadly weapons? And why have they become so popular again?
Part of the answer can be found in a small cottage in the Balkan hinterland, beneath the mountains of central Montenegro. In one of two bare rooms, Zeljko Vucelic draws hard on a cigarette.
This is a poor place. Mould grows on the walls, damp seeps up from the floor, and the only possessions on show are an old TV, a cooker and a fridge.
The family has just about made ends meet for generations. But now Vucelic is facing the realisation that his brother, Vlatko, had been trying to make a little money on the side �� as a bit-part player in the vast weapons trade.
�쏧 haven�셳 been sleeping for nights. I�셫 trying to remember if there is anything to dig into, to grab and hold on to,�� said Zeljko Vucelic.
On 5 November Vlatko Vucelic was stopped on a German motorway with a whole arsenal in the boot: a revolver, two handguns, two grenades, 200g of TNT. And eight Kalashnikovs.
Police have not linked Vlatko to any terror plot. But they do believe he was a cog, albeit a small one, in the illegal firearms trade, worth an estimated $320m (짙210m) a year worldwide.
His journey, as detailed by the satnav, traced what experts believe is a well-worn route for weapons traffickers: Montenegro, through Croatia, Slovenia and on into Austria to a border crossing point into southern Germany near Rosenheim. The final destination was a car park in Paris.
When police use the word Kalashnikov to describe weapons they have seized, they are referring to a legendary brand that has had multiple reincarnations.
Designed by the Soviet general Mikhail Kalashnikov, the first model of the Kalashnikov gun, or AK-47, was introduced into active service in the Soviet army in 1948.
Today, however, the name applies to 200 types of AK-pattern assault rifles. According to Michael Hodges, author of AK47: The Story of the People�셲 Gun, there may be as many as 200m Kalashnikovs in the world, one for every 35 people.
They are manufactured �� legitimately, for international trade �� in more than 30 countries, with China leading the way.But legal weapons can quickly become illicit contraband. China exports principally to African states. There, they can end up on the illicit market either because underpaid soldiers sell them on, or because states supply rebel forces in other countries.
Libya, with its own civil war to feed and a lawlessness unrivalled almost anywhere on the continent, has emerged as a huge funnel for the weapons.
A report by a UN panel of experts on the arms embargo on Libya has found that weapons have been illegally passed to 14 countries outside its borders, although no evidence of Libyan-sourced firearms in Europe has yet been acknowledged publicly. Most experts believe, however, it is only a matter of time before they are found within the European Union.As well as the constant production of new AKs, at the rate of a million a year, there are tens of millions of Kalashnikovs in the western Balkans, the former Soviet Union and north Africa that are still working effectively, despite dating back to the 1980s and beyond.
In Albania alone, after unrest in 1997, about 750,000 Kalashnikovs disappeared, to become part of the black market in illicit firearms.
These older weapons, often rebuilt or reactivated by middlemen, are used by criminals and terrorists exploiting their extraordinary durability.
�쏧t�셲 a very simple piece of kit,�� said Mark Mastaglio, a UK-based ballistics expert. �쏧t�셲 very easy to use, that�셲 why you see 12-year-olds carrying them. It is tough, it works in all kinds of environments �� hot and sandy deserts, or in Siberia. Wherever it is stored it is resilient, and this is why it is so popular.��
In Serbia there are estimated to be up to 900,000 illicit firearms, mostly AK-type military weapons. In Bosnia there are an estimated 750,000 illegal weapons. Many simply went home with returning fighters as the protracted Balkan wars wound down in the late 1990s.
�쏛t the end of the wars, whole battalions took their arms home,�� said Aleksandar Radic, an arms expert. �쏤or the first few years many hid them, just in case. But then people started to sell them on the black market, for as little as ��100.��
Much of the heavy weaponry used in the Paris massacres appears to have come from Balkan sources.
Milojko Brzkovic, director of the Zastava arms factory in Serbia, said the serial numbers of eight rifles recovered by the French police suggested they were produced by his company. The M70 assault rifles �� the Yugoslav version of the AK-47 �� discovered in France were part of a batch sent to military depots in Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia by his firm.
But while discovering the origins of a weapon is helpful, it does little to help trace its path into the hands of an Islamist extremist.
�쏧t is really difficult to trace the life cycle of a weapon,�� said Ivan Zverzhanovski, based in Serbia, who works on a region-wide UN project to stop the uncontrolled proliferation and illicit trafficking of Kalashnikovs and other small arms.
�쏽ou might know the weapons were held in the Yugoslav army stock in the late 80s, but you don�셳 know where it was between the 80s and 2015. Therefore it�셲 really difficult to find out how they are really coming into Europe. Getting the right type of information is crucial.��
Vlatko Vucelic was allegedly part of what experts call the �쏿nt trade�� �� small-scale smuggling of firearms into and across Europe. Until the point he was stopped, his life had been unremarkable. He is no Mr Big.
Unmarried with no children, he has no criminal record and, according to his brother, struggled to get by, earning less than ��400 (짙290) a month working in a vineyard in the summer.
A month and a half before his trip, however, Vlatko Vucelic, a man who had never travelled abroad and rarely drove a car further than a few miles from his home, applied for his first passport and an international driving licence.
�쏷he guy who leaves his country for the first time, to take half the military barracks with him �� how is that possible?�� said Zeljko.
But it is a phenomenon that is entirely possible, as traffickers meet the demand for military-style weapons across Europe.
Zverzhanovski said: �쏷he working assumption, which is probably correct, is that firearms come via the same routes that drugs do. A lot comes by road. It is micro traffic. There are no cases of large-scale smuggling �� we are not seeing truckloads. It is two or three or five automatic pistols or disassembled assault rifles in cars or coaches.��
The volumes, compared with drug trafficking, are tiny �� a handful of Kalashnikovs, as opposed to cocaine smuggled in multiples of tonnes �� and the gangs behind the trade are also often tight-knit groups.
According to a report from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime: �쏷he organised crime group responsible for the trafficking could be as small as one well-placed broker and his conspirators on the receiving end.��
While gun trafficking is not as lucrative as drug dealing, there are still huge profits to be made. Kalashnikovs can be bought in the Balkans for around ��300 to ��500, and sold in Europe for up to ��4,500. But there is evidence, according to Nils Duquet of the Flemish Peace Institute, that prices are dropping, with an automatic rifle available for between ��1,000 and ��2,000.
Other attractions are the difficulties of detection, particularly across the Schengen borders, and the fact that in many European countries gun trafficking sanctions are less severe than drug smuggling penalties.
While the likes of Vlatko Vucelic are crucial to the trade, trafficking mules are not always required. In Denmark the main method of trafficking illicit firearms into the country is via heavy goods vehicles, primarily from the western Balkans, and in Sweden last year police intercepted a consignment of automatic weapons being transported in a box placed on a bus travelling from a town in Bosnia to Malm철. It was not accompanied by a passenger.
In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, the Slovakian authorities quietly redrew their laws on deactivated firearms, making it illegal to sell them online, and forcing collectors who choose to buy a decommissioned Kalashnikov to register the firearm.
Their actions came amid growing evidence that several of the Kalashnikov-type firearms used by the Kouachi brothers in the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, and by their friend Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people in a kosher supermarket two days later, were bought legally in Slovakia as decommissioned collectors�� items.
The illegal conversion of decommissioned weapons, from starter pistols to Kalashnikovs, takes place all over Europe. In 2013 an EU report spelled out the threat: �쏬aw enforcement authorities in the EU are concerned that firearms which have been deactivated are being illegally reactivated and sold for criminal purposes, [and that] items �� are being converted into illegal lethal firearms.��
While decommissioning a Kalashnikov allows it to be legally bought by collectors, the mechanics of rendering the weapon inoperable differ across Europe.
In the UK, according to Mastaglio, there is a �쐅old standard�� that means it is impossible for a firearm to be reactivated and used. But in some other countries, Slovakia included, it is the work of a couple of hours to make the weapon lethal again often by unblocking the barrel and re-installing the firing pin.
Investigations in France have focused on the trade in decommissioned weapons as a source for criminals, and now for terrorists. In 2013 the French arrested 45 people on suspicion of smuggling firearms from Slovakia and Bulgaria, in an investigation examining the �쐄low between arms collectors and criminal networks��.
Last year in Lille an investigation was opened into the middlemen who illegally reconverted decommissioned firearms. A Brussels-based engineer, a gun dealer in Belgium, and a Lille-based businessman, Claude Hermant, whose company deals in decommissioned firearms, have all been drawn into the inquiry.
Hermant has been held in custody since January, accused of the trafficking of decommissioned weapons. His lawyers say he has not been questioned in connection with the investigation into the attacks in Paris.
Brussels is thought to be another nexus for middlemen. With its history of lax firearms laws and a legal gun trade that has created a pool of talented firearms engineers, the unofficial European capital is at the centre of investigations into the sourcing of weaponry for terrorists.
Mehdi Nemmouche, accused of killing four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels; Ayoub el-Khazzani, accused of attempting a mass shooting on the Thalys train in August; and Coulibaly are all believed to have found weapons from middlemen in Brussels. Belgian investigators also suspect that local dealers may have provided some of the weapons to the men whose assault on cafes, bars, a football match and a concert hall in Paris left 130 dead on 13 November.
There are regular arrests of Belgians who have illegally manufactured guns from scratch or, as is often the case, have reactivated supposedly �쐂eactivated�� weapons. One reason for Khazzani�셲 gun jamming on the Thalys train was that it was apparently made from different bits reassembled in Belgium.
The scruffy streets around the Gare du Midi in Brussels are said to be where much of the illegal gun trading takes place. �쏷he transfer of firearms can happen anywhere: in someone�셲 apartment or a forest or a parking lot. It is certainly not limited to the area around the Gare du Midi,�� said Nils Duquet. �쏷his is a European problem. Wherever there is serious crime there will be a black market in guns.��
In the past two years, he said, terrorists had changed their modus operandi towards firearms rather than bombs.
�쏰ne reason is that the �� explosives are harder to get and firearms are more easily available on the illegal market,�� he said. �쏛utomatic weapons are very suited to hurting a lot of people in a short time and that is what terrorists want to do. So there is growing demand, and there is also growing supply too.��
In the past four years the illicit firearms trade has been growing to supply demand from criminals who are increasingly using AK-47s in countries such as France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
A senior Croatian official said firearms had recently overtaken drugs as the contraband of choice. In 2010 the French authorities revealed seizures of firearms had soared by 79%, with 2,710 weapons recovered. At the same time, the French police began to notice that criminals were increasingly using Kalashnikovs.
�쏻hat was emerging was new,�� Zverzhanovski said. �쏷he French, especially, started picking up a major increase in criminal activity involving firearms, especially assault rifles, around 2011. They did a report on it; their language shows how surprised they were.��
Europol, the European Union�셲 police intelligence unit, said in 2011: �쏷here is an upward trend [by organised criminal gangs] in the use of heavy small arms �� such as assault rifles.��
The growing evidence of a problem led the French to tighten their gun laws in 2012, creating tougher sanctions for gun trafficking, with penalties raised to a ��100,000 fine and seven years in jail.
But the availability and use of Kalashnikovs has continued, particularly in places such as Marseilles. In 2012 there were two shootings outside nightclubs on consecutive weekends in northern France by criminals armed with Kalashnikovs.
In March two people were killed and 10 injured when a criminal gang opened fire with Kalashnikovs in a pub in Gothenburg, Sweden. A Dutch police source said that since 2012 there had been 20 murders or attempted murders between criminal gangs who had used 44 types of firearms. Nearly half were Kalashnikov-type assault rifles.
Even in the UK, where the home secretary, Theresa May, boasts that tough border controls prevent the trafficking of powerful assault rifles into the country, police seized 22 Kalashnikov-style automatic assault rifles, nine 힋korpion machine pistols, 58 magazines and 1,000 live rounds in a van leaving Cuxton marina in Kent in August, following the arrival of a boat from France.
For investigators trailing how jihadi terrorists manage to get hold of such weaponry, the nexus between organised criminals and terrorism is crucial.
The crossovers are evident in a string of Islamist-inspired terror atrocities from Mohamed Merah�셲 gun attacks in south-western France in 2012, to Nemmouche, to the January attacks in Paris by the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly.
All were criminals who, having served prison sentences for their activities, emerged from their incarceration as newly radicalised jihadis with a mental address book of underworld contacts from their previous lives.
What is clear, according to Duquet, is that to obtain weapons it is not just money that is needed, but connections too. This is where often underestimated links between criminal gangs and European extremist networks can be important, he said.
The ability of these criminal extremists to access military hardware including Kalashnikovs has seen firearms rise to prominence as the weapon of choice for terrorists in Europe. According to the 2015 EU terrorism situation and trend report (pdf), firearms have become the most prevalent form of weaponry in terror attacks in the EU.
Inquiries into the slaughter in Paris are taking place against a backdrop of Europe rushing to close loopholes in legislation and fill in gaps in investigatory expertise that have existed for years.
When criminals used the weapons to mete out vengeance on each other the European authorities appeared leaden-footed. It was not until 2013 that Europol set up a unit of dedicated firearms experts. And according to a 2014 European commission report on gun trafficking in Europe, the last joint customs operation focusing on firearms was in 2006.
�쏧t is really only relatively recently that firearms trafficking within Europe has become a priority,�� said Nicolas Florquin, senior researcher at the Small Arms Survey. �쏞urrent knowledge on firearms smuggling in Europe remains patchy, gleaned from specific arrests and seizures, leading to wildly different estimates of the scale of the problem. It should not be so.��
In 2013 �� as evidence of the grey trade in decommissioned assault rifles grew �� discussions went on in the EU about the need to standardise methods to make the weapons inoperable. The changes, however, were deemed of �쐌edium�� priority.
But within four days of the Paris attacks last month, a directive to standardise the decommissioning of firearms to render them inoperable across the EU was hurriedly drawn up �� a move the commission admitted had been �쐓ignificantly accelerated�� in light of recent events. It includes stricter rules to ban the private ownership of Kalashnikov-style assault rifles, even in deactivated form.
In Montenegro, the family of Vlatko Vucelic are much less mobile than the guns he was arrested with. They cannot afford to travel to Traunstein, where he is being held, to speak to him. The Montenegrin police have told them there is no evidence Vlatko�셲 trade was linked to the Paris attacks, but that is only of little comfort to them.
�쏦ow much could he have been paid for this?�� asked his brother. �쏧f it was a million, I could somehow get my head round it. But for sure it wasn�셳 that. We have struggled in our life for 50 years; we could have kept on going like this for the next 10 years, for the rest of our lives. If my brother is guilty of this, I would personally convict him to 30 years in jail.��

The number of victims of the London Bridge atrocity has risen to eight after police searching for a missing Frenchman recovered a body from the Thames.
Next of kin of Xavier Thomas, 45, missing since Saturday�셲 attack, have been informed, though no formal identification has yet taken place, the Metropolitan police said.Those killed during the London Bridge attack include three French citizens, the French president said.
�쏻e have had confirmation of the new death toll this morning,�� Emmanuel Macron said on the steps of the 횋lys챕e palace. �쏛s far as French nationals are concerned, there have indeed been three fatalities and eight wounded. We are paying a heavy price in these attacks.�쒾ix of those confirmed to have died have now been named by relatives.
The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said one of the French citizens who had previously been unaccounted for �쐆as been identified among those who have died��.French media reports identified him as S챕bastien B챕langer, 36, who was reported missing by his girlfriend, Gerda Bennet.Another French victim, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, who was working in a French restaurant in Borough Market, has also been named by French media as having died.
Thomas, who was in London for the weekend with his girlfriend, is believed to have been thrown into the river Thames after being struck by the speeding van driven along London Bridge in the attack.The family of Sara Zelenak, 21, an au pair from Brisbane, who had been missing since being separated from friends in the chaos of the attack, has confirmed she is also among the dead.
Another Australian, Kirsty Boden, a 28-year-old nurse, died as she ran to help others during the attack. She worked as a theatre recovery nurse at Guy�셲 hospital.�쏛s she ran towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge, Kirsty sadly lost her life,�� her family said in a statement.
Boden is one of four Australians said to have been caught up in the terror attack.
As the process of identifying victims continues, Spanish authorities are still awaiting news of Ignacio Echeverr챠a. a 39-year-old missing HSBC banker. The Spanish foreign ministry has said they have no update, and are urging the British authorities to speed up the identification process.Christine Archibald, 30, a Canadian, and Londoner James McMullan, 32, were the first victims to be named by family members.On Monday the family of McMullan, who had been on a night out, said they believed he was among the victims. Although his body has not been formally identified, his sister Melanie McMullan said in a statement that his bank card had been found on a body at the scene, and that the family expected official confirmation on Wednesday.
McMullan was described by his sister as �쐓omeone who put friends and family above all else��. She insisted that the family would not be drawn into hatred by the atrocity. �쏻hile our pain will never diminish, it is important for us to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who would try to destroy us, and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals, and will only breed more,�� she said. �쏷his is not a course we will follow, despite our loss.��
Boden had been working in London since 2013. In a statement, her family said: �쏫irsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend. She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people. Helping people was what she loved to do in her job as a nurse and in her daily life.
�쏛s she ran towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge, Kirsty sadly lost her life. We are so proud of Kirsty�셲 brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty �� we love you and we will miss you dearly.��
She was a keen traveller and in a blog described herself as �쐉ust your average dreamer, with a full-time job and a constant longing to go where I haven�셳 been��. Recent posts were from Milan, Sofia, Lisbon and Kiev, for the 2017 Eurovision song contest. Urging others to travel, she had written: �쏛t the risk of sounding cliche, life is short and we should all use the time we have wisely,�� The Age reported.Paying tribute, Dame Eileen Sills, the chief nurse at Guy�셲 and St Thomas�� NHS foundation trust said: �쏫irsty was an outstanding nurse and a hugely valued member of the staff team in Theatres Recovery, described by her colleagues as �쁮ne in a million�� who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care.��
James McMullan, from Hackney in east London, had not been seen since he stepped out of the Barrowboy and Banker pub on Borough High Street for a cigarette five minutes before the attackers crashed their van directly outside.
Melissa McMullan had posted an appeal for information about her �쏿mazing and incredibly talented big brother�� on social media. She said he had been meeting up with school friends and had not been home or in contact since the attack. Friends had checked hospitals without success. The Londoner was about to launch an e-learning business.
Reading a statement announcing that James was believed to be among the victims after his bank card was found on one of those killed, Melissa, 30, said: �쏤rom his friends who were with him on the night, they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was. Words will never be able to match his essence. There will only ever be one James. Nowhere else will you find such humour and unique personality and someone who puts friends and family above all else. He was an inspiration.��
A Canadian victim was named by her family as Christine Archibald, from Castlegar, British Columbia. After graduating in social work from Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, she had worked at a homeless shelter. Her family said: �쏻e grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister. She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected.
�쏶he lived this belief, working in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. Please honour her by making your community a better place. Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you.��
Archibald was with her fiance, Tyler Ferguson, when she died. His sister, Cassie Ferguson, told CBC News: �쏦e is broken into a million pieces. He held her and watched her die in his arms.��
Canada�셲 prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was heartbroken at the news. �쏻e grieve with the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, and wish all those injured a speedy and full recovery,�� he said.
�쏬ondoners and people across the United Kingdom have always displayed strength and resilience in the face of adversity. We recently witnessed this after the attacks in Manchester and in the Westminster area of London. This time will be no different.��
Three French citizens are believed to have died. Two are confirmed killed, while police searching for a third missing man have recovered a body from the Thames. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: �쏧t is with great sadness that I have learned that one of the French citizens, who was previously given as unaccounted for, has been identified among those who have died.��
Le Drian did not name the victim but French media identified him as S챕bastien B챕langer, 36, from Angers, a chef at the Coq d�섲rgent restaurant in the City who friends and relatives said had been watching the Champions league final with friends in a Borough market restaurant called Boro Bistro. B챕langer, who had lived in London for seven years, was reported missing by his girlfriend, Gerda Bennet, a bartender in Hoxton in the east of the city.Appealing for information online, she said: �쏮y heart is broken and I wish no one in this world could feel what I feel now.��
B챕langer�셲 cousin, C챕line, told RTL radio that he and his friends �쐀ecame separated when the attackers entered the bar. They all ran in different directions to escape, and lost contact with each other��.
Le Parisien newspaper said it had confirmed his death late on Tuesday night, adding that his mother and brother were expected to arrive in London on Wednesday. The paper said B챕langer had begun the evening in the The Barrowboy & Banker pub before moving on to the bistro.French media on Tuesday named Alexandre Pigeard, 27, from Normandy, who moved to London two-and-a-half years ago and was working on Saturday night at the Boro Bistro, as also having died.
La Manche Libre quoted residents from Pigeard�셲 home town, Colleville-Montgomery near Caen as saying his death had been confirmed by the mayor. �쏦e was a kid who wanted to succeed, who loved life,�� one resident told the newspaper.
The paper said he was a familiar figure in Caen, where he had worked in a number of bars before leaving for the UK. The mother of Vincent Le Berre, a French bar manager at Boro Bistro in Borough market, earlier told Le Telegramme that her son believed a colleague of his, Alexandre, had been killed at the bar.
Le Drian said on Monday he had wanted to come to London �쐔o show that France is at Britain�셲 side. �쏷he UK has been hit for the third time in less than three months by a terrorist attack. We wanted to show our solidarity to all families of the victims and show we are all concerned by this, and to express our profound compassion.��
�쏛t present the the toll among French citizens of the London attack is two dead and eight injured, including four in a serious condition,�� the foreign ministry said. One French national �쐒emains missing��.Xavier Thomas�셲 next of kin have been informed that the body of a man was found in the river on Tuesday night at 7.44pm near Limehouse by specialist officers from the marine police unit.Thomas, who was in London for the weekend with his girlfriend, has not been seen since Saturday night. His girlfriend, Christine Delcros, was seriously injured. Her sister, Nathalie Cros Brohan, posted online that she was on her way to London to visit Delcros in hospital. She appealed for anyone with news of Thomas to get in touch, adding: �쏻e are terribly worried.��
Ignacio Echeverr챠a, 39, from Madrid, who works for HSBC in London, had apparently been skateboarding in a park with friends when he stopped to help a woman who was injured in the atrocity. His family had been asked for fingerprints for identification purposes.Australian Sara Zelenak, 21, was last seen running from the attack on London Bridge, where she became separated from friends. Her mother, Julie, who travelled to London, confirmed her death in a Facebook post saying: �쏶ara Zelenak is confirmed dead they found her body & has DNA tests confirmed thank-you for all the overwhelming love & support from everyone.�� Zelenak was a nanny, and was supposed to be babysitting on Saturday night but there was a last-minute change of plan.
Her mother told Australian radio station 97.3FM her daughter had been travelling in Europe since March, and was working as an au pair in London. She said her daughter had been at Westminster the day before Khalid Masood killed five in a car and knife rampage and had also planned to go to the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, where suicide bomber Salman Abedi murdered 22 victims. �쏣verything, she�셲 just missed,�� she had said.Among the 48 injured were four police officers, including a British Transport Police officer who confronted the terrorists with nothing more than a baton. Theresa May said many of the wounded had sustained life-threatening injuries, while the NHS said at least 21 people were in a critical condition.
The BTP chief constable, Paul Crowther, said he had visited his colleague in hospital and he had �쐓howed enormous courage in the face of danger, as did many others who were at the scene and rushed to help��.
�쏛lthough he is seriously unwell, he was able to recount how he faced the attackers armed only with his baton, outside London Bridge station. For an officer who only joined us less than two years ago, the bravery he showed was outstanding and makes me extremely proud,�� he said.
A Metropolitan police officer, a rugby player based in Southwark, was off duty and having a drink with friends when he was stabbed tackling one of the three attackers. He is in a serious condition. The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said: �쏮y understanding is that, without hesitation, wearing his normal clothes, he dived in and tried to assist, and he I�셫 afraid was himself severely injured, but utterly heroic.��
A further two Met officers were hurt while on duty, one a plain clothes officer who received stitches to a head injury, and a uniformed officer who received an injury to his arm.
Mark Rowley, the Met police assistant commissioner, said a member of the public was shot as officers tried to neutralise the terrorists with an �쐕nprecedented�� level of gunfire. Speaking at a press conference, Rowley said the individual was being treated in hospital but was not in a critical condition.
He said eight armed officers discharged about 50 bullets as they tried to stop the three knife-wielding attackers.
Dr Malik Ramadhan, a senior doctor at the Royal London hospital, told the Guardian the man was shot in the head but was expected to make a full recovery. �쏻e had one gunshot wound. There�셲 a patient in this hospital who�셲 been shot in the head; a man. He�셲 absolutely not dying. Our expectation is that he will make a full recovery,�� said Ramadhan, the divisional director for trauma at the hospital.
The mother of one of the victims, 23-year-old Daniel O�셄eill, has told of her son�셲 experience. �쏦e just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said �쁳his is for my family, this is for Islam��, and stuck a knife straight in him. He�셲 got a 7in scar going from his belly round to his back,�� Elizabeth O�셄eill told reporters outside King�셲 College hospital.
�쏷he man ran away, Daniel headed back into the pub, there were shots fired, everybody was told to lie down, and then they were told to go downstairs in the bar. At this stage, Daniel�셲 friend had put a tourniquet on him and was holding pressure there. He was brought downstairs �� parts of that he doesn�셳 remember �� and then the police were there and brought him in their car to the hospital.��
O�셄eill said her son could talk but was in shock. �쏷hese people say they are doing this in the name of God, which is an absolute joke. They are callous, they are barbaric and they are absolute cowards. We will carry on as normal,�� she said.
London hospitals, including King�셲 College hospital, the Royal London and St Thomas�셲 confirmed they were among those treating the injured, though a number had now been discharged.
Geoff Ho, the Sunday Express business editor, was taken to intensive care after being stabbed in the throat when he tried to help a wounded bouncer. He was filmed being led away from the scene by a police officer, clutching his neck and with his shirt off.
According to the Mirror, he wrote on Facebook: �쏡on�셳 know whether it was stupid or noble to jump in and break up the fight outside the Southwark Tavern, but two a***s trying to do over the lone bouncer on the door isn�셳 happening on my watch.��
His friend, Isabelle Oderberg, tweeted: �쏻e have found Geoff. He is in intensive care.�� She told the Melbourne newspaper the Age: �쏦e is actually a martial artist and I wouldn�셳 be surprised if he would have stood up and been counted because he�셲 just that type of person.��
From his hospital bed, Ho wrote: �쏷he bastard in the Arsenal shirt came at me first. I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat.��
Antonis Filis, a Greek national who works in London, is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the kidney. Greece�셲 state news agency said Filis, who also sustained head injuries, had been with his girlfriend in Borough Market.
According to Greek local media, Filis�셲 parents, Giorgos and Grazia-Maria, heard the news from his girlfriend. Filis lived close to Borough Market and his father sent a message to check that he was all right. �쏻e didn�셳 get an answer, and then a little while later we saw a call come in from his phone. A girl said: �쁃on�셳 worry, he is well, he has been injured,�쇺�� Giorgos Filis told Lamia Report, a news outlet in the central Greek town.
�쏧 wouldn�셳 wish it on any parent to be faced with the feeling that we had �� he stared at death in the face �� he said they were aiming for his carotid �� with God�셲 help and with him throwing up his hand [in front of his face], he was hit on the head. If it had been a little bit lower we don�셳 know what would have happened.��
Filis required eight stitches to his head and several hours of surgery after being knifed in the kidney. His father said he was now out of danger.
Brett Freeman, from Dagenham, east London, was stabbed four times according to friend Darren Mole. Mole tweeted:Mole posted a picture of Freeman in his hospital bed.
Kim del Toro, the mother of Candice Hedge from Australia who was named as one of those hurt in the attack, told Fairfax Media that her daughter had received emergency surgery at St Thomas�셲 hospital, and said: �쏶he is going to be fine, thank goodness.��
The Brisbane Courier Mail said Hedge had finished her waiting shift at Elliot�셲 restaurant and was having a drink at the bar when a man came up behind her, grabbed her head and slashed at her throat.
Del Toro said Hedge had been at the bar with her boyfriend, Luke, when �쐆e heard some commotion out the front and went out to see what was going on��.
�쏦e saw some men with knives coming toward them, and he ran back inside to see where Candice was.��
She said he had been unable to find her, and the police had yelled for everyone to stay down. He had then seen his girlfriend running towards him, holding her bleeding neck.
Del Toro said her daughter had been able to make a Skype call on Sunday morning. �쏶he couldn�셳 speak, but I got to see her and she gave me the thumbs up, so I knew that she was OK.��
Hedge also posted on Facebook to reassure friends, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She wrote: �쏧�셫 doing OK. Still in hospital, but all in the clear. I really can�셳 talk. The f----- stabbed me in the neck. Don�셳 worry too much. I love you all.��
In a video posted on Reddit, Morrison, from Darwin, Australia, who had a bloodstained cloth wrapped around his neck, said he had been stabbed after leaving Belushi�셲 bar where he had been watching the Champions League final.
�쏛ll of a sudden this guy comes up with a knife �� I push him off. I walk into a pub and say: �쁓omeone help me, I�셶e been stabbed,�쇺�� he said on the video.
Morrison�셲 sister Katrina told the NT News the family was just happy he was safe. �쏽es, my brother was involved,�� she said. �쏻e�셱e currently sorting out his flight home.��
Oliver Dowling, 32, from Christchurch, New Zealand, was recovering from four hours of surgery after being stabbed in the face, neck and stomach.
According to the New Zealand Herald, his sister Freddy posted on Facebook: �쏡octors are very happy with how he�셲 come out the other side. A massive thanks to the University of London hospital for their tireless efforts in helping my brother out!��
His girlfriend, Marie Bondeville, was also injured, she wrote, adding: �쏮arie has been in surgery at another hospital but unfortunately we haven�셳 been able to find out how she is due to not being immediate family.��
Larner, 47, from Peckham, was stabbed eight times as he fought with the trio of attackers at the Black & Blue bar in Borough Market. They shouted: �쏷his is for Allah�� and �쏧slam, Islam, Islam,�� he told the Sun. He said he shouted back: �쏤uck you, I�셫 Millwall,�� before trying to punch them.
A spokesman for Spain�셲 foreign ministry told the Associated Press that a Spanish man had been treated in hospital for wounds described as not serious.
Two German nationals were among the injured, according to Germany�셲 interior ministry.
Six women and eight men were taken to King�셲 College hospital in south London and one patient had since been discharged, a spokesman said. The Royal London hospital in east London was continuing to treat 12 people, Barts health NHS trust said.
A spokeswoman for Guy�셲 and St Thomas�셲 NHS foundation trust said it had treated nine patients at St Thomas�셲 �� six men and three women. Five had since been discharged and four �� two men and two women �� had been admitted.
A rest centre was set up at London South Bank University where volunteers from the British Red Cross were helping those affected, Southwark council said.
Of the 48 people admitted to five London hospitals following the attack, 32 still remained, NHS England said on Tuesday. The number of those in a critical condition fell to 15 from 18 on Monday, and 21 initially.
Many of us rightly feel distress and moral outrage at the attack in London, leaving some innocent people dead, some with horrific injuries. That feeling is only human. Such deaths and injuries, much magnified, occur more or less daily in, for example, Syria, Yemen and Iraq �� yet receive proportionately far less distress and outrage from us. That too seems to be human. Ought not that discrepancy to cause us some moral unease? Or does that question�셲 implication suggest a silly �쐁itizen of the world�� attitude which Theresa May rejects as being a citizen of nowhere?

�� �쏧t is not an act of war,�� you say in your editorial (23 March). Exactly. It was a disastrous error of judgment when the �쐗ar against terror�� was declared. Until that point all governments had insisted acts of terror were criminal acts. Calling them acts of war helps to glorify the unjust, and lends unwarranted dignity to cowardly and pointless slaughter.

�� Simon Jenkins continues to profess bafflement at the motivation of Islamic terrorists (This attack is a tragedy but not a threat to democracy, 23 March). If he really wants to understand it, all he has to do is read any of the many websites run by imams and devoted to Islamic theological education. He will find there is an Islamic doctrine, �쐏unishment of the grave��, which condemns even rather pious Muslims to horrible torments between their death and judgment day, in retribution for misdemeanours as trivial as splashing their clothes with urine while using the lavatory.
Imagine the effect on the mental health of Muslims who know themselves guilty of much worse offences. Suicide bombers often turn out to have been far from devout. Ironically enough, that is often advanced as evidence that their crime had �쐍othing to do with religion��. To them, martyrdom �� the killing of unbelievers �� offers a free pass to paradise, escaping all the judgment formalities.
In spite of direct declarations by aspiring bombers themselves and their proud relatives, we western liberals seem to have great difficulty in accepting that some Muslims really believe this, and indeed act on it.

�� Simon Jenkins is correct in his analysis of the publicity given so generously by media and public figures in the aftermath of Wednesday�셲 lone attack in Westminster. It was certainly not, in the prime minister�셲 words to parliament, an attempt to �쐓ilence our democracy��. On the contrary, these acts are intended to broadcast and expand their recruitment from among us. The terror they intend to provoke is not primarily aimed at us, the west, democracies, our freedoms etc. There is no realistic aspiration to create a �쐁aliphate�� in London, or anywhere else in Europe.
The terror Isis wants to provoke is in the fractured states of the Middle East and north Africa, where many tens of thousands have been killed or subjected to their appalling abuse. For that they need recruits, and long experience, dating back to the anarchists of the 1900s, has shown the best recruiting sergeants to be the amplification of their atrocities by the public reaction to them in the west. No one can condone such attacks, and the immediate victims deserve our unqualified support. But we undermine that support, and encourage yet more atrocities, when we provide the perpetrators with a megaphone for their crimes.

�� We unreservedly condemn the heinous terrorist attack on our symbol of democracy. Britain has always personified social justice, inclusion, multiculturalism and humanitarianism. The picture of healthcare workers rushing to help even the criminal who perpetrated this evil act is proof of our noble principles. Terrorism has no religion, colour, creed or caste. It is vital to remain vigilant and not rush to condemn the beautiful religion of Islam that enjoins its faithfuls to espouse tolerance, compassion, mercy, mutual respect, justice and peace. Also, urban planning must take into consideration the myriad challenges of public safety, security in the face of international extremism, radicalism and terrorism. Pavements meant for pedestrians should be protected by concrete blocks containing aesthetic flowers. This could act as a deterrent of future terrorist acts. Last but not least, our message is clear: we will never cower before evil.

�� Politicians speak of us being united in혻wishing to keep the values of the British way of life, yet we now have the most divided forms of educating our children. How can free schools, for instance, fit in with this shared unity? Our taxes are supporting diversity, not cohesion. If groups of any persuasion wish to promulgate their dogmas they should pay for it themselves and have their activities closely monitored.

Extremists acting on their own to carry out so-called �쐋one wolf�� terrorist attacks are difficult to predict and extremely hard to stop, an expert has warned in the wake of a knife assault on the London underground.
Dr Paul Gill, an academic who has studied over 100 �쐋one actor�� terrorists, issued the stark warning after police said they believed the 29-year-old man who allegedly staged a terrorist attack at Leytonstone tube station on Saturday evening was acting alone.
Gill, a lecturer in security and crime science at University College London who has worked with US counter-terrorism officials, said: �쏧t is very low-tech, low-capability and hard to detect ahead of time. Shouting �쁔his is for Syria��, stabbing people is worrying as it is easy to do.��
Online jihadi propaganda, most prominently in Inspire magazine, has for years urged extremists to carry out whatever attacks they can, no matter how low-tech.
Gill said: �쏷he thing to remember is that no matter how crazy and illogical a single act of violence appears at first glance, there is usually some rationality on the offenders�� half. At the very basic level, they are trying to effect some form of political change. Some perpetrators believe that this can only be achieved by killing as many people as possible.��
In the Leytonstone station attack, the suspect was allegedly shouting about Syria, which the UK House of Commons this week authorised British forces to bomb to try to tackle the Islamic State terrorist group.
Gill�셲 work included a study for the US Department of Homeland Security, in which 119 lone actor terrorists were examined. Lone actors carry out attacks not just in the name of Islamism, but also influenced by extreme rightwing ideology as well as anti-abortion views, and environmentalism.
Research by Gill and other academics found there may be clues ahead of an attack by a single individual. It says: �쏤or a large majority (83%) of offenders, others were aware of the grievances that later spurred their terrorist plots or actions. In a similar number of cases (79%), others were aware of the individual�셲 commitment to a specific extremist ideology.��
So-called lone wolves are not just driven to violence by an ideological cause, said Gill, who added: �쏰ne-third had have mental health problems and others had other stressors such as having lost their job. The ideology gives them a buffer from their other problems.��
Talking about the Leytonstone attack, the academic said: �쓂as this a vulnerable person, who was going to act violently anyway?��
Lone actors are those outside of a terrorist network, and the UK has seen such attacks before. Roshonara Choudhry tried to assassinate the Labour MP Stephen Timms in 2010 as punishment for his support for the Iraq war. She radicalised herself and wanted to die as a martyr after watching more than 100 hours of video sermons from the extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki that she had found surfing the internet. Previously she had been a gifted student with no sign of criminality or extremism.
Britain�셲 terrorist threat level remained unchanged on Sunday after the attack at Leytonstone underground station. It has been at severe since 2014, meaning an attack is �쐆ighly likely��. The next level �� the highest �� would mean counter-terrorism analysts believe an attack is imminent.
The biggest threat comes from Isis, which has proven capable of inspiring or staging attacks around the world. After the Paris gun and bomb attacks three weeks ago, which killed 130 people, UK officials feared a new chapter in terrorist tactics.
Isis propaganda has led officials to fear lone-wolf attacks, possibly leading to small levels of death or injury, but the multiple and near-simultaneous Paris attacks resulted from large-scale planning designed to execute a terrorist spectacular.
After Paris, security officials in western countries that fear attack by Isis or its followers, including the US and UK, reviewed terrorism suspects to see if they had underestimated the level of danger they pose.
Because there are more suspects than resources to fully monitor them, security agencies rank them according to the danger they are feared to pose and then deploy assets accordingly. The most dangerous will be monitored 24/7.
The threat of international terrorism to the UK was raised from substantial to the second highest level of severe last night, meaning an attack is "highly likely".
Alan Johnson, the home secretary, said there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent.
The escalation reversed a decision in July to downgrade the likelihood of a terror attack from "severe" to "substantial".
Johnson said the change was not 짯specifically linked to the increased threat from international terrorism following the failed Detroit plane bombing on Christmas Day or to any other incident.
He said the Joint Terrorism 짯Analysis Centre (Jtac), a unit within MI5, had taken the 짯decision based on a broad range of 짯factors, 짯including the intent and 짯capabilities of international terrorist groups in the UK and overseas.
Johnson said: "We still face a real and serious threat to the UK from 짯international terrorism, so I would urge the public to remain vigilant and carry on 짯reporting 짯suspicious events to the appropriate authorities, and to support the police and security services in their 짯continuing efforts to discover, track and disrupt 짯terrorist activity."
He said the public should be reassured by the UK's "very adept and very focused counter-terrorism" services.
The terrorist threat has been at 짯substantial, meaning an attack is a "strong possibility", since July.
There are five 짯levels of terror threat, ranging from low �� meaning an attack is unlikely �� to critical, when an attack is expected imminently.
More security measures have been taken to protect airports since the failed Detroit attack. On Wednesday, Gordon Brown announced fresh measures to track terror suspects and improve airport security, including a suspension of direct flights between Yemen and the UK and a "no-fly list" to stop suspected terrorists from travelling to the UK.
A senior Whitehall security source said Jtac had assessed events, 짯including the Christmas Day bombing attempt and an 짯international counter-terrorism meeting on Yemen in London on Thursday, which will be held alongside a conference on the future of Afghanistan.
The source added other factors which could not be discussed were also part of Jtac's decision.
Security officials have no knowledge of a direct plot threat. The senior source said: "It is not based on a single piece of evidence or event. There is no knowledge of a new plot or an old plot moving on." Officials do not believe there will be a need to make arrests in the next 24 hours.
The source added that a whole series of events and pieces of intelligence 짯stretching across continents had led to the decision: "Yemen is a part of it, events in London are a part of it. There is no specific threat to London."
Sources with knowledge of the discussions before the decision said the mood among security officials was sober and they had not been as worried as they had been during recent terrorist crises, such as the disrupted 2006 plot to smuggle liquid bombs aboard planes.
Johnson briefed Janet Napolitano, the US homeland security secretary, about the development, which brings the UK on to a similar level of alert to the US.
Terrorism expert Professor Paul 짯Wilkinson, of the University of St Andrews, said raising the terror threat level was mainly designed to increase the vigilance of the emergency services and those working in security jobs. "I think it's not something that the public will notice very much, in terms of everyday life," he said.
Three different attacks, one overall suspect. The wave of killing on Friday will undoubtedly be attributed to Islamic State, which has already reportedly claimed responsibility for one amongst them, with strong indications of a role in the others.
Each attack hit a different target in a different way, and underlines the varied nature of a constantly evolving threat.
One involved Muslims killing Muslims in the Middle East itself: a bomb in a Shia mosque in Kuwait, a conservative Gulf state with a Sunni Muslim majority. This is part of the horrendous sectarian violence which has increasingly convulsed the region over the last five years and shows no sign of abating.
Outright war against Shias �� seen as apostates by Islamic State �� is a core aim of the terrorist organisation which goes back to its origins in Iraq a decade or more ago. This is a reminder that the vast proportion of casualties of terrorism are Muslims killed by co-religionists.
The second targeted western tourists in Tunisia. Hotels and holidaymakers have been a frequent target in recent years. Western tourists are both an obvious and vulnerable presence in the Islamic world. An attack on a hotel will attract global attention, mark a group�셲 influence and badly damage the local tourist industry.
Historically such attacks have undermined local support but it seems unlikely Friday�셲 attackers would have been bothered by this. The prime suspects for the Sousse attack are militants belonging to fragmented local groups, possibly based in neighbouring Libya and loyal to Isis.
Third was the attack on a US-owned gas cylinder plant in south-east France. The culprit in this strike appears to have worked for the victim�셲 company, but the French have nevertheless launched a terror investigation. He also appears to fit a profile that has become well established in recent years: a French male aged between 22 and 35 who was either born overseas before coming to France or whose parents migrated from Algeria or Morocco.
Some of these attackers have had links to overseas groups; while others have been closer to the classic idea of �쐋one wolves��. But all have been steeped in a broader environment of violent activism, extreme conservatism, homophobia and anti-semitism for many years before they acted.
They are �쐋one actors�� only in terms of the actual organisation and execution of a terrorist attack; their world view is shared by a significant number of people.
An increasing number have either been inspired by, or actually fought for, Islamic State. When propagandists of the group tell individuals their duty is to take up arms in European countries �� especially against the �쐄ilthy French�� �� they know already how receptive some will be to their call to arms.
The three strikes came almost exactly on the first anniversary of Islamic State�셲 declaration of its caliphate, and it is possible they were coordinated. If so, it would indicate a new level of strategic thinking and capability for Isis. If not, they nevertheless send a potent message: terrorists hope to to give the impression that they can strike at will, everywhere, anywhere.
This is clearly not the case: the attack in Europe involved one man; the one in Tunis, a gunman or two. We are still far from the mass casualty attacks of 10 or 12 years ago in Europe. We are also far from the doomsday scenario of highly trained Isis militants making their way to the UK, US or wherever to execute major operations.
But the sense of ubiquitous menace inevitably induced by Friday�셲 killings will be difficult to dispel.
The names of the 86 victims who died in the 14 July attack in the French city of Nice have been read aloud, and a white rose for each has been pinned to a monument, at a national ceremony marking three months since the killings.
Tunisian-born Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a 19-ton truck along the beach front, mowing down people who had gathered to watch the fireworks on Bastille Day, before police shot him dead.
�쏷hree months ago here, on our national day ... it was supposed to be joyous. It became hell. In four minutes, just four minutes, a truck at high speed transformed the Promenade des Anglais into a cemetery,�� the French president, Fran챌ois Hollande said.
The ceremony was attended by survivors, victims�� families and French political leaders from the government and opposition. �쏻e have listened to the names of the 86 people whose lives were suddenly interrupted,�� Hollande said, adding that the oldest was a 92-year-old Italian who died with his partner and two friends. The youngest was just over two years old, and from Nice. She died alongside her cousin, her grandmother and a friend, he said.
Hollande said France, which is engaged in the fight against radical Islamist militancy in the Middle East and North Africa, would not back down despite several attacks on French soil aimed at creating divisions and stigmatisation.
�쏻hat was struck on 14 July was national unity. It is the monstrous aim of the terrorists: attack some to scare others and unleash violence to create divisions,�� Hollande said. �쏷his evil enterprise will fail. Unity, freedom and humanity will ultimately prevail.��
Three would-be suicide bombers face life in jail after a jury convicted them on Thursday of plotting to carry out terror attacks in the UK which would have been more deadly than the 7/7 bombings in 2005.
The men from Birmingham are the latest group of British-based extremists to be radicalised by the preachings of the now-dead Anwar al-Awlaki, the one-time leader of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.
His extremist message continues to be spread from beyond the grave through the English language terror manual he created, Inspire magazine, which is still disseminated via internet forums despite robust attempts by the security services in the UK and abroad to stop it. Videos of sermons by Awlaki were still available late Thursday on YouTube.
The men's plans to create their own 9/11 by making bombs from sports injury cold pack treatments were thwarted by the biggest counter-terror operation mounted in the UK for seven years, which at times involved more than 400 officers and agents.
Convicted on Thursday by a jury at Woolwich crown court, London, of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist attacks, the three were key figures in a terror cell in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham. They aimed to detonate eight to 10 suicide bombs and timed explosive devices that prosecutors said could have caused "death and injury on a massive scale". Six other members of the cell had earlier pleaded guilty.
The ringleaders, chemistry graduate Irfan Naseer, 31, and Irfan Khalid, 27, both from Sparkhill had travelled to Pakistan twice for training �� on the second occasion spending two months at an al-Qaida training facility in Miran Shah, in north Waziristan, where they had to flee from American drone strikes. They recruited Ashik Ali, 27, from Balsall Heath in Birmingham, on their return, and began to draw others into the plot.
They duped members of the public into donating thousands of pounds to fund their terror plot by posing as collectors for the charity Muslim Aid in Sparkhill. Within two weeks they raised 짙14,500, which they diverted to fund their activities.
Police in the West Midlands defended the reach of the government's multimillion pound anti-terror strategy, Prevent, at the conclusion of the trial. Despite millions of pounds being spent in the Sparkhill area relatives and friends of some of those involved who became suspicious chose to take action themselves rather than pass information to the police.
Mr Justice Henriques told the guilty men it was clear they were planning to carry out a spectacular bombing campaign and that they would all face life in prison when they are sentenced in April or May. Speaking to Naseer, the judge said he had been convicted on "overwhelming evidence" and that he would face "a very long minimum term".
He said: "You are a highly skilled bomb maker and explosives expert. Your mindset was similarly manifest. You were seeking to recruit a team of somewhere between six and eight suicide bombers to carry out a spectacular bombing campaign, one which would create an anniversary along the lines of 7/7 or 9/11."
Khalid he said was was "very much his (Naseer's) confidant and his right-hand man."
Of Ali, the judge said he "intelligent, devious and highly manipulative."
Marcus Beale, assistant commissioner of West Midlands police, who worked with the security services to intercept the plot, said: "This group was critical of the 7 July bombers because they didn't kill enough people. If they delivered on the plans that they had they would have committed mass murder on a horrendous scale."
However, there was evidence that the men were struggling to get the ingredients for their plot and no targets were identified by the police or security services. When arrested they were found in possession of just one sports cold pack kit which did not contain the key ingredient for the bombs, ammonium nitrate, because the substance is no longer used in the products.
Beale defended the role of Prevent. Relatives and friends were aware that four followers of Naseer, Khalid and Ali had travelled to train in Pakistan in 2011, but instead of contacting the police they successfully used their own contacts in the country to get the men to return home.
Beale said: "It would be fantastic if more information would come from the community. But if my child was going off the rails I would definitely be wanting to help them myself first rather than go the police and any parent would want to do the same so I would not want to be critical."
Naseer and Khalid built their plot on their return from the training camp in Miran Shah, in the summer of 2011. They shared their knowledge of bomb making with Ali, who rented a council flat which became a makeshift bomb factory and the hub of the plot. Experts told the court they could have created a viable device.
But unknown to the men they were being watched by the police and security services who had placed bugs in two cars and the bomb factory which picked up the plot being described as another 9/11.
At one point the three men were heard driving in a car mimicking Formula One commentator Murray Walker, and joking: "It's the four suicide bombers driving around ready to take on England."
Khalid also said of the plot: "This is going to kick them all, the [infidels] that go to the pub and that; they have hit us in our own country, my God they hit us."
Naseer was found guilty of five counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist attacks, Khalid of four and Ali of three counts �� all between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September 2011.
They are the latest group of British-based extremists to take their inspiration from American-born Awlaki, the Yemen-based cleric who was a leader of AQAP until he was killed by a US drone in September 2011.
Other extremists who have used his sermons and Inspire magazine to self-radicalise include Roshonara Choudhry, who attacked the MP Stephen Timms, and four terrorists from Birmingham who were convicted in 2012 of plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange. A search of Ali's house after his arrest uncovered a vast library of lectures by Awlaki.
One of the plans discussed by the three �� of attaching blades to the wheels of cars in order to mow down pedestrians �� came directly from Inspire, the second edition of which describes how to create "the ultimate mowing machine".
Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism in the CPS, said: "A considerable number of investigations have uncovered connection to and support for the teachings of �� Awlaki...his pernicious and hateful views unfortunately live on in his recorded speeches and Inspire magazine."
Keith Vaz MP, chair of the home affairs committee, criticised YouTube over Awlaki material being on the site. "Youtube should not be hosting this material. Material which incites violent radicalism should not be on Youtube. They should be much more proactive in taking it down without waiting for complaints."
Azad Ali, chair of the Muslim Safety Forum which has worked with the police to combat Jihadi violence, said that if Awlaki material was found in a book shop a proseuction wouldme made, saying: "Youtube is hosting the same material and there seems to be no action taken against it at all..
YouTube said: "YouTube has Community Guidelines that prohibit dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech, and incitement to commit violent acts, and we take violations of these guidelines seriously. Our review teams respond to flagged videos around the clock, routinely removing material under those policies. Our flagging tools include a flag labeled "promotes terrorism" to make it easier for our users to identify content that incites violence."
A British national of Somali origin was being questioned in the Netherlands today after he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in terrorism. He was held at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam after flying in from Liverpool on his way to Uganda.
Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5, warned last week of a growing number of British nationals going to Somalia to train and fight. They mainly travel via Kenya, Dubai or Yemen, though there is growing evidence they are now going through Uganda, counterterrorism officials suggest.
It is not believed that the arrested man was involved in a plot in Britain, but Evert Boersma, from the Dutch prosecutors' office, said the arrest followed a tip-off from British authorities. He said the man was suspected of possible involvement with a foreign terrorist organisation, but did not specify which.
The man flew in on Sunday morning on a KLM flight, Boersma said. "He had already boarded his connecting flight for Uganda when he was arrested." Another spokesman for the Dutch prosecutors' office said: "The man was en route from Liverpool to Entebbe in Uganda when he was arrested. The possible involvement of this man with a foreign terroristic organisation is being investigated."
Security at Schiphol has been tightened since last Christmas Day, when it was the departure point for a Nigerian student, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, accused of trying to blow up a plane over Detroit by setting off explosives hidden in his underwear. He was tackled by passengers and crew, and is now charged in the US with attempting to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 with 278 passengers and 11 crew members aboard.
Last month, two Yemeni men were arrested at the Amsterdam airport after flying in from Chicago, on suspicion they may have been conducting a dry run for an airline terror attack. The two were held for several days then released after an investigation turned up no evidence to link them to a terror plot.
The Somalia-based Islamist militia al-Shabaab claimed responsiblity for a suicide attack on people watching the World Cup final on TV in Entebbe, the Ugandan capital. It said it was revenge for the presence of Ugandan troops in the African Union peacekeeping force backing the Somali government against the militia.
Just before his torturers pushed him out of the van, barely conscious, on to the Nairobi pavement, Abdi was told he was one of the lucky ones: �쏽ou were supposed to die tonight.��
The security operatives who picked him up were Kenyan, but new research from the Angaza Foundation for African Reporting suggests they are part of a US-funded counter-terrorism strategy across Africa that is leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
Since Kenya invaded Somalia in 2011 in an effort to dislodge the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, thousands of ethnic Somalis like Abdi living in Kenya have been detained, many on dubious grounds.
The security forces, in particular the Kenyan Defence Force, which continues to receive significant US funding, and the anti-terrorism police unit, have been accused of torture and summary executions.
Though the nature of Abdi�셲 account makes it difficult to independently verify, the details are similar to those of other accounts collected by local NGOs, including the Independent Medico-Legal Unit, which documents incidents of torture and political violence in Kenya.
Abdi said he was walking out of the university where he studied in 2015 when a car, modified to operate as a mobile torture unit, pulled up next to him, and a gun with a silencer was pointed at his face.
As Abdi was restrained he was told by men who identified themselves as police that he had been under surveillance for years. His interrogators were suspicious because he was living in a house outside Eastleigh, Nairobi�셲 predominantly Somali suburb. They kept asking: �쏛re you trying to recruit for al-Shabaab?��
Whenever they did not like an answer they shocked him with an industrial cattle prod, he says, estimating that the whole ordeal lasted for seven hours.
Abdi now suffers chronic back pain from the shocks. But still, he considers himself one of the lucky ones. �쏰ut of 10 [people] taken, maybe one comes back,�� he says.
Dr Abdallah Waititu was less fortunate. He left work on the afternoon of 4 April last year and has not been seen since. The 33-year-old pharmacist of Somali origin, known as Duktur (doctor), was a pillar of the Eastleigh community until he vanished.
�쏰ur friends tell us not to worry, that he�셲 still alive. But I can�셳 believe it until I see him,�� said his brother Imran. For Waititu�셲 grieving family, life has changed drastically. His three wives and five young children have had to move into a smaller apartment, and his brothers work overtime to cover rent and food. Every week, they do the rounds of local police stations and morgues.
The family are also trying to sue the government to get it to reveal where Waitutu is. The government says it does not know.
In June, Abdul Mwangi Karuri, another senior figure at the mosque and a budding politician, also disappeared. His colleagues at the Democratic party blame the authorities. Kenyan officials, including the National Counter-terrorism Centre, did not respond to repeated requests to comment on either case.
Stories of intimidation, arrests, torture and disappearances have become the norm in Eastleigh, but Imran believes �쏫enya is just doing this to please the outside world. Every abduction is proof to donors that their money is being spent��, he said.
For years the US has propped up some of the worst human rights violators on the continent, a trend that experts warn may get worse under President Donald Trump, who has reiterated his support for torture against terror suspects, and has already started making good on his campaign promises to aggressively crack down on terror groups.
Examples of the tension between fighting terror and protecting human rights span the continent: in Nigeria, the US is spending $40m to fight Boko Haram, despite the State Department�셲 own findings that Nigeria�셲 �쐓ecurity services perpetrated extrajudicial killings, and engaged in torture [and] rape��.
In South Sudan, US funding before the outbreak of civil war in 2013 helped to train and modernise the national army, despite the widespread use of child soldiers.
There is also the Trans-Saharan Counter-terrorism Partnership, a flagship initiative that since 2005 has given between $90m and $160m from the US government a year to security forces and judicial services across 10 countries in the Sahel and Maghreb: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia �� many with dubious respect for democracy and freedom.
Kenya is a particularly striking example of this schism. In 2016 the US gave $120m worth of support to the Kenyan military and $8m to the police. The same year, Human Rights Watch documented 34 enforced disappearances in Nairobi and north-east Kenya linked to counter-terrorism operations.
Constitutionally, the US is not supposed to fund human rights abusers. According to the Leahy law, pushed through by the senator Patrick Leahy in the late 1990s, �쐍o assistance shall be furnished �� to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the secretary of state has credible information that such unit has committed a gross violation of human rights��.
The wording is the downfall. By specifying assistance by unit it presumes that the good cops can be separated, and funded separately, from bad cops. Human Rights Watch says this loophole is being exploited in countries such as Kenya. Requests for specific information about how the US funds Kenya�셲 security services were made to the Department of State, Department of Defence, and the US embassy in Kenya, but were all rebuffed or ignored.
The US Africa Command, responsible for military relations on the continent, said that �쐄unding assistance is generally denied in those cases where there is determined to be credible information that such members or units of a foreign security force have committed a gross violation of human rights��.
Meanwhile, it is unclear whether the �쐗ar on terror�� in Africa is working. Attacks have quadrupled since 2009, and fatalities are up by 850%. While the collapse of Libya has played a major role in the sharp rise in numbers, as has the expansion of Islamic State, failings by national security agencies may also shoulder some blame.
In 2014 the Institute for Security Studies spoke to 95 members of militant Islamist groups in Kenya to ask why they had become radicalised.
The majority of members, from al-Shabaab and the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC), �쐒eferred to injustices at the hands of Kenyan security forces��, explains Anneli Botha, the researcher on the project.
Some complained that �쏿ll Muslims are treated as terrorists��, while others pointed to specific failings by the Kenyan police.
A year after his interrogation Abdi says he no longer walks around in fear, but feels angry and betrayed. �쏷he people I�셫 supposed to run to for protection, they are the ones attacking me. They are supposed to fight terror, but they are the terrorists,�� he says.

Scores of imprisoned Turkish journalists face a Kafkaesque nightmare of legal limbo, farcical charge sheets, maltreatment and even solitary confinement in the country that locks up more reporters than any other in the world.
A series of Guardian interviews and written exchanges with several of those jailed as a result of a sweeping media crackdown found a huge mental burden on the incarcerated, as well as tough social and intellectual restrictions.
�쏧 have been broken and twisted in more ways than I can imagine,�� says the recently released novelist Asl캇 Erdo휓an (no relation to the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an), who spent five days in solitary confinement at the start of four months of pretrial detention.
Mehmet Altan, a journalist awaiting trial for supposedly attempting to bring down the government describes his life in prison as an environment �쐗here no needs of a mature mind are met. It is like wearing striped pyjamas. It is a very narrow life without any joy or feeling to it.��
�쏯ever have I seen this much wrongdoing,�� said Bar캇힊 Yarkada힊, an MP in the opposition Republican People�셲 party (CHP) and a member of the media commission that monitors journalists�� arrests and provides them with legal aid.
The media crackdown followed a coup attempt last July that left more than 200 people dead and more than 1,400 injured.
The purges have led to tens of thousands of civil servants, members of the police, military and judiciary as well as academics and journalists being either detained or dismissed for alleged links to the network of Fethullah G체len, an exiled preacher blamed for instigating the coup.
Opponents of President Erdo휓an say the purges have turned into a witch-hunt against dissidents in government, academia and the media, to stifle them before a historic referendum in April that would grant sweeping powers to the president.
The CHP says 152 journalists are behind bars and 173 media outlets have been shut since the coup attempt, including newspapers, magazines, radio stations, websites and news agencies. More than 2,500 journalists have been laid off because of the closures and 800 have had their press cards revoked, with many also having their passports confiscated.
The government only acknowledges that 30 journalists are in prison.In November, a dozen journalists at Cumhuriyet, Turkey�셲 oldest newspaper and a bastion of opposition to Erdo휓an, were arrested and most have remained in custody without formal indictments. The government has threatened to appoint a trustee board to manage the publication�셲 affairs in a move that would silence its critics.
Many Kurdish outlets have been shut and often recreated under different names after accusations of propaganda on behalf of the PKK. Kurdish journalists have been repeatedly arrested while reporting on demonstrations against the government, only to be quickly released after one hearing, in a practice seen as an attempt to intimidate them.
Last month Deniz Y체cel, a German-Turkish journalist who works for Die Welt newspaper, was formally arrested because of his reporting on the hacking of the personal emails of Berat Albayrak, the energy minister and Erdo휓an�셲 son-in-law.
�쏷urkey now has the dubious honour of being the world�셲 biggest jailer of journalists, and free media in the country is in its death throes,�� Amnesty International said after Yucel�셲 arrest.
Ayd캇n Do휓an, head of the Do휓an Group, which publishes one of the country�셲 leading newspapers, the H체rriyet, was recently summoned to court after an article published by the paper indicated there was discomfort in the military about what was happening politically �� a move interpreted as a call for the military to intervene in politics.
Some observers have described the accusations levelled against some leading journalists as bizarre. Ahmet 힇ik, an investigative journalist who is in prison, was accused of propaganda on behalf of the G체len network, even though he authored a book called The Imam�셲 Army that exposed the group�셲 corrupt practices.
�쏧t�셲 a bit like arresting Martin Luther King for being a member of the Klan,�� said one rights worker.
Cumhuriyet has also often reported on the damaging influence of the G체lenists, who once shared power with the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). When the director of the newspaper�셲 board, Ak캇n Atalay, returned from overseas to challenge the order for his arrest he was detained because investigators determined he was a flight risk.
�쏻e all know this is absurdity,�� said Yarkada힊, the CHP lawmaker who recently visited the Cumhuriyet journalists in prison. �쏷his is not rule of law. This is undermining the law.
�쏷he government is saying if you oppose the regime we are planning to plant in Turkey, you will find yourself in prison and we will isolate you from the outside world.��
Media outlets also face financial pressures. Monitors say the government is leaning on businesses to avoid advertising in opposition newspapers in order to curtail their revenues.
The result has been that the vast majority of mainstream outlets are either openly supportive of the AKP government or are mildly centrist in their politics. The only major opposition outlets are Cumhuriyet and Halk TV, a station close to the CHP, and S철zc체, a tabloid similar to the Sun in the UK.
Opposition officials say the oppressive media environment has limited the debate around the referendum and masked many problems in the country, including a worsening economic crisis, high youth unemployment, spiralling tensions with the PKK, terrorism and foreign policy woes. They say the stifling of discussion on these issues has been to Turkey�셲 detriment.
But from the government�셲 perspective, the rights worker argued, consolidating control over the media allows it to sway the 10% of undecided voters who could swing the result of the April referendum.
For many campaigning for press freedoms, the media crackdown is ironic because of their role in defeating the coup attempt last July.
Erdo휓an was only able to appeal to Turkish citizens to go out on the streets through the iPhone of a reporter, who held up the president�셲 image on the FaceTime app to the camera and broadcast his appeal to millions of viewers who answered the call.
�쏡emocracy means plurality,�� said Yarkada힊. �쏷he concept of plurality is being abolished with these actions against newspapers, and Turkey is being put in a position where there is only one voice.��
Theresa May accuses Jeremy Corbyn of saying that terror attacks in the UK is the country�셲 own fault in the aftermath of the Manchester attack. Speaking at the G7 summit in Sicily on Friday, she says �쁳here can be no excuse for what happened��
Amid the storm over Jamal al-Harith, who was paid 짙1m compensation by the government following his incarceration in Guant찼namo Bay and has now been identified as an Islamic State suicide bomber, we should remind ourselves why he received the settlement. Like hundreds of men he was held in extrajudicial detention for years and subjected to torture on a regular basis, with the complicity of the UK. He was taken to Camp X-Ray because the US thought he might have useful information on the treatment of prisoners by the Taliban �� who had held him as a suspected British spy �� not because he was considered dangerous. Authorities concluded he had no links to the Taliban or al-Qaida, though they thought some questions remained. Very few of the detainees have ever faced any charges even in the unsatisfactory forum of Guant찼namo�셲 military tribunals, substandard courts lacking basic due-process protections. Most have been released and returned to society.
We have no way of knowing whether the trauma of his treatment accounted for Harith�셲 recruitment by Isis, or whether he was set on this path anyway. That is, in any case, secondary. What critics of the payment are actually saying is that anyone suspected of possible involvement in or interest in committing an offence has no right to the presumption of innocence. Regardless of how unsatisfactory the evidence against them is, the suspicion is enough to deny them the basic protections of international law and human dignity, and even the most serious and shocking infringements of those rights should receive no redress.
The claim that Harith was paid compensation to prevent revelations endangering national security in the courtroom is unconvincing: lawyers argue that a public interest immunity could have covered this. The settlement saved the government from embarrassing revelations about its acquiescence in and enabling of the torture of one of its own citizens, and from a larger bill from protracted proceedings which he was likely to win.
In a narrow sense, the payments to Britons who had been held at Guant찼namo were redress for the damage to the rights of Harith and other former detainees. But in a broader sense, they were an attempt to repair the damage done to Britain. We undermine the very things we purport to be defending in the fight against terrorism if we downgrade the rule of law and protection of human rights. And we damage ourselves doubly, because we lose hearts and minds when others see that hypocrisy.
This is not a historical argument, even if some people are busier rehashing political battles over Harith�셲 case than considering what we can learn from it. For the UK one obvious and important question is, given the monitoring of the British detainees after their release, how he was able to leave the country and travel to Syria in 2014.
In the US, President Trump has turned his back on Barack Obama�셲 failed ambitions to close Guant찼namo Bay; as a candidate he vowed to �쐋oad it up�� with Isis and other terrorist suspects, and called for the reinstatement of waterboarding and �쏿 hell of a lot worse��. Pressure from defence secretary James Mattis (and CIA director Mike Pompeo) appears to have fought off plans for a policy review on reviving torture tactics and the appointment of HR McMaster as national security adviser is encouraging: as a commander in Iraq, he stressed humane treatment of detainees. Neither of these military men are bleeding-heart liberals; they recognise mistreatment is both wrong in principle, and counterproductive in practice.
But the pending executive order on detention and interrogation is highly likely to expand the use of Guant찼namo, precisely to deny detainees the rights they would otherwise have. That too would be wrong. The lesson from Harith�셲 case is to be more not less scrupulous in our treatment of terrorism suspects.
A memorial to the victims of terrorism has been unveiled in Brussels on the first anniversary of the attacks that killed 32 people and injured more than 320.
In a speech at the inauguration ceremony in the Belgian capital�셲 European quarter, King Philippe urged citizens to listen to each other and draw lessons from the attack.
�쏧t�셲 the responsibility of each and every one of us to make our society more humane, and more just. Let�셲 learn to listen to each other again, to respect each other�셲 weaknesses,�� he said. �쏛bove all, let us dare to be tender.��
The memorial sculpture, called �쏻ounded but still standing in the face of the unthinkable��, is 20 metres long and 2 metres high and takes the form of a pair of stainless steel slabs bending to the sky in a gesture of hope.
The Brussels-born sculptor Jean-Henri Comp챔re said he wanted the work to evoke hope and pay tribute to public resilience in the face of the attacks.
The monument is dedicated to the victims of terrorist attacks in Brussels, but also those who lost their lives or suffered injuries in recent attacks in France, Tunisia and Turkey.
The ceremony was also attended by Queen Mathilde, as well as some of the survivors and victims�� families.
Earlier on Wednesday morning, the royal couple joined the prime minister, Charles Michel, for a ceremony at Brussels airport, where a one-minute silence at 7.58am marked the moment the first explosion ripped through the departure terminal. Airport staff, security and rescue personnel stood watch as King Philippe laid a wreath outside the departure hall.
Another event took place at Maelbeek metro station, where a bomb exploded at 9.11am.
Instead of silence, the Brussels public transport authority, known by its French acronym Stib, called on the travelling public to join staff in �쏿 minute of noise to show that we have not forgotten but remain standing against hate and terror��. The entire metro network stopped for one minute and passengers were invited to applaud.
One year on from the worst violence on Belgian soil since the end of the second world war, the country is still coming to terms with the attacks. Michel said at the weekend that authorities could have done a better job in providing support to some of the victims, amid concern about patchy follow-on care for people with severe, life-changing injuries.
�쏧n a certain number of cases there has not been enough proactivity, individualised follow-up of the victims,�� he told public broadcaster RTBF. Michel said he had felt �쐓haken�� after a recent meeting with victims�� families and urged insurance companies to speed up compensation payments.
Commemorative events are also taking place in Place de la Bourse in front of the old Brussels stock exchange, scene of a spontaneous memorial in the days after the attacks. Services are being held in cathedrals and churches, including in Molenbeek, the socially mixed district in western Brussels that became notorious after it was found to be a base for the network that launched a series of terrorist attacks.
Comp챔re discovered to his surprise that he lived only 500 metres away from a flat used by the Brussels attackers in Schaerbeek, another district where social deprivation and solid middle-class families are mixed together.
The sculptor, equally well known in Belgium for his long career as an actor in film, theatre and TV, was chosen by a government commission to make the memorial, following a competition.
He said Belgium had been changed by the attacks, which had made the country more vigilant. �쏧t happened and it can happen again,�� he said. Soldiers in army fatigues carrying guns continue to patrol streets and metro stations, guard embassies and public buildings.
The lower parts of the sculpture that sit on the ground are pitted with holes and marks intended to evoke the violence of terrorist attacks. The surface becomes smooth again as the steel bends to the sky. �쏷he stainless steel is wounded, crushed [and] when you walk along those marks disappear,�� Comp챔re said.
The shiny material is also intended to reflect the weather and mood of the passing seasons. �쏧 want this sculpture to be a reflection of what people feel and the weather will help me to do that. When it rains, it reflects tears. [When it is] just grey, sadness. When the sun is shining, there is hope and pleasant thoughts about the wounded and those who are not there.��
A Syrian passport found near the body of one of those responsible for the terror attacks in Paris belonged to someone allegedly posing as one of the hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Greece from Turkey in recent months, the police ministry in Athens said.
The news came after searches and arrests were made in the main Muslim quarter of Brussels late on Saturday, and there was also the suggestion from Bavarian authorities that a Montenegrin arrested nine days ago with a car laden with weaponry may also have been involved.
The widening web of suspected links across Europe looked certain to close down the hatches on its borders as the epic struggle to cope with the worst ever immigration crisis since the second world war continues.
Poland promptly said the Paris attacks meant it could have no part in the EU�셲 new compulsory quotas system for sharing refugees. If confirmed, the Greek government statement that one of the terrorists reached Paris by entering the EU as an alleged Syrian refugee will play mayhem with Germany�셲 open-door policies on immigration.
�쏰n the case of the Syrian passport found at the scene of the terrorist attack, we announce that the passport-holder had passed from Leros on 3 October where he was identified based on EU rules,�� said the Greek police minister, Nikos Toskas.
Greece has been under strong criticism for months, mainly from Germany, for failing to identify and register the hundreds of thousands passing through the country from Turkey en route to northern Europe. Toskas�� statement appeared to reflect resentment at the criticism.
�쏻e do not know if the passport was checked by other countries through which the holder likely passed. We will continue the painstaking and persistent effort to ensure the security of our country and Europe under difficult circumstances, insisting on complete identification of those arriving.��
The apparent tension in the Greek statement was made more explicit by the new Polish rightwing government, which sought to gain political capital from the horrific events by declaring the attacks meant the EU�셲 compulsory system of quotas for sharing refugees was dead.
�쏱oland must retain full control over its borders, asylum and immigration,�� said the new minister for European affairs, Konrad Szymanski.
The speed and timing of his remarks sparked an outcry forcing him to tone down his criticisms, but the issue will remain persistent over the coming months. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister strongly opposed to immigration, will feel vindicated in his view that western Europe is reaping what it has sown through a disastrous policy of liberal multiculturalism that will not be repeated in central and eastern Europe. He has plenty of support.
The disaster will also put pressure on the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the foremost proponent of openness towards refugees, to shift position. She hopes to make big progress towards stemming the flow of refugees in talks with Turkish leaders at a G20 summit in Antalya over the next two days. But she is under mounting pressure from within her own coalition to erect tighter border controls.
�쏻e need to know who is travelling through our country,�� said Horst Seehofer, the Bavarian prime minister and leader of Merkel�셲 sister party, the Christian Social Union. �쏛s well as more security measures, we need tighter control of the European borders, but also of the national borders.��
A 51-year-old Montenegrin man is in custody in Bavaria in southern Germany on suspicion of supplying arms and explosives to the Paris attackers, the authorities in Munich said.
The man was stopped in a Volkswagen Golf with Montenegrin plates near Bavaria�셲 border with Austria on 5 November. A pistol was found under the engine hood and the car was then taken apart to reveal a sophisticated smuggling operation with automatic weapons, 200 grammes of TNT, hand grenades and ammunition carefully concealed in the car�셲 bodywork, according to Bavarian public radio.
Bavarian investigators immediately alerted the French authorities after the man was arrested, the report said. The interior ministry in Munich confirmed the report.
�쏶omeone transporting several Kalashnikovs, hand grenades, and explosives could be from the serious crime sector. But there are reasons to suspect that this is about terrorist intentions, or someone supplying weapons to terrorists,�� said Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian interior minister. The interior ministry was �쐇ntensively investigating together with the French authorities whether there is a connection with the events in Paris��.
Examination of the suspect�셲 mobile phone and of the car�셲 GPS system indicated the detainee was en route to Paris. In addition to the alleged Montenegrin and German connections, there were reports that at least one of the terrorists�� cars had Belgian registration plates, adding to the European dimension of the atrocities.
Belgian police raided several addresses in the heavily Muslim-populated Brussels district of Molenbeek late on Saturday, detaining several. Belgian media claimed three of the assailants in Paris were Belgian.
The Belgian justice minister, Koen Geens, told Flemish television that the arrests came after a car with Belgian registration plates was seen close to the Bataclan theatre in Paris on Friday night. He said it was a rented car.
Iran�셲 Revolutionary Guards have blamed Saudi Arabia for the first terrorist attack claimed by Islamic State in their country, setting the stage for spiralling tensions between the two rivals at a critical moment in the region.
At least 12 people were killed and dozens more injured in Tehran on Wednesday when gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the Iranian parliament and the mausoleum of the revolutionary founder of the Islamic Republic.
Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks, publishing a brief video that purported to show the assailants inside the parliament.
Reza Seifollhai, the deputy head of Iran�셲 National Security Council, said on state television that the assailants were Iranian Isis recruits.
�쏛bout the identity of the attackers I should say they were from parts of Iran, and had joined Daesh,�� Seifollhai said, using the Arabic name for Isis.
But the hardline Revolutionary Guards blamed Riyadh for the attack, in a move that could further raise the stakes in a regional tussle that has already led to major diplomatic upheaval among the Gulf monarchies in recent days and the isolation of Qatar over, in part, its perceived closeness to Iran.
�쏷his terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region�셲 reactionary governments [Saudi Arabia] �� shows they are involved in this savage action,�� the IRGC said in a statement.
The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said the attacks would make the country more united. �쏷oday�셲 terrorist attacks in Tehran will make the Islamic Republic of Iran more determined in the fight against regional terrorism, extremism and violence,�� he said in a statement published on the ISNA news agency. �쏻e will prove once again that we will crush the enemies�� plots with more unity and more strength.��
The assault on the parliament began when four men armed with rifles burst into the building complex. One of the attackers reportedly blew himself up inside as police surrounded the building.
Gunfire could be heard from outside as police helicopters circled overhead, entrance and exit gates were closed, and contact with mobile phones inside was lost.
�쏧 was inside the parliament when shooting happened. Everyone was shocked and scared. I saw two men shooting randomly,�� one journalist at the scene, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
MPs continued scheduled sessions in another part of the complex. The deputy interior minister, Mohammad Hossein Zolfaghari, told Iran�셲 state TV that the attackers were dressed as women in order to gain entry.
About five hours after the first reports, Iranian news agencies said all four assailants were dead and the incident was over.
Ali Larijani, the Iranian parliamentary speaker, called the attack a cowardly act. �쏧ran is an active and effective pillar in the fight against terrorists and they want to damage it,�� he said.
Soon after the assault on the parliament began, reports emerged of another incident about 12 miles (19km) south at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who established the Islamic Republic after deposing the shah in 1979.
Two assailants entered the grounds of the shrine, killing a gardener and wounding several other people. One detonated a suicide vest, and the other was shot dead. It was not clear whether the shrine attackers were women, as had been reported earlier, or were just dressed like women.
�쏷he terrorists had explosives strapped to them and suddenly entered the shrine and started to shoot around,�� the shrine�셲 overseer, Mohammadali Ansari, told Reuters.
Iran�셲 emergency services said a total of 12 people were killed in the two attacks and 43 wounded. It was not clear whether that toll included the attackers.
The Iranian intelligence ministry said a third team had been arrested before carrying out a planned attack.
Isis released a statement late on Wednesday, threatening Iran�셲 majority Shia population with more attacks: �쏷he caliphate will not miss a chance to spill their blood��.
Attacks are extremely rare in the capital and other major Iranian cities, although a Sunni militant group named Jundallah and its splinter group, Ansar al-Furqan, have been waging a deadly insurgency, mostly in more remote areas, for almost a decade.
Isis, which adheres to a puritanical strain of Sunni Islam, considers Shias heretics and has carried out numerous attacks against Shia civilians, in Iraq in particular. But this assault, which appeared to have a higher degree of coordination and planning than recent Isis-claimed attacks in Europe, would be a significant escalation.
It took place against a backdrop of great regional tension, with Arab Gulf countries pushing for a more forceful isolation of Iran, their regional arch-enemy. The Gulf states earlier this week severed diplomatic relations with their neighbour Qatar over its close relationship with Tehran.
Donald Trump, who took sides with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states against Qatar, issued a statement offering prayers for Wednesday�셲 victims. But he also repeated his accusations that Iran supports terror and implied that it bore some blame for the attack.
The US president said: �쏻e grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times. We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.��
Last month, Iranian voters re-elected Rouhani, a relatively moderate figure, by a landslide in presidential elections. The high-profile attack on one of the most well-guarded buildings in the capital will come as a blow to the reformist president, who will have to address demands for greater security in the face of the Isis threat.
Isis put out a rare video in Persian in March, warning that it would �쐁onquer Iran and restore it to the Sunni Muslim nation as it was before��, while accusing Iranians of persecuting Sunnis over the centuries.
Charlie Winter, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King�셲 College London, said: �쏧slamic State has been agitating in Iran for years now but its supporters there haven�셳 received much attention in the past. In 2016, Isis eulogised seven Iranian suicide attackers that had died in operations in Iraq and Syria.��
Compared with many of its neighbours, he said, Iran was a stable state with �쐍otoriously effective�� security services.
�쏷hat�셲 why we�셶e not seen an attack there until now. I don�셳 doubt that the Islamic State has planned operations in Iran in the past �� this is just the first one to be a success.��
After postponing her tour in the wake of the terror attack at her Manchester concert on 22 May, Ariana Grande has returned to the stage in Paris.
The US pop star resumed her Dangerous Woman tour at the city�셲 AccorHotels Arena, writing afterwards on Instagram, �쏮erci, Paris �� Je t�셙ime Grateful to be back��.
Earlier in the day, she had posted another Instagram message referring to the victims of the Manchester attack, saying: �쏷hinking of our angels every step of the way. I love you with all my heart.��
22 people were killed in the foyer of the Manchester Arena immediately following Grande�셲 concert, in a suicide bomb attack that injured 119 others. Grande immediately postponed further UK tour dates, and set about organising a benefit concert, One Love Manchester, which was held last weekend at the city�셲 Old Trafford cricket ground. With its remarkable roster of pop stars, including Justin Bieber, Coldplay and Katy Perry, the concert became the UK�셲 most viewed TV show of the year, with 14.5 million people watching. It helped to raise more than 짙10m in donations for the victims and their families.
Grande closed that show with a rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which has since been released as a charity single. Her current single One Last Time is expected to soar up this week�셲 charts, which will be announced on Friday.
�쏶pecific�� advance evidence of a terror plot threatening UK interests is not legally necessary before launching pre-emptive drone strikes against suspects overseas, according to the the attorney general.
In a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Jeremy Wright QC denied that the threshold for self-defence was being �쐗atered down�� but said not knowing the target, type or time of a terrorist attack should not prevent military action.
�쏧n a world where a small number of committed plotters may be seeking to inspire, enable and direct attacks around the world, and indeed have a proven track record of doing so, we will not always know where and when an attack will take place, or the precise nature of the attack,�� Wright said.
�쏝ut where the evidence supports an assessment that an attack is imminent it cannot be right that a state is prevented from meeting its first duty of protecting its citizens without nailing down the specific target and timing of an attack. Apart from anything else, our enemies will not always have fixed plans. They are often opportunists.��
Wright�셲 speech was aimed at redefining and clarifying the legal basis for future RAF drone strikes intended to counter terrorist threats from jihadists or other �쐍on-state actors��.Any threat, however, must be deemed to be �쐇mminent��. He said he was adopting a series of tests (pdf) devised in 2012 by Sir Daniel Bethlehem, a former foreign office legal adviser, to justify strikes.
Bethlehem�셲 factors include assessing the nature and immediacy of the threat; the probability of an attack; whether it is part of a concerted pattern of continuing activity; the likely scale of any threat, and the injury, loss or damage likely to result; and the likelihood that there will be other opportunities to undertake effective action in self-defence that may be expected to cause less serious collateral injury, loss or damage.Wright congratulated the US for having already adopted Bethlehem�셲 �쏿ppreciation of imminence�� tests but insisted he was not supporting a legal doctrine which �쏿mounts to a global war on terror��.
The UK�셲 support for international law �쐇s undimmed��, the attorney general said. �쏷he UK should and will only use armed force, and will only act in self-defence, where it is consistent with international law to do so.�쒾elf-defence is legal under article 51 of the United Nations charter, which states that �쐍othing shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs�� against a UN member.
Any action must be �쐀oth necessary and proportionate to the threat,�� Wright said. Where an attack has not yet taken place it must be �쐇mminent�� to justify states taking action.
Wright said: �쏯ow, an individual so inclined can watch a video on YouTube, source an instruction manual on homemade explosives on the darkweb, and act on whatever misconceived ideology they have absorbed, all in a short space of time, without travelling abroad and without direct communication with any established organisational leadership. The world is changing fast and we must be sure the law is keeping up.�쏬ethal action will always be a last resort, when there is no other option to defend ourselves against an attack and no other means to detain, disrupt or otherwise prevent those plotting acts of terror.��
The attorney general�셲 speech follows calls from both parliament�셲 joint committee on human rights and senior military figures for greater clarification of the concept of imminence and the circumstances under which drone attacks abroad are legally justified.
Wright�셲 praise for the approach taken by the US, which critics believe involves a lower legal threshold, sounded alarm bells for many human rights groups.
The CIA and other US agencies have carried out as many as 700 covert attacks on al-Qaida and Islamic State suspects on the grounds of pre-emptive self-defence in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, according to the human rights organisation Reprieve. The US is not at war with those countries.
As attorney general, Wright sits on the UK�셲 National Security Council along with the prime minister, foreign secretary, defence secretary and other senior ministers. The NSC has several subcommittees including one that deals with �쐁ountering terrorism��.
Philippe Sands QC, professor of international law at University College London, said Wright�셲 speech �쐅enerally mirrors the approach taken by Lord [Peter] Goldsmith, [Labour�셲 attorney general in 2004] with which I clearly agreed, but there are tweaks in the precise formulations which suggest the possibility that the door to the use of force may have been opened slightly wider.��
Sands said: �쏷he crucial point is that everything turns on the facts, ... That necessarily means that the system works where there�셲 real public trust in the decision-taker ... It�셲 a tiny tweaking in the language and who knows whether that is intended to effect a change or not.��
Chris Cole, the founder of Drone Wars UK, which monitors military use of unmanned aircraft, said: �쏻e are likely to see a small group of people from the National Security Council decide behind closed doors whether a particular individual on a potential kill list has sufficiently met the test to be targeted by a drone strike.
�쏷here will be no advocate for the defendant but there will be enormous pressure to greenlight a strike as there will always be the fear of what may happen if permission is denied and an attack subsequently does take place. There are undoubtedly terrorist threats to the UK from those who fundamentally disagree with western liberal values but our response simply cannot be to jettison those very values and adopt wholesale a policy of extra-judicial killing.��
Jennifer Gibson of Reprieve, who works with civilian victims of strikes, said: �쏷hroughout the discredited �쁶ar on terror��, the US has tried to redefine language to avoid liability for human rights abuses. Mr Wright has adopted the same strategy today. The British government cannot unilaterally change international law because they want to assassinate people, any more than Donald Trump can bring back waterboarding.
�쏝ritain is meant to be a leader when it comes to human rights. Yet Mr Wright is attempting to redefine the law to provide cover for the UK�셲 previous illegal actions. In doing so, he is taking the UK down the slippery slope of a failed US drone programme �� one that has killed countless civilians, and done nothing to make us safer.��
Research by Reprieve in 2014 alleged that for 41 named targets of US attacks, covert strikes killed 1,147 men, women and children who were not targets. �쏷he intelligence behind the strikes was so poor that individuals had been targeted as many as 10 times without success,�� according to Reprieve.
Sine July 2015, there has been a series of drone strikes on Britons in Syria including Abu Rahin Aziz, Reyaad Khan, Ruhul Amin, Junaid Hussain and Mohammed Emwazi.
Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, delivered a withering attack on the invasion of Iraq, decried the term "war on terror", and held out the prospect of talks with al-Qaida.
Recording her first BBC Reith lecture on the theme, Securing Freedom, she made clear she believed the UK and US governments had not sufficiently understood the resentment that had been building up among Arab people, which was only compounded by the war against Iraq.
Before an audience which included Theresa May, the home secretary, she also said the 9/11 attacks were "a crime, not an act of war". "So I never felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror".
Young Arabs, she said, had no opportunity to choose their own rulers. "For them an external enemy was a unifying way to address some of their frustrations."They were also united by the plight of Palestinians, a view that the west was exploiting their oil and supporting dictators. "It was wrong to say all terrorists belonged to al-Qaida," added Manningham-Buller.
Pursuing a theme which some in the audience may have been astounded to hear from a former boss of MI5, she said terrorist campaigns �� she mentioned Northern Ireland as an example �� could not be solved militarily. She described the invasion of Iraq as a "distraction in the pursuit of al-Qaida". She added: "Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator but neither he nor his regime had anything to do with 9/11." The invasion, she said, "provided an arena for jihad", spurring on UK citizens to resort to terror.
September 11 was a "monstrous crime" but it needed a considered response, an appreciation of the causes and roots of terrorism, she said later in answers to questions. She said she hoped there were those �� she implied in western governments �� who were considering having "talks with al-Qaida".
Some way must be found of approaching them, she suggested, though she said she did not know how, at the moment, that could be done.
Manningham-Buller, who retired in 2007, attacked the invasion of Iraq in an interview with the Guardian in 2009. However, she has never before expressed such antipathy towards the prevailing policies and rhetoric of the government which she had to endure when she was in office. The lecture is to be broadcast on Radio 4 on 6 September, and entitled Terror.
At first sight, it seems hard to imagine a more unlikely pairing than George Orwell and Thomas Merton. Orwell had a profound dislike of Roman Catholic writers (though he accorded a grudging respect to Evelyn Waugh as a literary craftsman), and, had he encountered Merton �� especially his earlier work �� he would undoubtedly have recoiled. Not that Merton, whose centenary is this year, was a conventional religious writer. He became a Catholic in 1938 after a distinctly rackety youth, and spent most of the rest of his life as a Trappist monk in the US. But he wrote copiously, corresponding with a wide range of literary figures, including Henry Miller, James Baldwin, Czes흢aw Mi흢osz, Boris Pasternak and several Latin American poets, some of whose work he also translated; another surprising friend was Joan Baez. He left behind him, in addition to a huge amount of journal material and many books on prayer and monasticism, a couple of incomplete drafts for novels and a fair quantity of poetry, published and unpublished, some of it dramatically �쐃xperimental�� in style. By the mid 1960s, he was vocal in his criticisms of the Vietnam war, of the stockpiling of nuclear arms and of racial segregation and injustice in the US. And a central element in his critique of militarism was a stinging analysis of the language of war and weaponry.
This is where the conversation with Orwell might begin. In 1967, Merton published an essay on �쏻ar and the Crisis of Language��, in which he develops a distinctly Orwellian polemic against the corruption of writing itself by certain aspects of modernity. The speech of military strategists and of politicians is characterised by a narcissistic finality. There can be no real reply to the careful and reasonable calculation of the balance of mass killing in a nuclear war, because everything is so organised that you are persuaded not to notice what it is you are talking about. And when that happens, you cannot intelligently converse or argue: all there is is the definitive language imposed by those who have power. It is a natural extension of the language habitually used to describe the processes of other kinds of war. Merton relished the comment of an American commander in Vietnam: �쏧n order to save the village, it became necessary to destroy it��, and memorably summed up the philosophy of many supporters of the Vietnam intervention:
�쏷he Asian whose future we are about to decide is either a bad guy or a good guy. If he is a bad guy, he obviously has to be killed. If he is a good guy, he is on our side and he ought to be ready to die for freedom. We will provide an opportunity for him to do so: we will kill him to prevent him falling under the tyranny of a demonic enemy.��
The main point in all this is that creating a language that cannot be checked by or against any recognisable reality is the ultimate mark of power. What Merton characterises as �쐂ouble-talk, tautology, ambiguous cliche, self-righteous and doctrinaire pomposity and pseudoscientific jargon�� is not just an aesthetic problem: it renders dialogue impossible; and rendering dialogue impossible is the desired goal for those who want to exercise absolute power. Merton was deeply struck by the accounts of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, and by Hannah Arendt�셲 discussions of the �쐀anality�� of evil. The staggeringly trivial and contentless remarks of Eichmann at his trial and before his execution ought to frighten us, says Merton, because they are the utterance of the void: the speech of a man accustomed to power without the need to communicate or learn or imagine anything. And that is why Merton insists that knowing how to write is essential to honest political engagement.
In an essay on Camus, whom he, like Orwell, admired greatly, Merton says that the writer�셲 task �쐇s not suddenly to burst out into the dazzle of utter unadulterated truth but laboriously to reshape an accurate and honest language that will permit communication �� instead of multiplying a Babel of esoteric and technical tongues��. Against the language of power, which seeks to establish a perfect self-referentiality, the writer opposes a language of �쐋aborious�� honesty. Instead of public speech being the long echo of absolute and unchallengeable definitions supplied by authority �� definitions that tell you once and for all how to understand the world�셲 phenomena �� the good writer attempts to speak in a way that is open to the potential challenge of a reality she or he does not own and control. When the military commander speaks of destroying a village to save it, the writer�셲 job is to speak of the specific lives ended in agony. When the agents of Islamist terror call suicide bombers �쐌artyrs��, the writer�셲 job is to direct attention to the baby, the Muslim grandmother, the Jewish aid worker, the young architect, the Christian nurse or taxi driver whose death has been triumphantly scooped up into the glory of the killer�셲 self-inflicted death. When, as it was a few months ago, the talk is of hordes and swarms of aliens invading our shores, the writer�셲 task is to focus on the corpse of a four-year-old boy on the shore; to the great credit of many in the British media, there were writers (and cartoonists and photographers, too) who rose to that task.
In another essay on war, Merton argues that it is not really true that war happens when reasoned argument breaks down; it is more that �쐒eason�� has been used in such a way that it subtly and inevitably moves us towards war. In his great 1946 essay on �쏱olitics and the English Language��, Orwell is clear that linguistic degeneration is both the product and the generator of economic and political decadence. And if so, the critique of this degeneration is not a matter of �쐓entimental archaism�� but an urgent political affair. Like Merton, he identifies the stipulative definition as one of the main culprits: a word that ought to be descriptive, and so discussable, comes to be used evaluatively. �쏤ascism�� means �쐏olitics I/we don�셳 like��; �쐂emocracy�� means �쐏olitics I/we do like��. �쏞onsequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.�� This is really just a symptom of a deeper malaise. Vagueness, mixed metaphor, ready-made phrases, �쐅umming together long strips of words��, pseudo�몋echnical language are ways of avoiding communication. And those whose interest is in avoiding communication are those who do not want to be replied to or argued with.
Orwell�셲 rules for good writing have become familiar: don�셳 use secondhand metaphors, don�셳 use long words where short ones will do, abbreviate, use the active not the passive, never use a foreign phrase when you can find an everyday alternative in English. They are rules designed to communicate something other than the fact that the speaker is powerful enough to say what he or she likes. Bad or confused metaphor (Orwell has some choice examples of which my favourite is �쏷he Fascist octopus has sung its swan song��) presents us with something we can�셳 visualise; good metaphor makes us more aware, in unexpected ways, of what we see or sense. So bad metaphor is about concealing or ignoring; and language that sets out to conceal or ignore and make others ignore is language that wants to shrink the limits of the world to what can be dealt with in the speaker�셲 terms alone.
But there is something more to be said, which Orwell, a stout enemy of literary modernism, doesn�셳 quite want to say. In some earlier essays, he had argued that it wouldn�셳 be the end of the world if literature became less obviously sophisticated, if the range of cultural references in our writing had to be reduced in order to open it up to more participants. Without quite anticipating the more recent debates about whether there is a real difference between �쐆igh�� and �쐋ow�� culture, there is in his work a consistent strand of scepticism about anything that looks like complexity for its own sake, and a feeling that it ought to be possible to say things straightforwardly. And this is where he and Merton might part company. Merton was an enthusiastic modernist in this respect. A good deal of his poetry and some of his prose is written under the heavy influence of Joyce, and his letters to his old friend, the poet Robert Lax, use a bewildering macaronic style, bursting with puns and allusions and intricate wordplays. It is one of the ways in which he obeys his own injunction to be �쐋aborious��. He can even say that, on top of the obligation to write �쐂isciplined prose��, a writer has �쐔he duty of first writing nonsense �� to let loose what is hidden in our depths, to expand rather than to condense prematurely��.
The paradox that Merton is asserting is that, in order to be honest, the writer sometimes has to be difficult; and the problem facing any writer who acknowledges this is how to distinguish between necessary or salutary difficulty and self-serving obfuscation of the kind both he and Orwell identify as a tool of power. I doubt whether there is a neat answer to this. But I suspect that the essential criterion is to do with whether a writer�셲 language �� �쐓traightforward�� or not �� invites response. Both Merton and Orwell concentrate on a particular kind of bureaucratic redescription of reality, language that is designed to be no one�셲 in particular, the language of countless contemporary manifestos, mission statements and regulatory policies, the language that dominates so much of our public life, from health service to higher education. In its more malign forms, this is also the language of commercial interests defending tax evasion in a developing country, or worse, governments dealing with challenges to human rights violations, or worst of all (it�셲 in all our minds just now) of terrorists who have mastered so effectively the art of saying nothing true or humane as part of their techniques of intimidation. In contrast, the difficulty of good writing is a difficulty meant to make the reader pause and rethink. It insists that the world is larger than the reader thought, and invites the reader to find new ways of speaking: it may in the short term draw attention to its own complexity, but it does so in order that the reader may move away from the text to think about what it is in the world around that prompts such complexity. Bad writing is politically poisonous; good writing is politically liberating �� and this is true even when that good writing comes from sources that are ideologically hostile to good politics (however defined). The crucial question is whether the writing is directed to making the reader see, feel and know less or more. And the paradox is that, even faced with systems that stifle good writing and honest imagining, the good writer doesn�셳 respond in kind but goes on trying to fathom what the terrorist and the bigot are saying, to make sense of people who don�셳 want to make sense of him or her. Failing to do that condemns us to bad writing and bad politics, to the language of total conflict and radical dehumanisation.
Our current panics about causing �쐎ffence�� are, at their best and most generous, an acknowledgement of how language can encode and enact power relations (my freedom of �쐎ffending�� speech may be your humiliation, a confirmation of your exclusion from ordinary public discourse). But at its worst, it is a patronising and infantilising worry about protecting individuals from challenge; the inevitable end of that road is a far worse entrenching of unquestionable power, the power of a discourse that is never open to reply. Debates about international issues such as Israel and Palestine, or issues of social and personal morals �� abortion, gender and sexuality, end-of-life questions �� are regularly shadowed by anxiety, even panic, about what must not be said in public, and also by the sometimes startlingly coercive insistence on the �쐒ational�� and canonical status of one perspective only. On both sides of all such debates, there can be a deep unwillingness to have things said or shown that might profoundly challenge someone�셲 starting assumptions. If there is an answer to this curious contemporary neurosis, it is surely not to be found in the silencing of disagreement but rather in the education of speech: how is unwelcome truth to be told in ways that do not humiliate or disable? And the answer to that question is inseparable from learning to argue �� from the actual practice of open exchange, in the most literal sense �쐁ivil�� disagreement, the debate appropriate to citizens who have dignity and liberty to discuss their shared world and its organisation and who are able to learn what their words sound like in the difficult business of staying with such a debate as it unfolds.
Of all the various lessons to be learned from Merton and Orwell as analysts of linguistic decadence, the most obvious is that literature and drama are not a luxury in society. Politics can�셳 avoid the drift towards the twin abysses of totalitarianism and triviality if it refuses to face the perils of this decadence. Good writing is many things. For Orwell it is primarily to do with the capacity for reasoned prose and the sustained personal narratives of classical fiction. For Merton, it includes some wilder elements, the freedom for wordplay and the absurd, as well as poetic experimentation. But it is always writing that declines to close down either perception or argument. This is how good writing defends us from absolute power or �� which comes to much the same thing �� absolute social stasis. It leaves a trail to be followed and asks questions that require an answer: it pushes towards a future. This obviously doesn�셳 mean �� recalling Orwell�셲 observation �� that good writing is �쐏rogressive��; only that it is aware of being between past and future, living in time. And Merton, with another theological twist that Orwell would probably not have much appreciated, also implies that if our fundamental human problem is �쏱rometheanism��, wanting to steal divinity from God rather than labouring at being human, then good writing, with its inbuilt ironies and its awareness of its own conditions, is one of the things that stop us imagining we are more than human.
Perhaps that�셲 as good a definition of good writing as we�셱e going to find. Destructive politics is inevitably bound up with forgetfulness of our humanity, in one way or another �� the organised inhumanity of tyranny, the messianic aspirations of communism, the passion for control on the part of managerial modernity, the naked and brutal murderousness of terrorism. But Merton explicitly, and Orwell implicitly, remind us that this is not just about bad governance or oppression. If we talk and write badly, dishonestly, unanswerably, what we are actually doing is getting ready for war. The habits of mind that make war inevitable are the habits of bad language �� that is to say, the habits that grow from uncritical attitudes to power and privilege: contempt towards the powerless, towards minorities, towards the stranger, the longing for an end to human complexity and difference. Orwell explicitly and (perhaps) Merton implicitly are trying to identify the all-important possibility that we may passionately quarrel, even that we may fight to defend ourselves against political evil in one way or another, without simply buying into various kinds of totalitarianism, overt or covert. Orwell has an almost medieval sense of what is involved in battling to the death to defend yourself against an enemy for whom you retain a degree of human respect, in that you do not seek to dehumanise them, to put them once and for all outside the boundaries of human discourse and exchange.
However we pursue that fight (not exactly an academic question today; and Orwell and Merton would disagree sharply here, I think, given Merton�셲 near pacifism), the central moral question is whether we are going to use the language of tautology and self-justification �� one that gives us alone the right to be called reasonable and human �� or whether we labour to discover other ways of speaking and imagining. If we settle for the former, we are already planning the next round of violence. The latter is hard and counterintuitive because it does not promise what most of us are secretly longing for: a simple end to conflict and complication. But it is the very opposite of resignation, because it summons the writer to work, to the constant creation and re-creation of an authentically shared culture �� the pattern of free and civil exchange that is neither bland nor violent. The �쐓mall blue capsule of indignation�� �� in Merton�셲 words �� has to be punctured again and again. And if he is right, that means the writer needs rather more than just ideas; she or he needs something of the contemplative liberty to sift out the motivation towards bad writing that comes from the terrors and ambitions of the ego, and to find the liberty to allow words, both fresh and puzzling, to arrive. It�셲 easy to imagine Orwell�셲 raised eyebrows at the thought of his contemplative vocation, but if this brief attempt at staging an encounter between these two passionate and contentious writers has come anywhere near the truth, that�셲 what might have to be said about the calling not only of Orwell but of any writer worth reading.
�� This is an edited extract of the 2015 Orwell lecture. The full version is available at theorwellprize.co.uk/the-orwell-lecture-2015/
On 25 February 1830 Victor Hugo's play Hernani was performed to the most extraordinary scenes of riot and disorder in Paris. The subject of the now-forgotten work was the attempted assassination of a king by a Romantic Spanish outlaw hero, Hernani, who ends his days in a suicide pact. The play had been banned by the official censor, but on the first night Hugo gathered around him a gang of long-haired young bloods known as the Romantic Army, who fought pitched street battles to force the authorities to allow the play to go ahead. Hugo partisans all wore a badge bearing the Spanish word for iron, hierro, to identify them and mark their steely determination to fight the forces of conventional bourgeois liberalism.
For Paul Berman, the play is an early expression of the terrorist mentality. 'Murder as rebellion, suicide as honour, murder and suicide as the joint emblem of human freedom - those were Hugo's themes.' These, he argues, in a compelling challenge to modern liberal attititudes, are also the common thread in the terrorist mindset that links early anarchists and Bolsheviks in Russia to the hijacking and urban terrorism of the PLO and the Baader-Meinhof gang in the 1970s.
More radically, Berman also sees a link to the terrorism of al-Qaeda. The doomed assassin Hernani is not just the model for the classic anarchist or Marxist political terrorist, he is also a model for Mohamed Atta. As Malise Ruthven revealed in A Fury for God, the most enlightening of the flurry of books on al-Qaeda published in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, there were connections between Islamism and totalitarian ideology in the early twentieth century. The founder of the the Islamic revivalist Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan al-Banna, for example, was an admirer of the Nazis. Berman argues that the founder of modern Islamism, Sayyid Qutb, drew on the Marxist concept that 'truth can be obtained only through some kind of active struggle' in developing theories yoking the search for truth and martyrdom.
Berman draws similar links between fascism and Baathism, the Arab national socialism both of the fallen regime in Baghdad and of that which still rules neighbouring Syria. He quotes Sami al-Jundi, who helped found the Syrian Baath Party in the 1930s: 'We were racists, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the source of its thought, particularly Nietzsche.' So, paradoxically, the drive towards Muslim or Arab purity in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has its roots in a European ideology promoting Aryan purity in the nineteenth century. 'The Baathists and the Islamists were two branches of a single impulse, which was Muslim totalitarianism - the Muslim variation of the European idea,' writes Berman.
But their common origins do not mean that Baathism and Islamism are the same, as radical Shia opponents of Saddam Hussein's rule discovered. Baathism is an essentially secular nationalist movement that wished to recreate the glory of the Arab conquests in a modern context. That is quite different from the most extreme Islamist radicalism which aims to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate under sharia law.
At times Berman trips over the ingenuity of his own argument. The Romantic impulse of Victor Hugo's Hernani, glorying in death, assassination and suicide, mutates in Terror and Liberalism into every ideological monster of the twentieth century, including the totalitarian regimes of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini. To follow Berman's logic, the nihilistic suicide bombers of the Palestinian occupied territories are indistinguishable from the torturers of the concentration camps, a connection made by few but the most extreme representatives of the Israeli state.
The most chilling passage in Terror and Liberalism concerns what Berman describes as 'the most powerful of modern myths': that there is a single 'people of God' whose role it is to guide the world back to the path of righteousness, whatever the human cost. In this the godly are in cosmic conflict with the Satanic 'city dwellers of Babylon'.
Berman's version of this conflict has terrifying contemporary resonances. 'The war of Armageddon will take place. The subversive and polluted city dwellers of Babylon will be exterminated along with all their abominations. The Satanic forces from the mystic beyond will be fended off. The destruction will last only an hour. Afterward, when the extermination is complete, the reign of Christ will be established and will endure a thousand years. And the people of God will live in purity, submissive to God.' Today Babylon is better known as Hilla, a town south of Baghdad where the Reuters agency saw the first evidence of the American use of cluster bombs on civilians in Iraq.
In light of recent events, Berman's description of a paranoid 'people of God' convinced of its own righteousness, prepared to kill its enemies and sacrifice its own in pursuit of a realm of pure truth might just as easily apply to the United States as to its Baathist and Islamist foes.
In a remarkable insight into the motives behind the alleged would-be bombers, Hussain Osman, arrested in Rome on Friday, has revealed how the suspects watched hours of TV footage showing grief-stricken Iraqi widows and children alongside images of civilians killed in the conflict. He is alleged to have told prosecutors that after watching the footage: 'There was a feeling of hatred and a conviction that it was necessary to give a signal - to do something.'
But some of the Italian media reports told a conflicting story. Some reports quoted Osman as saying: 'I hardly know anything. They only gave me a rucksack to carry on the tube in London. We wanted to stage an attack, but only as a show. Who gave me the explosive? I don't know. I didn't know him. I don't remember. We didn't want to kill, we just wanted to scare people.'
Milan's Corriere della Sera newspaper said Osman first told authorities he did not know what was in the backpack he took on the London underground, then changed his version, saying he was told the attackers were only supposed to carry out 'demonstrative' attacks. But the Rome daily Il Messaggero said the suspect told investigators: 'We were supposed to blow ourselves up.'
Osman allegedly said: 'More than praying we discussed work, politics, the war in Iraq ... we always had new films of the war in Iraq ... more than anything else those in which you could see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers.'
If these reports turn out to be true, they will provide valuable insights into the workings of the alleged terrorist cells. The revelations come as police in the UK begin hunting an al-Qaeda mastermind believed to be behind the recruitment and training of both sets of London bombers.
The prospect of a UK mastermind controlling the cells raises fears that other units may be active in Britain. Despite the arrest of all five men wanted in connection with the failed attacks, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, warned last night of the risk of further bomb attacks.
According to the reports, Hussain claimed the men did not talk about al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden. 'We had no contacts with the organisation of bin Laden. We knew it existed - we accessed its programmes through the internet - but nothing directly,' he is reported to have claimed, adding that the bombings of 7 July took them by surprise: 'We never had any contact with the Pakistanis.'
However, the bombs that devastated London that day were a signal that they could go into action. 'Our boss taught us how to make explosives out of fertilisers,' he is reported to have said, claiming the men put them into rucksacks and used timers.
Security sources fear that at least one senior figure in the global terror organisation is based in the UK. He may have taken part in a whitewater rafting trip used as a bonding session for several of the suicide bombers in north Wales in early June.
Sweeping new security measures are to be introduced on Britain's road and rail networks this week, including highway patrol officers on the M25 who will check bridges for bombs.
Senior officers are particularly concerned there could be a third attack on Thursday, two weeks after the last attempt. One officer said: 'When you look at the history of terrorist attacks and of al-Qaeda in particular, there is a pattern of repeated attacks on the same targets. They hit the World Trade Centre twice. They attacked the embassies in Egypt twice. If anything the level of security around public transport on Thursday will be even higher than last.'
Rather than the two cells being linked directly, investigators are now focusing on the idea that the men responsible for the 7 July bombs and those behind the failed attacks on 21 July may have been recruited and directed by the same person.
'If you look at the structure of al-Qaeda, what you basically have is a pyramid,' a security source told The Observer. 'If you see the two groups of bombers as two separate teams of footsoldiers on the very bottom, then there is a possibility they are linked by the command structure in the level above. This is the level we are trying to identify and track down.'
The hunt has been given fresh impetus by this new intelligence which suggests that, rather than being manufactured between them, the explosives given to the bombers were handed over by people so far unidentified.
Italian officials are preparing extradition proceedings against Osman. They say he was born in Ethiopia, not Somalia, and may have used fake documents to obtain British citizenship.
The Interior Minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, told his parliament yesterday that Osman had tried to evade capture with the help of contacts among Italy's Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrant communities, after fleeing London on the Eurostar train.
The suspect appeared before magistrates yesterday. His lawyer, Antonietta Sonnessa, objected to his extradition and said it could take up to two months for him to be returned to London.
It has also emerged that Britain's Somali community 'shopped' the first alleged bomber, Hassan Omar, who was found in Birmingham last Wednesday.
Asset-freezing powers exercised under counter-terrorism legislation are "an intrusive and humiliating experience" for a number of British citizens, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terror laws has warned in a report.
The Terrorist Asset Freezing Act 2010 places a small number of suspects and their families under "what amounts to financial house arrest", David Anderson QC said in the report submitted to the Treasury and published on Thursday.
Anderson adds, however, that the freezing of terrorists' assets does deter and disrupt their activities, even if such measures are not as important as it was thought they would be in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
He also concludes that the 2010 Act is an improvement on powers previously relied upon by the government, which were quashed by the supreme court last year because they did not have a proper legislative footing.
There are 34 individuals and eight groups currently subjected to the asset freezing powers, none of them in Northern Ireland. The majority of the individuals are either in prison in the UK or living overseas.
Anderson, who took up the post in February, said that those individuals who are in the UK needed to seek approval and account for every item of expenditure, a humiliation that they feel amounts to punishment.
He recommends that a number of improvements aimed at bringing greater transparency to the use of the act's powers, including the publication of reviews of individual cases and the number and basis of legal challenges to asset-freezing orders.
Turkish troops and tanks near the Syrian border are making final plans to attack the US military�셲 Kurdish partners inside northern Syria as tensions between Ankara and Washington near unprecedented levels.
Ahead of a widely expected incursion, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo휓an, threatened to �쐂estroy all terror nests��, a reference to Kurdish forces that the US has used as proxies in the fight against Islamic State (Isis) and Turkey views as a subversive threat.
Tensions over the Kurds, which have tested relations between two nominal allies for the past three years, spiked over the weekend, when Washington announced it would raise a border force from the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defence Force, which led the battle against Isis in north-east Syria.
Ankara views the Syrian Kurds as an extension of the Turkish Kurdish PKK, with whom it has fought a four decade insurgency inside its borders. It has vowed not to allow Kurdish groups to dominate its border with Syria.
The area most likely to be invaded by Turkish forces is a 60 mile-stretch lying between the towns of Afrin and Manbij , one of the most bitterly contested pockets of territory during the Syrian conflict. The US-raised force is proposed for north-east Syria, which Ankara is not thought to be targeting for a ground attack.
The move seems aimed to strike a symbolic wedge between the north-east and a smaller Kurdish presence along Syria�셲 north-west border. It would also stake a new marker for relations between Erdo휓an and the Trump administration, which have steadily deteriorated over the Kurdish issue.
Erdo휓an said he had not consulted Donald Trump on any planned operations.�쏬ast time we spoke, he said he would get back to me. He still didn�셳. So I�셫 not planning to call him. In a short span of time, we will destroy all terror nests, one by one, in Syria, starting from Afrin and Manbij regions,�� Erdo휓an said. �쏷hose who stabbed us in the back and appear to be our allies ... cannot prevent it.��
Erdo휓an said it would be a joint operation involving the Turkish army and Syrian rebels backed by Ankara, and urged Nato to act to protect Turkey�셲 borders. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevl체t 횉avu힊o휓lu, went further in criticism of the Trump administration, saying Washington ought to clarify �쐗hether it chooses to be with its allies or terror groups��.
Ankara has been a prominent backer of the anti-Assad opposition since late 2011, arming rebel groups and allowing political opposition to organise.
Its involvement became more direct in mid-2016, when it sent troops to fight Isis and to establish its influence in the same area it intends to invade.
The Turkish fear then, and now, is that the Kurds have ambitions to establish a self-governing canton in north Syria along the entire border. The Syrian Kurds claim to have no links to the PKK, but they receive significant backing from the Turkish group and follow the same leader, Abdullah 횜calan, who has been jailed on an island off Istanbul for almost 20 years.
The Syrian Kurds had spearheaded a US-backed campaign to oust Isis from its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa, a battle that finished in the autumn. Erdo휓an repeatedly tried to extract a pledge from the Trump administration to halt the supply of weapons to the Kurds in the aftermath of the Raqqa campaign.
The US had vowed to ask its allies to surrender weapons once the fight against Isis had been completed. A senior Turkish official told the Guardian: �쏷his is plainly ridiculous. It could not happen even if they wanted it to. All the serial numbers of the weapons have been erased to start with.��
Bashar al-Assad and Russia, which has backed him into a winning position on the battlefield, support Turkey�셲 plan, which they see as limiting US influence in the war-ravaged country.
�쏛frin is not within the coalition area of operations,�� said a US military spokesman, in a statement seemed designed to reassure Ankara that the proposed Kurdish border force will not creep into areas that Turkey deems to be extra sensitive.
US-backed rebels and Turkish-supported groups have fought alongside each other throughout the war, particularly in Idlib province, where Russia, Iran and Syrian troops have mounted a new offensive against the opposition in recent weeks. However, as the war has dragged on, alliances and agendas have splintered.In the days before its gunmen began to rampage in France, Isis had lost control of the northern Iraqi city of Sinjar and a road linking its two strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul, the most damaging in a string of military and propaganda setbacks for the group.
A drone had killed its �쐃xecutioner��, Jihadi John. Syrian government troops had broken the group�셲 year-long siege of a key air base and Iraqi government forces were massing to retake Ramadi. US bombers were targeting the oil tankers that are a key source of revenue, setting up to 300 ablaze.
There was no doubt then that the group was under serious military pressure in its Iraqi and Syrian heartland when its foot soldiers began a killing spree across Paris, in both a dramatic show of strength and a potentially risky change of strategy for a group whose focus had always been local.
Despite its taste for taunting the west with atrocity videos or threatening massacres abroad, until the Paris attacks Isis had paid attention to the areas where it holds territory, the �쐁aliphate�� statelet at the heart of the group�셲 vision and propaganda.
�쏱erhaps the most important element of [the Isis] model of jihad, and I would clarify by saying that this may be coming into question following attacks in Paris, is that its inherent strategy is local,�� Charles Lister, author of The Syrian Jihad: Evolution of the Insurgency, told a conference last week.
�쏷heir entire focus is on shaping local conditions to gain influence, leverage and then control and then �� consolidating that control.��
The group�셲 ability to sweep through new territory was key to both financing conflict on the ground in Syria and Iraq and feeding a sophisticated propaganda machine. Its claims to religious authority were bolstered, in the eyes of supporters, by dramatic military victories against forces that were far stronger and better equipped. Its slick videos, magazines and social media presence drew foreign recruits and intimidated those it ruled and those it fought. As a �쐓tate��, it could enslave women it deemed infidel and win female recruits from abroad, offering fighters sex and marriage, which rivals such as al-Qaida could promise only in the afterlife.
�쏷he existence of the state is very important to Isis�셲 global ideological appeal,�� said JM Berger, author of Isis: The State of Terror. �쏣liminating the state would likely undercut a lot of Isis recruitment and that of some of its branches in other regions.��
The Paris attacks and the bombing of a Russian passenger jet in Sinai came as that territorial expansion stalled and in some places reversed, in the face of pressure from a diverse range of enemies, from Kurdish militias backed by US bombs to Syrian troops with Russian support.
The killings might have been intended as a show of strength, a new recruiting tool for those drawn to horror, or a demonstration that Isis has the ability to punish countries trying to dismantle its rule of terror �� even as it puts its �쐁aliphate�� in some jeopardy.
The group�셲 leaders would have known that if the Paris attackers�� plans succeeded, that would bring a greater focus and ferocity to airstrikes and would be likely to increase the flow of weapons and other support to groups that are fighting Isis on the ground.
Loss of territory risks loss of morale and crucial funds. �쏛 significant part of the Isis financial model involves extracting as many resources from the territories it controls as possible, through taxes and confiscation of goods,�� said Berger.
�쏻hen Isis loses a town, it loses that revenue. More importantly, if it can�셳 capture new territory, it can�셳 renew this resource, as it will eventually bleed the towns dry. So the battle over ground counts.��
However, financial and territorial concerns that would occupy the leaders of most rebel groups may take a back seat for many in Isis because they are eager for more conflict and, in some cases, looking to the end of the world. Many believe the apocalypse is imminent and its coming will be marked by a battle between Muslims and Christians in the Syrian town of Dabiq. They have named their online magazine after the battle they expect.
For that showdown to take place, western troops must come to Syria. The US president, Barack Obama, has resisted pressure to deploy more than a handful of special forces, so Isis might be hoping to push other western powers to put forces on the ground.
Conventional troops might be able to dislodge the group from Raqqa within weeks, but even taking the de facto Isis �쐁apital�� would not end the threat it currently poses to Europe.
The collapse of the statelet would not destroy the group�셲 ideology or shatter its cells of fighters. Still filled with deadly intent, but shorn of its state and the mundane security jobs it provided on the frontline, at checkpoints or on guard duty, Isis might become even more dangerous to western nations.
�쏧sis has an apocalyptic world view, and such organisations can become even more violent when their prophetic expectations are disappointed,�� said Berger. �쏤ighting an insurgency requires a lot more people than terrorism does. If the Isis state falls, especially to an outside invasion force, the short- to medium-term result will likely be a massive wave of terrorist attacks.��
A rock festival in Germany has been closed down for the day after police received information on a suspected terror threat. Thousands of people were evacuated from the Rock am Ring, at the N체rburgring in the north-west of the country on Friday.
Police said they were investigating after getting �쐁oncrete indications�� that meant they could not �쐃xclude a possible terrorist threat��. Festival organisers said they had been asked by police to shut down the festival �쐂ue to a terrorist threat��.
The incident comes less than a fortnight after a terrorist killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester.
It was not immediately clear how many fans were in attendance, but about 90,000 were expected by the end of the weekend at the annual three-day event.
The German band Rammstein were Friday night�셲 headliners, but had not started playing. The festival�셲 organisers said they hoped to be able to go ahead on Saturday.
�쏛s safety is paramount, and it is necessary to exclude a threat to festival visitors in any case as far as possible, it was decided to suspend the festival for this day,�� police said.
Police said they had changed their security plans in the light of the Manchester attack and had increased their forces to 1,200 officers.
�쏛fter a threat could not be ruled out, all necessary measures were taken immediately. This led to the event being interrupted today for security reasons.��
Rock am Ring�셲 organisers said: �쏻e ask all the festival visitors to leave the site in a calm and controlled manner towards the exits and camping grounds. We have to support the police investigations.��
In the wake of the Manchester Arena attack, the Labour leader says �쁶e must be brave enough to admit that the war on terror is not working��. Starting the first day of campaigning since the attack, Jeremy Corbyn also links acts of extremism with British foreign policy
The Terror
 by David Andress 437pp, Little, Brown, 짙20
The teenage Rimbaud had only to write, in a school essay in 1870, "Marat and Robespierre, the young await you!" to horrify his second empire teachers. These two men were, after all, the primary architects (along with Saint-Just) of the bloody terror into which the high ideals of the French revolution had descended some 80 years earlier - and which the Paris Commune of 1870 was threatening to repeat. A few years later, the new third republic was using words dear to both Marat and Robespierre as its slogan: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity". The present fifth republic keeps them still.
Yet in the name of these very words, and of Voltaire's and Rousseau's enlightenment, some 17,000 French citizens were formally executed. Arrested, tried and trundled to their doom in batches - often within a single day - they might watch their entire family being dispatched before mounting the scaffold themselves, soaked in arterial blood. No wonder the accommodating soul of France has never properly reconciled itself to this historical moment from hell: it still sings its anthem, the bloodcurdling Marseillaise, with gusto.
If "modern history" began in 1789, was the terror of 1793-4 a birth-pang freak, or a taste of things to come? In this exhaustive account, David Andress seeks an answer by dragging the nightmare out into the ordinary, living daylight of the committee meeting and what sometimes resembles office politics. The difference, of course, is that the committee meeting is not about management restructuring but the remaking of the world, and your irritating colleagues might well be dead (with your help) by the end of the day. Andress maintains that the terror was neither (as Simon Schama suggested in Citizens) built into the revolutionary motor itself, nor the product of psychopaths, but a reaction to fear. The revolution, it seemed, was about to be destroyed by external enemies (led by Pitt's Britain and the exiled French royalists), and the enemy within - whole areas of the country preferring the devil they knew: Catholicism and an absolutist king. There is a third element which Andress's brilliantly deadpan account reveals: internecine rivalry. The revolution was in many ways an accident of circumstance arising from a bankrupted state and high food prices, with a dithery king and blockheaded nobles not quite enlightened enough to volunteer their privileges. Since all this was brewing in a context of political clubs and active amateur debate (Andress maintains that the masses kept themselves remarkably well abreast of politics at this period), it was inevitable that, once granted power, this diversity would silt into faction fighting and a plethora of rival committees. These included the sinister Committee of Public Safety - eventually outclassed by the Revolutionary Tribunal, which denied the defence any witnesses or concrete evidence. The light of reason and that pleasant late-18th-century fad for sentimentalism found their awful apogee in the eyes of the judge Fouquier-Tinville, a deadly fanatic who just "felt" if you were worthy of the chop - all in the name of what Saint-Just termed "the general good".
But this was the "late" terror, when the killing-machine was devouring those who "even vaguely criticised the Robespierrists" - anyone who moved, in fact. The terror began nearly two years before, on September 5 1793, on a day cast into eerie twilight by a major eclipse. Fighting for its survival against its enemies within and without, the republic now saw a massive popular demonstration against the scarcity of bread, hijacked by the radical sans-culottes. The National Convention (situated in the former palace of the Tuileries) was surrounded. A Jacobin delegation declared: "It is time that equality bore its scythe above all heads. It is time to horrify all the conspirators. So legislators, place Terror on the order of the day!"
The convention, founded a year before, was the revolution's main legislatory body. It was divided between the cuddlier Girondins and the colder Montagnards, shading into the ultras further to the left and then the Enrag챕s (off the scale completely), with Georges-Jacques Danton somewhere in the middle. In perpetual conflict with the other power-bases - including the Paris commune - the convention's atmosphere was, Andress admits, "poisonous". Danton helped to finish off the Girondins and was then finished off himself. It didn't help that Danton had a gift for the witty put-down: he compared ultras like H챕bert, the mild-mannered little scribbler of savage and obscene columns in Le P챔re Duchesne, to "so much internal wind that a misplaced sense of decorum prevents a man from blowing off".
Danton was the only real "hero" of the revolution, aside from the attractive journalist Camille Desmoulins - star of Hilary Mantel's extraordinary novel A Place of Greater Safety. That's assuming your taste does not extend to Maximilien Robespierre, as it does for certain friends of mine here in France.
Despite his high voice, mincing ways and old-fashioned dress, Robespierre was good at speeches. The Incorruptible (as he was known, quite justifiably) roused and cowed in equal measure, often with an aggrieved, self-pitying tone that worked strange wonders on the assembled. Most of these were either journalists or "undistinguished" lawyers in their 30s: one of the ironies Andress skilfully reveals is that the law was denied, bit by bit, by the very men who had once been practising it. And once the law goes, everything goes. Likewise, the sans-culottes - the infamous radicals who took over from the Girondins - were not the plebs and proles of counter-revolutionary propaganda but skilled workers led by "the educated political classes". If the workers of Paris and elsewhere (but mostly Paris) marched in their ranks, this was mainly out of hunger and desperation.
Their ideological spokesman, Saint-Just, was a former noble, a beautiful would-be dandy who remade himself in the image of an iceberg. He even went to his own execution at the end of the terror (he was 26) without apparent emotion - whereas Robespierre, his jaw shattered by a bullet, screamed in agony as the bandages were ripped off to fit his head into the slot.
Doomed prisoners rehearsed it all in their cells, so as not to be embarrassing when the moment came. The royals were, alas, heroically distinguished before the national razor. Killing them - including the eight-year-old heir, poor Louis-Charles, who faded away alone in his filthy, rat-infested cell - was a suicidal if politically "necessary" gesture, as it united the rest of Europe against the republic. So was re-placing the Catholic God with the Rousseauesque and rather new agey "Supreme Being", a creation of which the "virtuous" Robespierre was particularly fond.
None of these revolutionaries cared much for practicalities (Danton claimed that Robespierre "couldn't boil an egg"), and irony was lost on them. Their statements had a chilling, enlightenment transparency -just as the Nazis, in turn, sometimes sound like high romantics. Andress makes it clear that both Saint-Just and Robespierre were infatuated "with their own political virtue", existing in a bubble of ideology which, in Saint-Just's case, projected a Spartan utopia where children were separated from their parents at five and a man could be banished for having no friends.
Yet Andress quite rightly points out that these same men created a massive "volunteer" army that achieved almost as much success as Napoleon's just a few years later (he was, of course, an officer in that army - as was Goethe on the Allied side). The republic was fuelled by a war economy which only foundered, after the terror, on the famine and freeze of the terrible winter of '95. And any setback, even cooked-up ones, could be blamed on counter-revolutionaries. "Hate," wrote Alphonse Daudet a couple of generations later, "is the anger of the feeble!" The terror preached (to quote from the Convention's "mass levy" decree of August 1793), "the hatred of kings" - and the hatred of anyone who was not entirely "patriotic".
It was easy to be unpatriotic. In my own house in the Gard, all the older door or shutter-hinges that resembled the royal fleur-de-lis have been mutilated, either from zeal or fear. In this misogynistic revolution, the execution of the admirable Madame Roland was justified on the grounds that her interest in politics was "unnatural" for a female.
If Andress emphasises "the basic idealism, grotesquely misplaced as it had become, of the Jacobin revolutionaries", he also shows how the feeble poisoned righteous, revolutionary anger. For the revolution is outstanding in its lack of really great men. The educated non-entities who undertook mass killings in areas like the Auvergne or the rebellious Vend챕e were all too typical. Even Danton, for all his wit and robust charm, was ruthless when it was needed, and probably corrupt as well as opportunist. When we get to the counter-revolutionary, post-terror terror, with young dandies beating up and killing anyone suspected of being a Jacobin while the peasants starve, we almost crave Napoleon Bonaparte himself. Just as the French did, in fact.

Max Hill QC, a leading prosecutor in many of the most serious terrorism trials, has been named the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.
He will replace the human rights lawyer David Anderson QC, who marked his upcoming departure this weekend with a warning that the government�셲 anti-radicalisation strategy Prevent is faltering because it is not trusted by �쏿 very large number of decent British Muslims��.
Hill, the head of Red Lion Chambers in London, has a background in prosecuting and defending in complex cases of terrorism, homicide, fraud and corporate crime.
He prosecuted in the ricin conspiracy case and the trial of the 21 July 2005 bombers, and acted for the government in the case of Binyam Mohamed, who was awarded 짙1m compensation after alleging MI5 complicity in his interrogation under torture, and for the Metropolitan police in the 7 July 2005 attacks inquests.
The home secretary, Amber Rudd, who appointed Hill, said with the threat from terrorism continuing to evolve and diversify, it was vital to have robust oversight to ensure counter-terrorism laws were fair, necessary and proportionate. �쏮r Hill brings a wealth of experience and legal expertise to help deliver this,�� she said.
Hill, who takes over from Anderson on 1 March, said: �쏧 am very pleased to have this opportunity, which comes at a time of heightened concern about the risk from terrorism that we all face in the UK. As a practising barrister with experience in counter-terrorism and the rights of citizens facing allegations of serious crime, I look forward to working with participants at all levels and from all sides.��
Anderson, who will step down from his post at the end of the month, told ITV�셲 Peston on Sunday the Prevent strategy was well intentioned, but needed significant reform to be successful.
�쏧t�셲 very frustrating for me. I don�셳 review Prevent, there is actually no independent reviewer of Prevent; I think there should be. But whenever I talk to Muslims and whenever I talk to MPs, Prevent is what they want to talk about,�� he said.
�쏧t�셲 supposed to be the easy bit, it�셲 supposed to be about stopping all our young people being drawn into terrorism, but for one reason or another it is actually the most controversial bit, and the problem is that although there are admirable people doing the job on the ground locally, this is a programme that is simply not trusted by a very large number of decent British Muslims.
�쏧 can only indicate directions of travel because I don�셳 review the programme, but I think one thing they need to do is do a much better job of explaining what they are doing, what the basis is for the interventions they are making, what the training materials say, what is their metric for success. I think they also have to do a better job, particularly nationally, of engaging with a wider range of Muslims.��
Anderson said the power of decision rested with the government, which is reviewing its counter-terrorism strategy, including Prevent.
Red Lion Chambers said Hill would remain head and continue to maintain his �쐆eavyweight criminal practice��.
The Home Office confirmed that the role of terror laws watchdog would continue on a part-time basis but added that while Hill would continue his legal practice he will not be taking part in any terrorism trials while in office.
A couple who loved travelling together �쐂id not stand a chance�� when a terrorist opened fire on them as they sunbathed on a Tunisian beach, an inquest has heard.
John and Janet Stocker, aged 74 and 63, were among the 38 tourists killed when gunman Seifeddine Rezgui went on the rampage at the five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse.
Another woman, mother-of-four Trudy Jones, 51, who suffered fatal wounds to her neck and chest, was identified by her glittery nail varnish and dental records, the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice in London was told.
The inquest has begun to hear details of exactly how each of the 30 Britons caught up in the incident on 26 June 2015 died, together with pen portraits of them.
In a statement, relatives of the Stockers said they were keen travellers and still very much in love. It said: �쏷hey were a happy couple, both young at heart, and enjoyed all life could afford. They were frequent flyers and enjoyed travelling to new places and exploring.
�쏪ohn and Janet�셲 home life revolved around the most simplest of pleasures �� family and friends. They died together doing what they enjoyed most �� being side by side.��
They were killed two days before they were due to return home to Surrey and had just arranged dinner with friends so they could end the holiday on a high.
Their friend Anthony Miller, who saw them die, said: �쏧 heard what I thought were firecrackers going off. I looked up and saw the man standing over Janet and John had something in his hands.
�쏧 thought: �쁈 don�셳 believe this is happening.�� It seemed to me he was not very good with the gun. He seemed to have a job controlling it. He was swinging it side to side. I am not sure how many times they had been shot. They must have been the first to be shot. They didn�셳 stand a chance.��
In his statement, Miller said he knew his wife, Julie, would not be able to run, so he pushed her down into the sand, lay on top of her and told her to play dead.
Trudy Jones, a carer and grandmother-of-eight from Blackwood in south Wales, was on holiday with friends. Her friend Carol Anne Powell said she went to sit by the pool after breakfast while Jones went to the beach to sunbathe.
Powell said: �쏛t around 12 or 12.30pm, I heard the most terrible explosion. The explosion came from behind me, towards the beach area. It was the loudest noise you could ever hear.��
She initially thought it was an explosion in a beach kitchen but then crowds of people appeared, running away from the area.
�쏧 wanted to run towards the beach to check on Trudy, but people were running towards me shouting �쁆o, go��. I started to run towards the hotel with the crowds of people.�� Powell eventually decided to play dead in a hotel car park.
In the following days, Powell attended the mortuary where the victims�� bodies were being held. She recognised her friend because of the glittery nail varnish on her toes. Her identity was later confirmed through dental records.
Jones�셲 family described her as a loving mother, grandmother, sister and daughter. Their statement said: �쏶he was a beautiful person inside and out. She would put everyone�셲 happiness before her own. Making others happy made her happy. You only had to meet her once and you would never forget her. She was an amazing lady. The world was a much better place with her in it. Truly one of a kind.��
Another member of the party, Mark Hornby, said he had not been aware of the terror threat in Tunisia. In his statement, he said: �쏧 did not check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website as I was not aware of it. The terror risk was not brought to our attention by Thomson [the holiday company]. I assumed we would be safe on our holiday, especially as the hotel was five stars.��
Survivor Simon Greaves sobbed as his statement was read out. He described diving behind a sun lounger for cover and finding a man who had been hit and was shouting: �쏧�셶e been shot, you fucking bastards.��
Greaves added: �쏧 saw male one [Rezgui] standing over someone. I heard a single shot, like an execution.��
The thriving metropolis of Boston was turned into a ghost town on Friday. Nearly a million Bostonians were asked to stay in their homes �� and willingly complied. Schools were closed; business shuttered; trains, subways and roads were empty; usually busy streets eerily resembled a post-apocalyptic movie set; even baseball games and cultural events were cancelled �� all in response to a 19-year-old fugitive, who was on foot and clearly identified by the news media.
The actions allegedly committed by the Boston marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, were heinous. Four people dead and more than 100 wounded, some with shredded and amputated limbs.
But Londoners, who endured IRA terror for years, might be forgiven for thinking that America over-reacted just a tad to the goings-on in Boston. They're right �� and then some. What we saw was a collective freak-out like few that we've seen previously in the United States. It was yet another depressing reminder that more than 11 years after 9/11 Americans still allow themselves to be easily and willingly cowed by the "threat" of terrorism.
After all, it's not as if this is the first time that homicidal killers have been on the loose in a major American city. In 2002, Washington DC was terrorised by two roving snipers, who randomly shot and killed 10 people. In February, a disgruntled police officer, Christopher Dorner, murdered four people over several days in Los Angeles. In neither case was LA or DC put on lockdown mode, perhaps because neither of these sprees was branded with that magically evocative and seemingly terrifying word for Americans, terrorism.
To be sure, public officials in Boston appeared to be acting out of an abundance of caution. And it's appropriate for Boston residents to be asked to take precautions or keep their eyes open. But by letting one fugitive terrorist shut down a major American city, Boston not only bowed to outsize and irrational fears, but sent a dangerous message to every would-be terrorist �� if you want to wreak havoc in the United States, intimidate its population and disrupt public order, here's your instruction booklet.
Putting aside the economic and psychological cost, the lockdown also prevented an early capture of the alleged bomber, who was discovered after Bostonians were given the all clear and a Watertown man wandered into his backyard for a cigarette and found a bleeding terrorist on his boat.
In some regards, there is a positive spin on this �� it's a reflection of how little Americans have to worry about terrorism. A population such as London during the IRA bombings or Israel during the second intifada or Baghdad, pretty much every day, becomes inured to random political violence. Americans who have such little experience of terrorism, relatively speaking, are more primed to overreact �� and assume the absolute worst when it comes to the threat of a terror attack. It is as if somehow in the American imagination, every terrorist is a not just a mortal threat, but is a deadly combination of Jason Bourne and James Bond.
If only Americans reacted the same way to the actual threats that exist in their country. There's something quite fitting and ironic about the fact that the Boston freak-out happened in the same week the Senate blocked consideration of a gun control bill that would have strengthened background checks for potential buyers. Even though this reform is supported by more than 90% of Americans, and even though 56 out of 100 senators voted in favour of it, the Republican minority prevented even a vote from being held on the bill because it would have allegedly violated the second amendment rights of "law-abiding Americans".
So for those of you keeping score at home �� locking down an American city: a proper reaction to the threat from one terrorist. A background check to prevent criminals or those with mental illness from purchasing guns: a dastardly attack on civil liberties. All of this would be almost darkly comic if not for the fact that more Americans will die needlessly as a result. Already, more than 30,000 Americans die in gun violence every year (compared to the 17 who died last year in terrorist attacks).
What makes US gun violence so particularly horrifying is how routine and mundane it has become. After the massacre of 20 kindergartners in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, millions of Americans began to take greater notice of the threat from gun violence. Yet since then, the daily carnage that guns produce has continued unabated and often unnoticed.
The same day of the marathon bombing in Boston, 11 Americans were murdered by guns. The pregnant Breshauna Jackson was killed in Dallas, allegedly by her boyfriend. In Richmond, California, James Tucker III was shot and killed while riding his bicycle �� assailants unknown. Nigel Hardy, a 13-year-old boy in Palmdale, California, who was being bullied in school, took his own life. He used the gun that his father kept at home. And in Brooklyn, New York, an off-duty police officer used her department-issued Glock 9mm handgun to kill herself, her boyfriend and her one-year old child.
At the same time that investigators were in the midst of a high-profile manhunt for the marathon bombers that ended on Friday evening, 38 more Americans �� with little fanfare �� died from gun violence. One was a 22-year old resident of Boston. They are a tiny percentage of the 3,531 Americans killed by guns in the past four months �� a total that surpasses the number of Americans who died on 9/11 and is one fewer than the number of US soldiers who lost their lives in combat operations in Iraq. Yet, none of this daily violence was considered urgent enough to motivate Congress to impose a mild, commonsense restriction on gun purchasers.
It's not just firearms that produce such legislative inaction. Last week, a fertiliser plant in West, Texas, which hasn't been inspected by federal regulators since 1985, exploded, killing 14 people and injuring countless others. Yet many Republicans want to cut further the funding for the agency (OSHA) that is responsible for such reviews. The vast majority of Americans die from one of four ailments �� cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease �� and yet Republicans have held three dozen votes to repeal Obamacare, which expands healthcare coverage to 30 million Americans.
It is a surreal and difficult-to-explain dynamic. Americans seemingly place an inordinate fear on violence that is random and unexplainable and can be blamed on "others" �� jihadists, terrorists, evil-doers etc. But the lurking dangers all around us �� the guns, our unhealthy diets, the workplaces that kill 14 Americans every single day �� these are just accepted as part of life, the price of freedom, if you will. And so the violence goes, with more Americans dying preventable deaths. But hey, look on the bright side �� we got those sons of bitches who blew up the marathon.
The threat will also lead to extra policing at New Year's Day football matches. Security sources have warned that a Hogmanay festival and similar events provide ideal soft targets for terrorists.
Edinburgh, which runs Europe's largest New Year festival, is seen as particularly vulnerable. Cars loaded with explosives could conceivably be parked near barriers marking off street parties, where tens of thousands of people with special passes will gather in the city centre to see in 2003.
Terrorism expert Paul Beaver says large social gatherings like the celebrations in the Scottish capital or central London's celebrations could be prime targets. 'Public holidays are a favourite for terrorist groups. They know large groups of people will congregate and will be relaxed.
'Cynically, they also know such an attack would get huge news coverage. We know the al-Qaeda network has no concerns about taking large numbers of civilian lives and likes to go for soft targets. Scotland comes into this category because its authorities, while highly competent, are not up to speed when it comes to dealing with terrorism.'
The extra security measures come as police try to play down the significance of the arrest of three Algerians in Edinburgh just before Christmas under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Civic leaders fear increasing speculation about an attack in Scotland could lead to a poorer than expected Hogmanay turnout. Edinburgh's four-day celebration is one of the world's biggest and is estimated to boost the local economy by 짙36 million.
More than 100,000 revellers are expected, lured by such highlights as a huge concert on Hogmanay, the Night Afore Fiesta tomorrow night and the traditional Torchlight Procession and Fire Festival, which will kick off the festivities today. Culture Club and Ms Dynamite are among the top acts due to perform.
Although Lothian and Borders police insist there is no evidence that anywhere in Scotland, let alone Edinburgh, is a terrorist target, the timing of the arrests and the fact that all the suspects - and four more people arrested in London on the same day - are now being held in Scotland has led many to conclude that the celebrations are indeed threatened.
The fact that four of the men were initially arrested in London and that all had once been based there has raised fears that similar attacks may have been planned for revellers in Trafalgar Square.
A City of Edinburgh Council spokesman said: 'We have not been alerted to any specific threat. We are open for business and looking forward to a fantastic Hogmanay.'
The three arrested men had moved to Edinburgh from west London last September. They were picked up in an operation, planned for two months, and co-ordinated by the Lothian and Borders police backed by MI5 and the Metropolitan force.
All seven men appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Christmas Eve, arriving in a police convoy with a helicopter escort. All of them were remanded in custody for another week. The hearing took place in a closed court, and no further details of the charges or circumstances surrounding the arrests were released.
The prospect of a New Year attack echoes past plans to attack targets, including the Dome on London's Greenwich peninsula. In the run-up to the Millennium celebrations, the highlight of which was a massive, celebrity-studded party at the Dome, it emerged that the Real IRA had placed the structure on a list of mainland targets.
Tensions are running far higher than normal now because of the threat of war in Iraq, and the security services are concerned about the prospect of an attack during the holiday season.
Tony Blair has warned repeatedly of possible terrorist attacks over the festive period, and called on the public to be vigilant in spotting abandoned packages and to combine this with the courage to ward off the economic damage that can be caused by fear.
�쏛ung San Suu Kyii would like to help the Bengali, but I block her,�� says Ashin Wirathu with some pride.
Branded the �쏤ace of Buddhist Terror�� by Time magazine, Wirathu has his own compound within the Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay. Before being offered a comfortable chair, visitors are greeted by a wall of bloody and gruesome photographs.
The pictures show machete-inflicted head wounds and severed limbs, disfigured faces and slashed bodies; Wirathu claims, without the slightest evidence, that the images are of Buddhists who were attacked by Muslims.
Next to the display, under which a monk is methodically sweeping the floor, stands a long table. The newspapers spread across it confirm that, for Wirathu�셲 followers, daily reading is a matter not just of spiritual texts but also of politics.
An orange-robed assistant adjusts a film camera on to a tripod; another brandishes a Nikon fitted with a large zoom lens. This interview will be carefully recorded by the monks in every way.
Wirathu is a man of unassuming features. His baby face belies the power he holds over nationalist activists in Myanmar as the spiritual leader of the 969 movement and head of Ma Ba Tha, the Organisation for the Protection of Race and Religion.
Wirathu perches on one of two teak armchairs; the wall to his left is covered with poster-sized photographs of him. He stands accused of inciting violence against the minority Muslim population in Myanmar, where racial and religious faultlines are increasingly exposed. In 2012, fuelled by his speeches, riots erupted in Meiktila, a city in central Myanmar, leaving a mosque burned to the ground and over a hundred dead.
In a soft and measured voice, Wirathu claims his speeches are neither �쐆ate�� nor racist, but serve merely as a warning to protect his people. What people make of those warnings is not his doing, he says calmly.
�쏧 am defending my loved one,�� he says, �쐋ike you would defend your loved one. I am only warning people about Muslims. Consider it like if you had a dog, that would bark at strangers coming to your house �� it is to warn you. I am like that dog. I bark.��
Wirathu speaks of protecting his flock �� �쐆is beloved�� �� against what he perceives as danger. His denial of responsibility for the violence that has followed his sermons contrasts with eyewitness accounts of knife-wielding monks, denim jeans visible under their robes, leaving Wirathu�셲 monastery during the Mandalay riots of 2013.
Islam represents only 5% of Myanmar�셲 population of 54 million, but nationalists like Wirathu are pushing the idea that the faith puts Buddhism, and the very essence of Myanmar, in jeopardy. He claims the 1 million Rohingya Muslims living in precarious conditions in his country �� described by human rights agencies as the most persecuted people on Earth �� �쐂on�셳 exist��.
�쏧t only takes one terrorist to be amongst them,�� he says. �쏬ook at what has happened in the west. I do not want that to happen in my country. All I am doing is warning people to beware.��
Wirathu adds that if Donald Trump or Nigel Farage need some advice he will happily share his ideas. These include infiltrating the Facebook pages of Muslim groups, getting all Islamic schools to record their lessons, and government surveillance of internet activity, including emails. Wirathu claims he has his own army of individuals screening the net in Myanmar.
On the well-documented situation of the Rohingya in Rakhine state �� where people have been left without access to medicines, aid, and basic human necessities such as clean water, sanitation and food �� Wirathu is dismissive. The Rohingya have been mostly couped up in camps since the 2012 violence, and the silence of Myanmar�셲 leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy on their plight has attracted growing criticism.
Wirathu rejects the stateless Rohingya as illegal immigrants, a view echoed by the government. He will only discuss them if the description �쏝angladeshis�� is used, and even then Wirashu says the situation is not as it is portrayed.
�쏧f it is true what [outsiders say], then I would offer help but I have visited the camps on many occasions. The aid agencies are refused access because they are using the refugees to fill their own pockets. Bangladeshis are posing for the media. They are not starving. They have so much food that they are selling it on in their shops �� stealing even from their own.��
On the allegations that women have been abused and raped by the military, he laughed: �쏧mpossible. Their bodies are too disgusting.��
There have been calls outside Myanmar for Aung San Suu Kyi to return her Nobel peace prize for her failure to tackle the situation with the refugees, which has broken her own promises on human rights.
Wirathu points to four soldiers marching through the compound, joking that they are there to arrest him, again. In 2003, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his anti-islamic sermons, but was released nine years later. In the event, the soldiers are there simply to make donations to his cause.
Wirathu is confident that the power of Ma Ba Tha is far from dwindling; that the organisation represents Myanmar Buddhism and its influence over the government is entrenched.
As a passing mosquito wins his empathy, he switches from his anti-Muslim rhetoric to explain: �쏧 can teach you how to be a better Buddhist and not kill the mosquito. First, you must have compassion for the mosquito, imagine it to need you as it has no family to feed it. Second, you must try to put yourself in its place.��
Isis feeds first on state dysfunction, second on Sunni outrage. In혻Iraq, Sunni Arabs are a minority displaced from their privileged position by America�셲 invasion. Their revanchism is exacerbated by the sectarian oppression practised by the elected but Iranian-backed government. In Syria, Sunnis are an oppressed majority, the prime targets of a counter-revolutionary tyranny headed by mafias but claiming and exploiting Alawi sectarian identity.
Under other names, Isis first grew in혻Iraq, as it would later in Syria, by exploiting resistance to occupation, American in the first case, that of a delegitimised regime in the other. Drawing on research by the Guardian�셲 Martin Chulov, Michael Weiss and Hassan Hassan show how Syria�셲 regime once collaborated with Iraqi Baathists and Salafist extremists, helping terrorists move to American-occupied Iraq, where their attacks against Shia civilians eventually precipitated civil war. This troublemaking was President Assad�셲 message to the US to leave his regime alone.
Eventually the jihadists were driven혻out of Iraq by the US-backed Awakening Movement. Their moment returned in혻2013, when the Iraqi government repressed peaceful Sunni혻protests with혻live fire. Heading a혻Baathist-Islamist coalition, Isis then captured huge swathes of the country and set혻about its reign of terror.
Weiss and Hassan have produced a혻detailed and readable book. Their informants include American and regional military officials and intelligence operatives, defected Syrian spies and diplomats, and �� most fascinating of all �� Syrians who work for Isis (these are divided into categories such as politickers, pragmatists, opportunists and fence-sitters). The authors provide useful insights into Isis governance �� a combination of divide-and-rule, indoctrination and fear �� and are well placed for the task. Hassan, an expert on tribal and jihadist dynamics, is from Syria�셲 east. Weiss reported from liberated al-Bab, outside Aleppo, before Isis took it over.
Cockburn�셲 book is more polemic than analysis. While Weiss and Hassan give a sense of the vital civil movements that coincide with jihadism and Assadism in Syria, Cockburn sees only an opposition that �쐓hoots children in the face for minor blasphemy��. He concedes the first revolutionaries wanted democracy, but still talks of �쐔he uprising of the Sunni in Syria in 2011��. By 2014, he writes, �쐔he armed opposition�� to Assad was �쐂ominated by Isis��. Yet from January 2014, in response to popular pressure, every Syrian oppositional militia declared war against Isis, pushed it out of the north-west, and weakened it in its eastern strongholds. They gave hundreds of lives in this battle. Compare the success of these �쐄armers and dentists�� (as Barack Obama disparagingly called them) to the failure of the US-trained Iraqi army, which in June fled from a small Isis force in Mosul. Isis brought the American weapons it captured to bear on Syria, and surged back to the areas it had lost.
For Cockburn, Sunni jihadism is an essence without context. The war on terror failed, he says, because it didn�셳 fully engage with Sunni states such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He blames �� rightly �� Saudi Arabia�셲 Wahhabi ideology, a form of Islamism �쐔hat imposes sharia law�� for the ideological background from which Isis arises. Repeatedly he uses the comparison of혻Sunni jihadists to Nazis and Shia to혻Jews. He is almost silent, however, on the more immediate background.
For him, it is the Syrian opposition that �쐆as allowed or encouraged the conflict to become a vicious sectarian war��. He doesn�셳 consider that Assad might have had something to do with it, by sending Alawi death squads into Sunni villages to murder and rape, or by releasing violent Salafists from prison in 2011 at the same time he was targeting secular, peaceful activists for detention and assassination. Nor does혻he blame the Iranian-backed Shia jihadist militias from Lebanon and Iraq who fight on Assad�셲 frontlines.
Cockburn exaggerates western support of the Syrian opposition, when the Americans�� main role was to prevent Arab states from sending the heavy weaponry Syrians so desperately needed to resist Assad�셲 blitzkrieg. One justification given by commentators for the failure to support the Free Army early on was that Islamists might benefit. Of course, the opposite happened �� starved for funds, guns and ammunition, the moderate leadership was unable to win loyalty, or establish central control and discipline. Many of혻its fighters either despaired and left혻the country or gravitated towards the much better-funded Islamist brigades. Unhindered, Assad�셲 barrel bombs and scuds implemented a scorched-earth strategy, traumatising Syrians and producing a vacuum in which jihadism flourished.
Cockburn has conducted no interviews with Isis fighters. His informants tend to be government officials or those steered into his path by these officials, ranging from �쐎ne senior Iraqi source�� to �쏿n intelligence officer from a Middle East country neighbouring Syria��. Unlike Cockburn, I have visited liberated parts of Syria unembedded, and have maintained contacts with democratic activists who oppose, and are targeted by, both Assad and Isis.
Increasingly a deluded �쐒ealism�� calls for cooperation with Assad against the greater jihadist enemy. It was precisely in order to provoke these calls that Assad did his utmost to create a jihadist threat, and why �� until June 2014, when Isis became a threat to his regime �� he refrained from bombing the organisation. Even today, when the혻Free Army and Isis fight, Assad bombs the Free Army. Former State Department official Fred Hof describes the unofficial Isis-Assad collusion like this: �쏷heir top tactical priority in Syria is identical: destroy the Syrian nationalist opposition.��

Theresa May declared �쐃nough is enough�� as she announced plans to introduce new anti-terror laws in the wake of the London Bridge attack.
Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister warned there had been �쐄ar too much tolerance of extremism�� in the UK, as she promised a review of counter-terrorism strategy and said new international agreements must be introduced to regulate the internet.
But critics accused her of politicising the atrocity in breach of an agreement to halt the general election campaign.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the prime minister on Sunday night of trying to �쐏rotect the public on the cheap�� by implementing 20,000 police cuts.
The attack in the centre of the capital in which seven people were killed came just days before Thursday�셲 general election with the polls in flux. Six separate polls over the weekend showed a Tory lead over Labour of between one and 12 percentage points.
In her address, following a Cobra emergency meeting, May said that internet companies must not allow extremism a place to exist.
�쏻e cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed �� yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide,�� she said.
�쏻e need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements to regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorism planning,�� she said.
Her comments followed the decision by the Conservatives, Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats to suspend election campaigning until Sunday night.
The prime minister suggested there could be increased prison terms for terrorism offences, even relatively minor ones.
Islamist militancy was the thread that linked the otherwise unconnected recent attacks in London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester, she said.
�쏧t is an ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth,�� she said. �쏡efeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time. But it cannot be defeated through military intervention alone.��
May said the recent spate of attacks showed the UK was �쐃xperiencing a new trend in the threat we face��.
Action was needed in the UK as well as overseas, she added. �쏻hile we have made significant progress in recent years, there is �� to be frank �� far too much tolerance of extremism in our country.��
She said that campaigning would resume and the election would still take place on 8 June.
The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, formerly London�셲 mayor, echoed May�셲 words. He said: �쏷he wells of tolerance are running empty.��
It is the second terrorism-related suspension of the campaign. It stopped for three days after the suicide bomb attack in Manchester, on 22 May, which killed 22 people.
In a sharp attack upon May�셲 anti-terror credentials, Labour�셲 leader questioned why the police had faced dramatic cuts under her six-year tenure as home secretary and promised to recruit another 10,000 officers and 1,000 security service agents.
�쏽ou cannot protect the public on the cheap. The police and security services must get the resources they need, not 20,000 police cuts,�� he said. �쏷heresa May was warned by the Police Federation but she accused them of �쁟rying wolf��.��
Corbyn moved to quell fears that he would not authorise a shoot-to-kill policy after a 2015 interview clip from the BBC was used to cast doubts upon his use of the policy over recent weeks.
He told an audience in Carlisle: �쏧 will take whatever action is necessary and effective to protect the security of our people and our country. That includes full authority for the police to use whatever force is necessary to protect and save life as they did last night.��
He took a further swipe at the Conservatives�� close alliance with Saudi Arabia and called for a clampdown on the funding of Islamist organisations in the UK.
�쏻e do need to have some difficult conversations starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology,�� he said.
Corbyn questioned why, as disclosed by Guardian, May had failed to publish a report commissioned by David Cameron into funding of jihadi groups which is thought to focus on Saudi Arabia.
The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said May�셲 statement on Sunday morning appeared to be a breach of an agreement with Labour to put aside political campaigning.
Thornberry told BBC Radio 4�셲 The World This Weekend that the statement was insensitive to the needs of those who were just becoming aware that their loved ones had died.
She said: �쏯one of the things [May] is proposing in the four-point plan are immediate steps and so I regret the timing of this.
�쏧 think that [what May has said] is drawing us into a debate. To come out on to the steps of 10 Downing Street immediately in the aftermath of a terrible outrage would not be something that would be expected. We need to do more but we also need to be sensitive to the fact that there are people who are only just discovering that their loved ones have died.��
May is expected to introduce control orders for terror suspects. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory work and pensions secretary, told The World this Weekend that she would probably try to toughen up terrorism, prevention and investigation measures, known as Tpims.
These are the measures introduced by the coalition to place restrictions on people who are suspected of being terrorists but who have not been convicted of an offence.
Duncan Smith said: �쏰ne of the things that I was concerned about in coalition [government] �� I know Theresa May was when she was home secretary �� was during the coalition the Tpim order that we brought in, which gives those powers, was watered down. And I think it was weakened too much.��
The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile of Berriew, predicted that the first item on the agenda in any review would be the reintroduction �� possibly under a new name �� of control orders, which were replaced by the less stringent Tpims in 2011.
There were few clues in the Conservative manifesto about any new powers which may be offered to the police or security agencies. It stated that a Tory government would �쐁ontinue to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our counter-terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad��.
The foreign secretary, David Miliband, today argues that the use of the "war on terror" as a western rallying cry since the September 11 attacks has been a mistake that may have caused "more harm than good".
In an article in today's Guardian, five days before the Bush administration leaves the White House, Miliband delivers a comprehensive critique of its defining mission, saying the war on terror was misconceived and that the west cannot "kill its way" out of the threats it faces.
British officials quietly stopped using the phrase "war on terror" in 2006, but this is the first time it has been comprehensively discarded in the most outspoken remarks on US counterterrorism strategy to date by a British minister.
In remarks that were also made in a speech today in Mumbai, in one of the hotels that was a target of terrorist attacks in November, the foreign secretary says the concept of a war on terror is "misleading and mistaken".
"Historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good," Miliband says, adding that, in his opinion, the whole strategy has been dangerously counterproductive, helping otherwise disparate groups find common cause against the west.
"The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists or good and evil, the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common," Miliband argues, in a clear reference to the signature rhetoric of the Bush era. "We should expose their claim to a compelling and overarching explanation and narrative as the lie that it is."
"Terrorism is a deadly tactic, not an institution or an ideology," he says.
He argues that "the war on terror implied a belief that the correct response to the terrorist threat was primarily a military one - to track down and kill a hardcore of extremists". But he quotes an American commander, General David Petraeus, saying the western coalition in Iraq "could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife".
Instead of trying to build western solidarity against a shared enemy, Miliband argues it should be constructed instead on the "idea of who we are and the values we share".
He goes on to say that "democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating. It is an argument he links directly with the Guant찼namo Bay detention camp. "That is surely the lesson of Guant찼namo and it is why we welcome president-elect Obama's clear commitment to close it."
After the al-Qaida attacks of 11 September 2001, the Bush administration presented the threat of a global terrorist onslaught as justification for pre-emptive military action, long-term detention without trial and severe interrogation techniques widely denounced by human rights groups as torture. The incoming Obama administration is expected to avoid using the term "war on terror" and adopt a more multilateral and less military-focused approach to global threats.
British officials are signalling, in increasingly public ways, that they cannot wait for the new team to take office next Tuesday, and wave goodbye to an eight-year administration with which they felt increasingly ill at ease, particularly following the departure of Tony Blair in 2007.
Miliband said last night that the incoming administration's proposed use of "smart power" meshed with his arguments. "The new administration has a set of values that fit very well with the values and priorities I am talking about," he said during a visit to Amethi, northern India.
Asked whether he had not left it late in the Bush era to make his criticism, the foreign secretary said British officials had stopped thinking in terms of a single war on terror more than two years ago, and had been putting a "more comprehensive approach" into practice.
British officials said the timing of the speech was dictated more by the Mumbai attacks than Bush's departure, but added that the transition in Washington meant the language could be less cautious than it might otherwise have been.
UK-US relations have been particular sour in recent days after Washington reneged on a pledge to back a largely British-drafted UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The White House over-ruled US diplomats after a demand from the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert.
Protocol went out of the window as the 60 world leaders congregated in Paris on Sunday to show their support and solidarity with France after a week of terrorist bloodshed that left 17 dead.
In an event unprecedented in the history of modern France, nobody was standing on ceremony. Presidents, prime ministers, statesmen and women travelled by bus to join a largely silent march to honour the victims and heroes of the three attacks, and to show that they would not be bowed.
They stood in a line, some of the most powerful people on earth, jostling for space in the Paris boulevard named after Voltaire, the French writer whose name is synonymous with freedom of expression.
The crowd around them was estimated to number more than 1 million, under the watchful eye of 2,200 heavily armed police and gendarmes, including crack snipers on the surrounding roofs, and helicopters.
The straggly line then set off, arm in arm, the French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, in the centre, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to his left. To his right, Ibrahim Boubacar K챘ita, the president of Mali, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and David Cameron, the UK prime minister.
�쁗e are walking together, as one Europe, Africa, the Middle East against terrorism�� was the message.
As they marched, the crowds that lined the route broke into spontaneous cheers and applause.
The dignitaries had followed the families of the victims of Wednesday�셲 attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo magazine that left 12 people dead, the police officer shot on Thursday in Montrouge and the families of the four Jewish shoppers who died in an attack on a Kosher supermarket in Vincennes on Friday, who led the march.
Staff of the magazine, wearing white headbands bearing the name �쏞harlie��, wept. Onlookers wept. Journalists wept.
In the leading cortege, tears streamed down faces, riven with the grief and shock of the last few days. Hands clutched hands and the most distraught needed support as they made their way towards Place de la Nation.
In emotional scenes, Hollande hugged the family and friends of those who died, moving from Charlie Hebdo staff and relatives of the police officers who were gunned down to the families of the supermarket victims.
Leaders of all the religions followed behind a banner proclaiming �쏻e are Charlie��.
While the occasion was heavy with symbolism, a group of Paris students expressed fears that the march would be exploited for political ends because of the presence of so many world leaders. �쏷his isn�셳 a demonstration, it�셲 a rally to show solidarity and unity,�� said Claire Guerini, a medical student.
Her friend, Camille Le Bot, a dance student, said: �쏻e�셱e worried about political manipulation. We�셱e here to say that what happened was extremely grave and that we�셱e not afraid.��
Many of the crowd wore �쏪e suis Charlie�� badges, some carried flags and placards. A young boy held up a banner reading: �쏬ater I will be a journalist. I�셫 not afraid!��
The explicit accusation is contained in a draft report to a parliamentary commission on terrorism.
The formerly communist LDP is the biggest party in Giuliano Amato's centre-left government, and the report could sour relations between Italy and the United States and unleash a storm of domestic political controversy.
The 300-page report says that the United States was responsible for inspiring a "strategy of tension" in which indiscriminate bombing of the public and the threat of a rightwing coup were used to stabilise centre-right political control of the country.
Those who carried out the attacks were rarely caught, it said, because "those massacres, those bombs, those military actions had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States intelligence".
Valter Bielli, a Left Democrat member of parliament and one of the authors of the report, said his party's conclusions were based on recent judicial discoveries and a re-elaboration of information that had been available for many years but had not been adequately understood.
"I am convinced that the intervention of the Americans in Italy is now a historically proven fact," he said.
"They interfered to prevent the Communist party from achieving power by democratic means. The communist threat no longer exists and it would be appropriate if the Americans themselves helped us to clarify what happened in the past."
Mr Bielli said he was worried about the possible implications of the report for relations between Italy and the US, but he hoped it would contribute to the creation of a new Nato in which all countries enjoyed equal weight and dignity.
"During the cold war the east was under communist domination, but the west too had become, in a certain sense, an American colony," he said.
The report claims that US intelligence agents were informed in advance about several rightwing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.
It also alleges that Pino Rauti, a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo (new order) subversive organ isation, received regular funding from a press officer at the US embassy in Rome.
"So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome," the report says.
Mr Rautinow heads the small rightwing MSI Fiamma-Tricolore party, and suggestions that he and other rightwing politicians still actively involved in parliamentary politics had failed to cut their links to terrorist extremists have drawn furious rebuttals from the centre-right opposition.
The National Alliance leader, Gianfranco Fini, described the document as a "miserable report" and the centrist Republican party said it was worthy of a 1970s Maoist group.
"These are allegations that have come up over the last 20 years and there is absolutely nothing to them," a source at the US embassy in Rome said.
To Aldo Giannuli, a historian who works as a consultant to the parliamentary terrorism commission, the release of the Left Democrats' report is a manoeuvre dictated primarily by domestic political considerations.
"Since they have been in power the Left Democrats have given us very little help in gaining access to security service archives," he said.
"This is a falsely courageous report. The real issue today is gaining access to Nato's archives. There has been no impulse on this front from the government."
Theresa May�셲 Downing Street statement on Sunday morning, condemning the �쐃vil ideology of Islamist extremism�� and laying out her four-point plan for action follows a pattern that seems increasingly familiar.
The prime minister placed much emphasis on extremist ideology among a small minority of Muslims �� a cornerstone of the government�셲 counter-terror strategy. But this narrative has little to say about the proclaimed motivations of the terrorists themselves, who often express far more tangible goals.
For example, Islamic State hailed the Manchester attack as a response to Britain�셲 �쐔ransgressions against the lands of the Muslims��, a victory against �쐔he crusaders�� of the west and a response to airstrikes in Iraq. Of course, these attackers would gladly ban concerts and close bars, but their primary motivation has �� from the very creation of Isis �� been to create a pseudo �쏧slamic state�� in the Middle East.
Attacking European nations or the United States was never Isis�셲 raison d�쇒챫re. But as coalition forces have gradually dismantled the strongholds that provided the group with a modicum of authority in the eyes of its supporters, strikes in western cities have consistently been claimed as a response to this.
This isn�셳 to suggest the territorial fightback against Isis should not be pursued �� it is simply that we have to recognise that the fate of European capitals is tied up with a very real war taking place in the Middle East. British foreign policy, whether you agree or disagree with its direction, is reverberating on British soil. And here it mixes with the underbelly that exists in all societies: the marginalised, the angry, the alienated; those looking for a higher cause to bring meaning to an often dead-end existence.
And as long as the UK is involved �� rightly or wrongly �� in military actions in the Middle East, there is likely to be violent blowback on home soil. The intelligence services have been clear: although they have thwarted many attacks, they won�셳 be able to stop all of them.
So the notion that the real problem is a set of ideas being pushed in the murky underground of the Muslim community is false. In fact, intelligence analysts are at pains to highlight that families �� let alone the nebulous notion of �쐔he community�� �� are often the last to know. And when they have had suspicions, recent cases have shown that families and mosques have approached the authorities. Communities work, and will continue to work, with the police to stop those who wish to harm us all.
But this relationship of trust and cooperation is made harder, not easier, when the government casts a wide net of suspicion over the entire Muslim community. To begin a conversation about counter-terrorism, as May did on Sunday, with the proposal that people (read Muslims) simply need to be better educated about �쏝ritish values�� is to cast terrorism as first and foremost a problem of social cohesion.
It suggests the entire Muslim community is a suspect group that needs to be inoculated, through the injection of a predetermined set of ethics �� as imagined by the superior mind of May and her cohorts �� to protect them from themselves. The days of empire may be long gone, but the notion that the barbarians at the gates need to be civilised is clearly alive and well.
The truth is that British values are no superior to those of any other nation. The very conversation is patronising to anyone of non-British origin. What�셲 the reasoning, exactly? If only these men had read a little more Jane Austen, they couldn�셳 possibly have considered the prospect of mass murder? Improving social cohesion is a laudable objective �� but linking terrorism to integration produces a dangerous confusion over the roots of the problem, which ultimately stigmatises and alienates some of the poorest communities in this혻country.
In her speech, May repeated the point that terrorist ideology is derived from a �쐏erversion of Islam��. While this may be true, we�셱e in 2017, not 2001. Almost 16 years into this threat, it�셲 time to change the record. The statement that this has nothing to do with Islam, reiterated after each attack, seems not only trite but counterproductive. How many more times does this need to be stated: terrorists are not motivated by the faith of the 1.6 billion regular folk walking this planet; Muslims aren�셳 immune to bombs and bullets.
Muslims experience a double penalty in such attacks: the same trauma as all other citizens, plus the guilt cloud that hangs over each of us thereafter. How about not repeating this same toxic conversation after each attack? Because, frankly, there is a point at which it appears almost like the caveat after which the bashing can begin.
What the government could do however is be honest about the risks to domestic security of foreign military interventions �� risks the public may or may not wish to accept. It can invest heavily in the security services working to keep the country safe. This means more resources, but it also means not creating a climate of suspicion around Muslims, who, like everyone else, are partners in the common goal of preserving life �� incidentally, the highest of values in Islamic law. Creating dichotomies between British and Islamic values only feeds a toxic narrative.
The aftermath of the recent horrific events shows us that people from all faiths and none, drawing on their diverse value systems, can come together to emphasise love, solidarity and unity. We don�셳 need lessons in British values; but our politicians may need to learn a thing or two about not widening the very divisions they believe to be the problem.
Theresa May personally approved an inquiry into foreign funding of extremism in the UK while home secretary that has still not been published, according to the leader of the Liberal Democrats.
Tim Farron told the Guardian he had received two personal phone calls from the then prime minister, David Cameron, in January 2015 after the Lib Dems made the investigation a condition of their support for extending UK airstrikes in Syria. Cameron committed to publishing the report by spring 2016, Farron said.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, have both challenged May not to shelve the report on foreign support of jihadi groups in the UK.
The investigation believed to focus on Saudi Arabia. The Home Office has suggested it may never be published due to its sensitive nature.
Before the Commons vote on airstrikes in December 2015, when Cameron was canvassing support from rival parties, senior Lib Dems including Farron, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and the former Lib Dem leaders Paddy Ashdown and Menzies Campbell wrote to Cameron with a series of demands.
In the letter, seen by the Guardian, Farron and others wrote: �쏻e call on the government to ... conduct an investigation into foreign funding and support of extremist and terrorist groups in the UK.��
Other conditions in the letter included a commitment to following an international legal framework for military intervention, putting pressure on Gulf states for increased support in the region and for the government to step up its acceptance of unaccompanied Syrian refugee children.
Farron told the Guardian Cameron had phoned him on his mobile on the Sunday before the Syria vote, and the pair had discussed the Lib Dems�� conditions. He said Cameron had told him he would have to discuss the terror funding inquiry with May, then home secretary.
�쏦e rang me back within the hour,�� Farron said. �쏦e made it clear he had spoken to the home secretary and said it would definitely be published. He was not equivocal about it and he had time to speak to May before he rang me back.��
On the following Wednesday, in his speech to the Commons at the debate on extending airstrikes against Islamic State, Cameron said: �쏧 can announce today that we will establish a comprehensive review to root out any remaining funding of extremism within the UK.
�쏷his will examine specifically the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK, including any overseas sources. It will report to myself and my right honourable friend the home secretary next spring.��
Farron said he believed the report had been �쐒epeatedly buried�� despite the guarantees from Cameron. �쏷he Conservatives�� evasion of this critical security issue reveals just how desperate they are to seek post-Brexit trade deals with dodgy regimes like Saudi Arabia,�� he said.
�쏻e cannot allow the safety of our country to be compromised by Tory unwillingness to upset their hardline friends in the Gulf. To stamp out terror, it is critical to know who is funding it. Stop hiding, publish the report.��
On Monday, Labour�셲 Yvette Cooper, a former chair of the home affairs select committee, joined calls for the report�셲 delay to be explained.
�쏷heresa May should explain what on earth has happened to this report,�� she said. �쏧t is too important to hide or kick into the long grass. Under no circumstances should we be permitting foreign funding of extremism in the UK �� whether it be Saudi funding or anywhere else.��
In a speech in Carlisle on Sunday evening, Corbyn challenged the prime minister over the delayed report, referencing May�셲 speech after the London Bridge terror attack on Saturday, in which she said challenging terrorism would �쐒equire some difficult and often embarrassing conversations��.
Corbyn said: �쏽es, we do need to have some difficult conversations, starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology.
�쏧t is no good Theresa May suppressing a report into the foreign funding of extremist groups. We have to get serious about cutting off the funding to these terror networks, including Isis here and in the Middle East.��
On Monday, Sturgeon also tweeted that May �쐌ust give a clear commitment�� to publish the report.
The Home Office said the report had not yet been completed and publication was not guaranteed, given the �쐖ery sensitive�� nature of the content. A decision about the future of the investigation would be taken �쏿fter the election by the next government��, a Home Office spokesman said.
The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, told BBC Radio 4�셲 Today programme no decisions had been made about the future of the report and said it was not complete.
�쏷he important point is we work with our partners and allies, and we save far more lives by working together,�� she said. �쏻e have, through all our diplomatic relations, honest conversations with our friends.
�쏻e need to work with our friends and with our allies to make sure we share intelligence. To suggest we�셱e not taking terrorist financing seriously is simply ridiculous.��
�쏷he hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident which everybody has decided not to see,�� wrote Ayn Rand in her novel The Fountainhead. That there is a link, a connection, between the west�셲 military interventions in the Middle East and terrorist attacks against the west, that violence begets violence, is �쐅laringly evident�� to anyone with open eyes, if not open minds.
Yet over the past 14 years, too many of us have �쐂ecided not to see��. From New York to Madrid to London, any public utterance of the words �쐄oreign�� and �쐏olicy�� in the aftermath of a terrorist attack has evoked paroxysms of outrage from politicians and pundits alike.
The response to the atrocities in Paris has followed the same pattern. Derided by a former Labour minister as �쐗est-hating fury chimps��, the UK�셲 Stop the War coalition removed from its website a piece that blamed the rise of Islamic State (Isis) and the Paris attacks on �쐂eliberate policies and actions undertaken by the United States and its allies��. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, scrapped a speech in which he was due to say that Britain�셲 �쐂isastrous wars�� have �쐇ncreased, not diminished, the threats to our own national security��. Such arguments are verboten in our public discourse.
Isn�셳 it odd, then, that in the case of Russia, western governments have been keen to link Vladimir Putin�셲 �� and only Vladimir Putin�셲 �� foreign policy to terrorist violence? On 1 October the US government and its allies issued a joint statement declaring that the Russian president�셲 decision to intervene in Syria would �쐎nly fuel more extremism and radicalisation��. Yes, you heard them: it�셪l �쐄uel�� it.
Moscow�셲 bombing campaign will �쐋ead to further radicalisation and increased terrorism��, claimed David Cameron on 4 October. Note the words �쐋ead to��. Speaking at a Nato summit on 8 October the US defence secretary, Ashton Carter, warned of the �쐁onsequences for Russia itself, which is rightly fearful of attacks��. Got that? �쏳ightly fearful��.
And, in the days since the crash of the Russian Metrojet airliner in Egypt on 31 October, which killed 224 civilians, commentators have queued up to join the dots between Russia�셲 actions in Syria and this alleged terrorist attack by Isis. On a BBC panel discussion the Telegraph�셲 Janet Daley referred to the crash as �쏿 direct consequence of [Russia�셲] involvement in Syria��, adding: ��[Putin] has perhaps incited this terrorist incident on Russian civilians.��
Compare and contrast Daley�셲 remarks on the downing of Flight 9268 with her reaction to the Paris attacks. Rather than accusing President Hollande of �쐇nciting�� terrorism against the people of France, or calling the carnage a �쐂irect consequence�� of French involvement in Syria, she took aim at anyone who might dare draw attention to the country�셲 military interventions in Muslim-majority countries such as Libya, Mali and, yes, Syria.
�쏧f there is any need to argue about these matters, it should come at some other time,�� she wrote, because �쐔he French people did not deserve this��, and �쐇t is wicked and irresponsible to suggest otherwise��. (To quote one of the leading foreign policy sages of our time, Phoebe Buffay of Friends: �쏦ello, kettle? This is pot. You�셱e black.��)
If Isis did bring down the Russian airliner, then of course it would be madness to pretend it wasn�셳 linked to Putin�셲 military campaign on behalf of the dictator of Damascus. Yet it would be equally insane to pretend that the horror in Paris had nothing at all to do with France�셲 recent military interventions in the Middle East and west Africa.
Yes, the attackers in the Bataclan concert hall chanted Allahu Akbar as they opened fire on the crowd, but they were also heard saying: �쏻hat you are doing in Syria? You are going to pay for it now.�� Yes, Isis�셲 official statement of responsibility referred to Paris as �쐔he capital of prostitution and obscenity��, but it also singled out the French government for leading a �쏞rusader campaign�� and �쐓triking the Muslims �� with their planes��.
To understand political violence requires an understanding of political grievances; to blame terrorism only on religious ideology or medieval mindsets is short-sighted and self-serving. The inconvenient truth is that geopolitics is governed as much as is physics by Newton�셲 third law of motion: �쏤or every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.�� The CIA, back in the 1950s, even coined a term �� �쐀lowback�� �� to describe the unintended negative consequences, for US civilians, of US military operations abroad.
Today, when it comes to Russia, an �쐎fficial enemy��, we understand and embrace the concept of blowback. When it comes to our own countries, to the west, we become the child in the playground, sticking our fingers in our ears and singing �쏬a la la, I can�셳 hear you.��
You can argue that French �� or for that matter UK or US �� military action in the Middle East is a legitimate and unavoidable response to the rise of a terrorist mini-state; but you can�셳 argue that actions don�셳 have consequences.
The former chief of the CIA�셲 Bin Laden Unit, Michael Scheuer, told me in 2011 that �쐏eople are going to ... bomb us because they don�셳 like what we�셶e done��. In an interview for al-Jazeera in July, the retired US general Michael Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from 201315, admitted to me that �쐔he more bombs we drop, that just �� fuels the conflict��.
It is a view backed by the Pentagon�셲 Defence Science Board, which observed as long as ago as 1997: �쏦istorical data show a strong correlation between US involvement in international situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States.��
Let me be clear: to explain is not to excuse; explication is not justification. There is no grievance on earth that can justify the wanton slaughter of innocent men, women and children, in France or anywhere else.
The savagery of Isis is perhaps without parallel in the modern era. But the point is that it did not emerge from nowhere: as the US president himself has conceded, Isis �쐅rew out of our invasion�� of Iraq.
Yet we avert our gaze from the �쐅laringly evident�� and pretend that �쐔hey�� �� the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese �� are attacked for their policies while �쐗e�� �� Europe, the west, the liberal democracies �� are attacked only for our principles. This is the simplistic fantasy, the geopolitical fairytale, that we tell ourselves. It gives us solace and strength in the wake of terrorist atrocities. But it does nothing to stop the next attack.
The investigation into a terrorist attack outside the Houses of Parliament in London is continuing.
Here is what the Guardian has been able to confirm:
In a speech in his Sedgefield constituency, the prime minister warned of the "mortal danger" posed by Islamist terrorists and rogue states acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and insisted that "this is not the time to err on the side of caution".
"We surely have a duty and a right to prevent the threat materialising; and we surely have a responsibility to act when a nation's people are subjected to a regime such as Saddam's," he said.
Mr Blair called for the reform of international law and the UN to allow the elimination of rogue, repressive regimes which might supply terrorists with WMD.
He also dismissed charges that the attorney general's advice on the legality of the war was disputed, calling them an "elaborate smokescreen".
Insisting that Britain invaded Iraq "to enforce compliance with UN resolutions" and not because it had WMD, he suggested that the war was justified even if the Iraq survey group finds no weapons.
He said: "Here is the crux: It is possible that even with all this, nothing would have happened; possible that Saddam would change his ambitions; possible he would develop the WMD but never use it; possible that the terrorists would never get their hands on WMD, whether from Iraq or elsewhere.
"We cannot be certain. But do we want to take the risk? That is the judgment. And my judgment then and now is that the risk of this new global terrorism, and its interaction with states or organisations or individuals proliferating WMD, is one I simply am not prepared to take."
He claimed the attacks of September 11 had "altered crucially the balance of risk", showing as they did that Islamist terrorists were prepared to wage "war without limit".
"From September 11 on, I could see the threat plainly," he said. "Here were terrorists prepared to bring about Armageddon.
"Here were states whose leadership cared for no one but themselves; were often cruel and tyrannical towards their people; and who saw WMD as a means of defending themselves against any attempt, external or internal, to remove them and who, in their chaotic and corrupt state, were in any event porous and irresponsible with neither the will nor capability to prevent terrorists who also hated the west from exploiting their chaos and corruption."
He added: "The global threat to our security was clear. So was our duty: to act to eliminate it."
Mr Blair warned that political disagreement could make the UN paralysed to deal with a "threat we believe is real", and called for the security council to be reformed so that it "represents 21st century reality".
He described the controversy over the attorney general's legal advice on the war as an "elaborate smokescreen to prevent us seeing the real issue: which is not a matter of trust but of judgement".
And he predicted that "once this row dies down, another will take its place, and then another and then another", as "each week brings a fresh attempt to get a new angle that can prove it was all a gigantic conspiracy".
Reacting to the speech, the opposition leaders took diametrically opposed lines, with the Tories giving Mr Blair their support, but the Liberal Democrats dubbing it a "very defensive speech".
Mr Howard said: "I entirely agree with the prime minister that we face a real threat from terrorism and it is vital that we take effective action to deal with that threat.
"Where the government takes effective action to deal with the threat from terrorism, we shall give them our full support."
But the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said in a statement: "This was an astonishingly defensive speech, as the prime minister continues to struggle with issues of trust raised by his decisions over the controversial war in Iraq.
"The military action in Iraq was taken to rid Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction; it was not an action against terrorists. Of course, the prime minister is right when he says that we must concentrate on defeating international terrorism. But he is again deliberately mixing up the two issues.
"If his administration were to sign up to a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes that would be a major departure. I believe many people in this country would be very concerned if Tony Blair thinks he can turn his back on the UN."
Boris Johnson intensified the Conservatives�� personal attacks on Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday, accusing him of siding with Britain�셲 enemies in the fight against terrorism.
�쏤or 30 years, [Corbyn] has been soft and muddle-headed on terror. He has been soft and muddle-headed on defence,�� Johnson said. �쏦e has taken the side of just about every adversary this country has had in my lifetime, from the IRA to Hamas, from Soviet communism to [Argentina�셲] General Galtieri.��
Johnson said he did not mean to draw a comparison between the EU and nefarious regimes and terror organisations. �쏧 don�셳 mean to compare our European friends to any of these people, but it is psychologically impossible to imagine him having the grip or the firmness to get the right Brexit deal for this country,�� he said.
In a series of attacks on the Labour leader, Johnson made several claims which have been strongly denied by the party. �쏪eremy Corbyn [is] at the very best weak and vacillating on terror. He says he�셲 now in favour of shoot-to-kill,�� Johnson said. �쏦e wasn�셳 until the events of the weekend. I do not see how we can trust him with the safety of our country.��
However, Corbyn has repeatedly said he is in favour of the action police took to neutralise the three terrorists who attacked bystanders in London Bridge on Saturday night.
In a BBC interview last year, where he said he was �쐍ot happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general��, Corbyn made clear he was referring to state assassinations, rather than police responding to a terror attack to save lives.
Johnson also attacked Corbyn�셲 stance on the nuclear deterrent, though the Labour leader has committed the party to keeping Trident, despite being a committed unilateralist throughout his time as an MP.
�쏛 guy who pre-emptively informs any power that would threaten to engage in nuclear blackmail that as our prime minister he, Corbyn, would not under any circumstances deploy Trident, so making a making a nonsense of our nuclear deterrent,�� Johnson said.
�쏦e is all over the place on our nuclear deterrent. We are spending 짙31bn on Trident. What�셲 the point of this thing if he wants to send it to sea with no nukes aboard, so the whole country is literally firing blanks? It would be a disaster.��
Corbyn�셲 previous scepticism about Nato was also attacked by Johnson, who has been a notable absence in much of the Conservative campaign, which has centred on the prime minister. �쏧 don�셳 think people in this room or around Britain realise quite how much other countries look to us and depend on us,�� Johnson said.
�쏻e are one of the great nuclear powers of the world. We are the second biggest Nato contributor. We have a huge military presence around the world ... They would be appalled if Britain was suddenly abstracted, taken away, from the defence of Europe and of the world. And that would be the real tragedy, in my view, of a Jeremy Corbyn premiership.��
With polls suggesting that Labour�셲 vote is surging because of an enthused youth vote, Johnson said some people were voting for Corbyn because they were too young to remember communism or the IRA.
�쏷he trouble is young people these days �� I�셫 52 �� do not remember nationalisation,�� he said. �쏷hey don�셳 remember Soviet communism. They don�셳 even remember socialism. We don�셳 want it back in this country. It would be an absolute disaster.��
Labour activists protested as Johnson arrived at Shildon Civic Hall, County Durham, and shouts of �쏷ories out�� could be heard from within the hall as Johnson gave his speech to rows of Conservative activists.Labour�셲 Helen Goodman is defending a majority of around 3,000 in Bishop Auckland, which includes Shildon, and colleague Jenny Chapman has a similar slim majority in neighbouring Darlington. Though the area has traditionally been a Labour heartland, the Tories are hoping to win several neighbouring seats.
�쏷his is one of the most deprived wards in the United Kingdom,�� one activist shouted. �쏷hat�셲 thanks to Tory austerity. There are two food banks in this town.��
However, the area voted heavily for Brexit, which was the other main focus of Johnson�셲 speech. The foreign secretary said Labour �쐗ould arrive in Brussels like a family of herbivores at a watering hole of lions... They would be eaten for breakfast.��
Schools across the country are cancelling trips to visit museums, theatres and other central London attractions as a result of the recent terrorist attacks in the capital and Manchester.
Both primary and secondary school pupils have been affected by the clampdown, with trips to attractions including the Science Museum, Tower of London, British Museum and National Gallery among those cancelled.
Headteachers have sent out letters to parents explaining, in some cases, that all trips to London are being suspended until further notice, citing disruption to public transport and the increased armed police presence in the capital as reasons for concern.
Schools in the UK are also briefing pupils and parents about their emergency procedures to keep students safe, including evacuations, terror drills and lockdowns.
Though many parents who responded to a Guardian call-out were relieved their children�셲 trips had been cancelled, others accused schools of overreacting and objected to their children losing out on valuable educational experiences.
Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called on parents to respect their school�셲 decision. �쏰ur advice to schools concerned about planned trips to London is to review and amend risk assessments as necessary, and to talk to parents to gauge their views.
�쏻here school trips go ahead, parents who are concerned can withdraw their children. If schools choose to cancel trips, we would ask that people respect that decision, which will have been made after full discussion and in light of the individual circumstances.��
While visits to London are worst affected after the attacks in London Bridge and Westminster, school trips into Manchester have also been called off following the bomb attack on the Manchester Arena last month, and one school has even cancelled its annual visit to a theme park.
School trips to London from overseas are also likely to be affected. One mother in France said her son�셲 trip from his school in Versailles to the Science Museum, planned for Thursday, may be cancelled. Her other son�셲 trip to the Louvre in Paris tomorrow has already been called off.
�쏧 can understand the concern on the part of the schools,�� she said. �쏧 personally want to carry on as usual, but it�셲 a whole different matter when you�셱e talking about your kids.��
Among UK schools cancelling trips was the Young Dancers academy, an independent day school in Shepherds�셲 Bush, west London, which has called off a visit to the Science Museum planned for election day. Parents have also been informed that pupils are to be banned from going to the nearby Westfield shopping centre at any time for the rest of the term.
An email from the executive director, Kerry Williams, written the day after the London Bridge attack, said: �쏷he school has an emergency procedure in place but we will be seeking advice from [the police] as to whether any further procedures should be implemented.
�쏛fter the horrific events of last night, we are sure you will agree that putting extra safety precautions in place is the sensible step to take.��
One parent, who asked to remain anonymous, said the school had talked to pupils on Monday. �쏬ots of the children were concerned, so they tried to put them at ease, saying the likelihood of being involved in an attack was small. They said we must continue with our lives and carry on, but at the same time they are taking steps like this.��
Nower Hill high school in Pinner, London, has cancelled a number of year 7 and year 8 trips to the University of Westminster, British Museum, National Gallery and Neasden temple among others. A French exchange trip to the Science Museum has also been called off.
In a letter to parents, assistant headteacher Cathie Serrao said: �쏡ue to the inevitable transport disruptions and increased armed police presence that could cause anxiety amongst the children, and after careful consideration of all the risk involved, we have decided to cancel the trips listed below.
�쏻hilst we work very hard at building resilience in our students, we feel that due to the ongoing investigation and election this week, the risk is too high to allow these trips to continue.��
The British Museum and Science Museum confirmed that a number of schools had cancelled in the wake of the terror attacks. Even schools located in the centre of London are calling off visits �� a Kensington school cancelled a trip to the nearby Natural History Museum because of security concerns.
One mother said: �쏻hile part of me feels it�셲 rather ironic the trip has been cancelled, given the school is located just minutes from the museum, another part of me is happy the children will be kept within the confines of the school building.��
Many parents were supportive of school decisions to cancel trips. One parent at an east London school where all trips into the capital have been cancelled said: �쏰verall, I think schools should not plan trips to London any more as long as there is a terrorist threat, especially when taking the kids on the tube as our school does.��
A mother in Lancashire, whose school cancelled a trip to visit the Houses of Parliament, said: �쏧 understand and completely support the decision to cancel the trip.�� A father in south London said he was relieved his daughter�셲 school had cancelled a trip to the National Portrait Gallery after the Manchester bombing.
Other parents expressed concern that planned trips were going ahead. Jennifer Bier, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, said: �쏰urs hasn�셳 been cancelled, but I think many people would rather it was. I don�셳 know how I feel. My son doesn�셳 need to go to the Science Museum in this current climate, but why should he miss out?��
Heather Whicker, of Walthamstow, east London, said her children had lost out twice as a result of the terror attacks. �쏮y twins (year 3) were due to visit the Tower of London a few days after the Westminster attack. It was cancelled. The trip was rearranged for 26 May, but was then cancelled again due to the Manchester attack and raising of [the terrorism threat level] to critical.
�쏧 was disappointed. A risk-averse approach limits enrichment and implies that the terrorists have won. I feel this even though I was only 60 metres away from the Westminster attack and heard it. My children were also very disappointed.��
One father in Warwickshire, furious that his daughter�셲 day trip to London had been cancelled following the latest terror attack, said: �쏧 am totally against the cancellation of the trip. There is probably more risk at a pony-riding party she has been invited to, compared to a trip to London.��
Under the unfriendly glare of strip-lights in an anonymous seminar room on the outskirts of Bristol, a group of about 50 people concerned with the development of public spaces are thinking hard about how to prevent a terrorist attack.
"More people are killed by flying debris than by the bomb blast itself," observes Richard, who is leading the session, and works for the National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO), part of the Home Office. "To mitigate the effects of a bomb blast, among other things, we need to think about controlling access, reducing focal points, or creating smaller focal points, and types of building materials."
As town planners of the future, he makes it plain that these MA students, who are studying for the town and country planning MA at the University of the West of England (UWE), will bear heavy responsibility for the effects of future terrorist attacks in crowded places. As last week's attacks in Mumbai brought home, town centres, transport hubs, hotels and other public spaces are vulnerable to attack. But Richard emphasises that much can be done before a single sod is dug in any new development to make a site less of a target and to reduce the human carnage should the worst happen.
This session is taking place as part of NaCTSO's Project Argus, which has so far developed training workshops in counter-terrorism measures for businesses that feel they could be vulnerable. It is the first time this version, tailored specifically to town planning, design and architecture students, has been aired in public: as well as hoping to raise awareness of the issues, NaCTSO is looking for feedback from UWE's students and tutors.
Various degree courses around the country allow students to look at how armed militancy evolves, examine terrorist psychology and explore ways that individuals who become heavily involved can move from violence to democratic and peaceful political activism.
At Liverpool Hope, for instance, Neil Ferguson, associate professor of psychology, teaches students as part of the university's criminology undergraduate degree about the underlying causes of militant violence, how perpetrators' motivation develops, and how they find themselves transformed by their actions. There is an MA in terrorism, international crime and global security at Coventry University, and a distance learning course in terrorism studies at St Andrews.
But despite the UK's past as a target for IRA attacks, there has to date been little training in this area for planning professionals whose decisions could reduce the practical risk of an attack and mitigate its effects, says Sandra Manley, principal lecturer in UWE's department of planning and architecture.
This is despite a growing demand for expertise in this area, says Aidan Potter, director of urban design and masterplanning at John McAslan and Partners, which is currently working on sensitive embassy projects in Delhi and Algiers, and is also the lead architect for the prestigious development of King's Cross in central London.
"Counter terrorism is increasingly fundamental in the design of government and commercial buildings, and we think about these issues from the very beginning of any such project," he says, going on to explain that particularly in the case of government buildings, there is always a tension - and a balance to be struck - between the accessibility required in a democracy, and the type of security measures that can be designed in to prevent potential terrorists gaining entry.
Government guidance to local authority planners on the avoidance of crime is soon to be updated, with advice on counter terrorism, hence Manley's willingness to host the NaCTSO workshop, albeit with her academic antennae finely tuned for potential propaganda: her introduction includes a warning to students to critically assess the information they are given rather than swallowing it whole.
Which is probably a good thing, because NaCTSO's opening gambit is a 10-minute film of, at times, apocalyptic pronouncements about how our town centres will be emptied of people acting on communal panic as we face increased threats of terrorist attack. This is intercut with shots of a sinister narrator wandering through a deserted shopping mall where half-drunk lattes have been abandoned on cafe tables and a doll sits askew in a child's empty pushchair. Later in the sequence an "academic" is interviewed for a mocked-up TV news bulletin, blaming town planners for not doing more to guard against terrorist attacks.
It feels as though the whole room takes a deep breath as the film ends, but it is only the precursor to a practical exercise during which Richard takes the group through a computer animation of a multiple co-ordinated attack on a fictional city-centre shopping square. The students are then asked to identify the features that increased the impact of the attack, made the space more vulnerable, and any measures that would have reduced the initial risk and lessened the scale of the tragedy.
Richard Morison, 23, says the workshop has given him pause for thought. "The numerous ways in which planners can mitigate for terrorist activities are interesting. There seems to be a worryingly large potential that planning in the past has been responsible for increasing casualties from terrorist activity," he says.
"Counter-terrorism was not something I had previously considered," observes fellow student, Graham Price, 23. "It was surprising how great an effect the design of an area can have on its ability to cope with a terrorist attack."
"Initially, I considered it to be scaremongering," says Jane Wormald, 31, "but after reflecting on the day's events, it seems realistic after all, sadly."
Their course leader is more measured in her assessment of the dire messages given out. "I think the session was rather front-loaded with the terror aspect of terrorism. Look at the blitz - London was functioning and as close to normal as possible in the face of a much greater threat," says Manley.
"The aftermath of recent terrorist attacks also demonstrates that the empty streets - more like a post-nuclear war situation - depicted on the film are not a correct interpretation. I happened to go to London just after the London bombings and the streets looked pretty much as usual."
More studies of how counter-terrorism measures have been successfully integrated into a public space without damaging other design objectives, and less of the Apocalypse Now mentality, is her message to NaCTSO. But it is not a session she thinks the students will forget, and next time they walk into a business district, shopping centre or sports stadium, it may be that these town planners of the future will be paying closer attention to the softness of the target they're standing in.
Over the last year, a mass of shocking evidence has emerged on the close ties between Western government spy agencies and giant energy companies, and their mutual interests in criminalising anti-fracking activists.
In late 2013, official documents obtained under freedom of information showed that Canada's domestic spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), had ramped up its surveillance of activists opposed to the Northern Gateway pipeline project on 'national security' grounds. The CSIS also routinely passed information about such groups to the project's corporate architect, Calgary-based energy company, Enbridge.
The Northern Gateway is an $8 billion project to transport oil from the Alberta tar sands to the British Columbia coast, where it can be shipped to global markets. According to the documents a Canadian federal agency, the National Energy Board, worked with CSIS and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to coordinate with Enbridge, TransCanada, and other energy corporations in gathering intelligence on anti-fracking activists - despite senior police privately admitting they "could not detect a direct or specific criminal threat."
Now it has emerged that former cabinet minister Chuck Strahl - the man appointed by Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper to head up the CSIS' civilian oversight panel, the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) - has been lobbying for Enbridge since 2011.
But that's not all. According to CBC News, only one member of Strahl's spy watchdog committee "has no ties to either the current government or the oil industry." For instance, SIRC member Denis Losier sits on the board of directors of Enbridge-subsidiary, Enbridge NB, while Yves Fortier, is a former board member of TransCanada, the company behind the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.
Investigative journalist Steve Horn reports that TransCanada has also worked closely with American law-enforcement and intelligence agencies in attempting to criminalise US citizens opposed to the pipeline. Files obtained under freedom of information last summer showed that in training documents for the FBI and US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), TransCanada suggested that non-violent Keystone XL protestors could be deterred using criminal and anti-terror statutes:
According to the Earth Island Journal, official documents show that TransCanada "has established close ties with state and federal law enforcement agencies along the proposed pipeline route." But TransCanada is only one example of "the revolving door between state law enforcement agencies and the private sector, especially in areas where fracking and pipeline construction have become big business."
This has had a tangible impact. In March last year, US law enforcement officials had infiltrated and spied on environmentalists attending a tar sands resistance camp in Oklahoma, leading to the successful pre-emptive disruption of their protest action.
Just last December, other activists in Oklahoma faced terror charges for draping an anti-fracking banner in the lobby of the offices housing US oil and gas company, Devon Energy. The two protestors were charged with carrying out a "terrorism hoax" for using gold glitter on their banner, some of which happened to scatter to the floor of the building - depicted by a police spokesman as a potentially "dangerous or toxic" substance in the form of a "black powder," causing a panic.
The criminalisation of peaceful activism under the rubric of 'anti-terrorism' is an escalating trend linked directly to corporate co-optation of the national security apparatus. In one egregious example, thousands of pages of government records confirm how local US police departments, the FBI and the DHS monitored Occupy activists nationwide as part of public-private intelligence sharing with banks and corporations.
Anti-fracking activists in particular have come under increased FBI surveillance in recent years under an expanded definition of 'eco-terrorism', although the FBI concedes that eco-terrorism is on the decline. This is consistent with US defence planning documents over the last decade which increasingly highlight the danger of domestic "insurgencies" due to the potential collapse of public order under various environmental, energy or economic crises.
In the UK, Scotland Yard's National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (which started life as the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit and later became the National Domestic Extremism Unit), has had a long record of equating the spectre of "domestic extremism" with "single-issue protests, such as animal rights, anti-war, anti-globalisation and anti-GM crops." Apart from animal rights, these movements have been "overwhelmingly peaceful" points out George Monbiot.
This has not prevented the police unit from monitoring almost 9,000 Britons deemed to hold "radical political views," ranging from "anti-capitalists" to "anti-war demonstrators." Increasingly though, according to a Guardian investigation, the unit "is known to have focused its resources on spying on environmental campaigners, particularly those engaged in direct action and civil disobedience to protest against climate change."
Most recently, British police have gone so far as to conduct surveillance of Cambridge University students involved in social campaigns like anti-fracking, education, anti-fascism, and opposition to austerity, despite a lack of reason to suspect criminal activity.
This is no accident. Yesterday, senior Tory and ex-Cabinet minister Lord Deben, chairman of the UK government-sponsored Committee on Climate Change, characterised anyone suggesting that fracking is "devastatingly damaging" as a far-left "extremist," holding "nonsensical" views associated with "Trotskyite" dogma. In contrast, he described "moderate" environmentalists as situated safely in the legitimate spectrum of a "broad range of consensus" across "all political parties."
In other words, if you are disillusioned with the existing party political system and its approach to environmental issues, you are an extremist.
Deben's comments demonstrate the regressive mindset behind the British government's private collaboration with shale gas industry executives to "manage the British public's hostility to fracking," as revealed in official emails analysed by Damien Carrington.
The emails exposed the alarming extent to which government is "acting as an arm of the gas industry," compounding earlier revelations that Department of Energy and Climate Change employees involved in drafting UK energy policy have been seconded from UK gas corporations.
The latest polling data shows that some 47% of Britons "would not be happy for a gas well site using fracking to open within 10 miles of their home," with just 14% saying they would be happy. By implication, the government views nearly half of the British public as potential extremists merely for being sceptical of shale gas.
This illustrates precisely why the trend-line of mass surveillance exemplified in the Snowden disclosures has escalated across the Western world. From North America to Europe, the twin spectres of "terrorism" and "extremism" are being disingenuously deployed by an ever more centralised nexus of corporate, state and intelligence power, to suppress widening public opposition to that very process of unaccountable centralisation.
But then, what's new? Back in 1975, the Trilateral Commission - a network of some 300 American, European and Japanese elites drawn from business, banking, government, academia and media founded by Chase Manhattan Bank chairman David Rockerfeller - published an influential study called The Crisis of Democracy.
The report concluded that the problems of governance "stem from an excess of democracy" which makes government "less powerful and more active" due to being "overloaded with participants and demands." This democratic excess at the time consisted of:
The solution, therefore, is "to restore the prestige and authority of central government institutions," including "hegemonic power" in the world. This requires the government to somehow "reinforce tendencies towards political passivity" and to instill "a greater degree of moderation in democracy." This is because:
Today, such official sentiments live on in the form of covert psychological operations targeted against Western publics by the CIA, Pentagon and MI6, invariably designed to exaggerate threats to manipulate public opinion in favour of government policy.
As the global economy continues to suffocate itself, and as publics increasingly lose faith in prevailing institutions, the spectre of 'terror' is an increasingly convenient tool to attempt to restore authority by whipping populations into panic-induced subordination.
Evidently, however, what the nexus of corporate, state and intelligence power fears the most is simply an "excess of democracy": the unpalatable prospect of citizens rising up and taking power back.

Exactly a week after two terrorists killed Father Jacques Hamel while he said mass in his own church, nearly 2,000 mourners paid their respects to the Catholic priest, described by his sister as �쐌y brother. Everyone�셲 brother.��
The emotionally powerful ceremony at Rouen cathedral, attended by the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, and religious leaders including Muslim representatives, took place amid high security.
Hundreds of people who could not get into the cathedral watched the ceremony from under umbrellas on a big screen.
Dominique Lebrun, the archbishop of Rouen, told mourners that after his throat was slit, Hamel pushed one of his attackers with his feet, saying: �쏥et away, Satan.�� Praising the murdered clergyman for 58 years of loyal service to the church, he said: �쏪acques, you were a loyal disciple of Jesus. Where you went you did good.��
Saluting representatives of the Muslim and Jewish faiths, he called for peace and tolerance adding: �쏯ever again.�� It was not a question of forgiving those who had made a �쐏act with the devil��, but called on those taken by �쐂emonic madness�� to remember their mothers �쐗ho gave you life��.
Roselyne Hamel, the priest�셲 elder sister, told the congregation her brother had served in the Franco-Algerian war but had refused an officer�셲 commission because he would not �쐎rder men to kill other men��.
In a tearful tribute, Hamel�셲 niece, Jessica Delporte, added: �쏛fter Charlie Hebdo I posted this phrase [on social media] �쁎h my God, let�셲 keep our tolerance and discernment��, never thinking I would have to apply that phrase to myself with so much force and conviction.��
Hamel, 85, was among six people taken hostage when two men who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State stormed the church at Saint-횋tienne-du-Rouvray.
The attackers, Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, both 19, forced the priest to kneel before slitting his throat, then stabbed one of his elderly parishioners. Sister Danielle, one of three nuns present, managed to escape and raise the alarm. The attackers were shot dead as they left the church.
Kermiche and Petitjean, who are thought to have met for the first time only days before the attack after making contact on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, had both tried to join Isis in Syria. Kermiche had been released from prison, where he had been awaiting trial for two attempts to join the jihadis, and was wearing an electronic tag at the time of the attack.
Saint-횋tienne-du-Rouvray�셲 Muslims have opposed suggestions that Kermiche could be buried in the town where he killed the local priest.
�쏥iven that he�셲 a terrorist who has done us much wrong, he doesn�셳 deserve any respect,�� Mohammed Karabila, imam of the mosque at Saint-횋tienne-du-Rouvray, told Europe 1 radio. �쏦aving said that, his remains have to be buried somewhere. There will be no official [mosque] representative and no prayer at the mosque.�� The town authorities at Saint-횋tienne-du-Rouvray have not decided whether to allow the terrorist�셲 burial in their district.
Three men are in the custody of anti-terrorist police and are being questioned about their connection to the attack. One of them, a 30-year-old cousin of Petitjean, is accused of �쏿ssociation with criminals in relation to an illegal terrorist organisation��. The public prosecutor�셲 office said the suspect �쐗as perfectly aware that his cousin�셲 violent plan of action was imminent��, adding that examination of the man�셲 phone and computer revealed that he knew �쏿 lot more than he wanted to tell police��.
A 17-year-old who tried to reach Syria with Kermiche in 2015 before he was arrested in Switzerland and a 19-year-old are also under arrest.
On Monday evening, Brittany Ferries carried out an exercise with a view to introducing armed sea marshals on board French cross-Channel vessels. No firm plan has been announced to make trained military personnel part of the crew.
Speaking to a military crowd in Florida, US president Donald Trump has again criticised the media, branding them �쁵ery dishonest�� and saying news outlets are deliberately not reporting on terrorist attacks
After the tragic events in Manchester, it is easy to view young people as helpless victims and forget their transformative potential.
I work for Aik Saath �� Together As One, a charity established almost 20 years ago in the aftermath of violence between gangs of young Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in Slough. Our founders believed that young people needed to be empowered to lead the response and ever since then we have been training young mentors to visit schools and youth centres to lead training sessions on diversity, cohesion, identity and �쏝ritishness��.
We find that a spotlight tends to focus on our work whenever the bonds between people in our society appear most threatened: when the English Defence League comes to town, when a terrorist attack takes place in the UK, when gang violence spirals on to the streets. This week we have been asked how young people feel. Are they scared to go out? Will their behaviour change because of what�셲 happened? Have the young Muslims that support us faced a backlash? These questions understandably focus on young people as the new victims of global terror.The terror attack at the Manchester Arena was a horrific incident and the outcry is rightly urgent, but community relations will improve or worsen much more quietly, in the background.
We have some incredible young volunteers, from all walks of life, working to improve the quality of community relations in Slough and surrounding areas on a daily basis. They give up their spare time to deliver workshops that advance people�셲 understanding of cohesion in modern Britain.
Slough, one of the most diverse places in the UK outside London, is a brilliant town in which to do this work. One of our workshops for primary school children involves constructing a timeline of migration into our town. It starts with Welsh people travelling down the route that eventually became the M4, sometimes on foot, in search of a better life. It includes bombed-out Londoners moving into post-war housing estates. It includes waves of migration from south Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe.
We finish by putting me, a white British man, and one of my non-white colleagues in front of the class and ask them who is more British. Invariably they point to me. I�셫 white and white people have �쐀een here longer��. We refer back to the timeline �� how the UK has recently arrived white communities, and black and Asian communities stretching back hundreds of years. How can they know who�셲 been here for longer? And in any case, what difference does being somewhere for longer make? We help children divorce the idea of skin colour from Britishness, so that young people understand their appearance has nothing to do with their national identity or the country they identify as home.
This work is led by young people. Every day they are there, quietly, effectively forging a bulwark against those trying to brainwash young people into believing that this is not their country and they will never quite fully belong. By taking teenagers into classrooms and youth centres to talk to their peers, we are using relatable role models to break down barriers and prevent them from developing in the future.
The bombing in Manchester was intended to foment hatred and tensions between communities. Thankfully, this has largely led to a sense of defiant unity. In the same way that we have resisted the terrorist�셲 efforts to destroy community relations, we must resist the urge to re-cast young people as merely potential victims. They can and will play a vital role in ensuring our communities are united enough to prevent atrocities like this from happening in the future.Rob Deeks is chief executive of Aik Saath - Together As One

Theresa May is in Sicily today for the G7 summit, with Manchester and the counter-terrorism response casting a long shadow over the gathering. The prime minister will tell assembled world leaders that more needs to be done to tackle online extremism, pointing the finger at companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, which she believes could do more to remove harmful content and report the people behind it.
More finger-pointing comes with accusations that government cuts to police numbers could have undermined intelligence-gathering. On BBC Question Time on Thursday evening, the home secretary Amber Rudd denied the cutbacks �� there were around 20,000 fewer officers in 2016 than in 2009 �� had played a role:
Jeremy Corbyn will also raise the issue of police numbers when he returns to the stump this morning, in a speech in which he will remind voters of Labour�셲 manifesto pledge to put 10,000 extra officers on the streets. But the core of the speech �� and the element that has already won him a rebuke from former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown: �쐍ow is not the time, and this is not the event, to seek political advantage�� �� will be his argument that there are connections to be made between British foreign policy and terror attacks. The government, he will say, must ensure:
But Corbyn will also say:
Meanwhile, Paul Nuttall published the Ukip manifesto yesterday, framing it as taking a tough line against Islamist extremism. But the launch drew more attention for claims by manifesto author Suzanne Evans that May �쐌ust bear some responsibility�� for the Manchester attack (a line she later stepped back from), and for its scientifically wobbly pledge that banning the niqab and burqa in public places would help prevent vitamin D deficiency. And that face-covering ban goes for balaclavas, too.
The lull in polling also ends, with a fresh YouGov survey for The Times showing the Tory lead over Labour squeezed to just five points. The poll, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week, places the Conservatives on 43% (down one point week on week), and Labour on 38% (up three). The #libdemfightback continues to flail: they�셱e up one to 10%.
The question of when to resume campaigning has been a sensitive one, Abi Wilkinson writes in New Internationalist:
It would have been unedifying, to say the least, to watch Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn squabble as the body count was still rising �� but they must now join a conversation that has already started without them. Even if we consider it opportune to hold our tongue for some amount of time, there�셲 no way to pause our brain�셲 ability to form opinions. There�셲 fierce disagreement about both the cause of this sort of violence and the most effective policy responses �� How can we expect these events not to dominate election discourse for the remainder of the campaign period?
Philip Collins in the Times says the events of this week might not have a clinching effect on the election:
A conventional interpretation will settle about this terrible week, in which Mrs May was saved from her botched manifesto by the need to be prime ministerial in response to an atrocity. The temporary suspension of campaigning, it will be said, came at the ideal moment for her and changed the subject from social care to security, on which she is strong and Mr Corbyn is weak.
 It�셲 always a mistake to read the election up so close, though. Almost all elections are won by fundamental questions determined long in advance of the campaign itself. When Jo Cox was murdered during the European referendum campaign there were confident predictions about its impact. In the event, there was no impact. The campaign had been going on for 40 years.
An analysis by the Press Association has found that in the week running up to Monday�셲 voter registration deadline, the Conservative party did not once use its social media platforms to encourage people to sign up. Theresa May�셲 Twitter and Facebook accounts were also silent on the subject. The same analysis found 36% of Labour social media posts that week, and 26% from Jeremy Corbyn�셲 accounts, urged followers to register.
More than 620,000 people applied to register on Monday ahead of the midnight deadline �� 246,000 of them aged under 25.

When I started to earn my living at the Palace of Westminster, a time so long ago that Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp and some of you were not born, I did not even require a photopass to get on to the premises. A piece of card with my name on it and an official signature was enough to be waved in by the police officers at the gates. After I�셝 been working there a short while, it was rarely necessary even to produce the bit of card because the police and doorkeepers had a brilliant capacity to memorise faces. It was easier in those days, because fewer people worked on the parliamentary estate.
There were no officers carrying automatic weapons on the precincts. None that I saw, anyway. The only person visibly armed was the serjeant at arms, with his ceremonial sword. So relaxed was security that protesters for this cause or that frequently got into the public gallery to disrupt proceedings by yelling at MPs and sometimes chucking things down at parliamentarians. On one occasion, startled MPs were bombarded with three bags of horse manure.
I am almost depicting Westminster in the mid-1980s as a prelapsarian age, blissfully free from the threat of terrorism. That was not actually the case. The Provisional IRA was conducting its ferocious campaign of carnage that had endured for such a long time it felt like the opposite of �쐏rovisional��. When I began working at Westminster, the main focus of security was on the inspection of vehicles because the Provos�� weapon of choice was the car bomb. The IRA had unleashed their brand of death at several of London�셲 prestige locations, including Westminster itself. The Tory MP Airey Neave was killed by a device planted in his vehicle that went off in the Commons underground carpark. By fearful symmetry, the site of that murder is only a few yards away from where PC Keith Palmer was fatally stabbed on Wednesday by an assailant from this era�셲 manifestation of terror.
That those two atrocities lie almost 40 years apart could be called remarkable. It also helps to account for the amplitude of the shock, a shock further magnified by Khalid Masood�셲 murderous spree across Westminster Bridge as he mowed down innocents of all ages and from across the world. A man armed with a hire car and kitchen knives is precisely the kind of low-tech, crude and deadly assault that the security services have long dreaded. Paris and Nice, Berlin and Brussels had all given warning of what could happen here.
Yet the anticipating of atrocity does not lessen its impact and nor should it. It does not diminish the human cost inflicted on the victims and their families. I am not sure it is all that much comfort to the injured and the bereaved to hear politicians repeating a continuous loop of platitudinous mantras that terror can never win, even if those declarations are right and well meant. Nor will we quickly forget the grim spectacle of the seat of our democracy being sealed off and locked down. We should be glad that we do feel shock. There is an important difference between commendable, tea-drinking stoicism in the face of terror and being so numbly resigned to it that we become desensitised to its consequences.
I was among the hundreds of people cocooned inside the parliamentary estate for many hours. One of the things to be said for the experience is that you get to talk to a lot of people who serve parliament and, by extension, our democracy in so many different ways, from the folk who cook the meals to those who deliver the mail. It was a reminder that Westminster is not just a place of employment, the cockpit of our democracy and a national institution. For those who work there, Westminster is also a family. During the lockdown, a Labour man said to me: �쏧 confess I am rather relieved that Theresa May is prime minister.�� He meant that she would have the experience, from her time as home secretary, to cope calmly and respond appropriately to the attack and that the prime minister would be adept at projecting a demeanour designed to reassure the public.
That she did. Mrs May spoke well when she made her statement outside Number 10 in the immediate aftermath of the murders and again when she addressed a hushed Commons the next day. Politicians of all parties, bar a few vile opportunists intent on stoking division, have echoed the prime minister in expressing a determination to resist both terror and Islamophobia. Mrs May had a poetic line about the best response to terrorism being �쐌illions of acts of normality��.
That sentiment is nice, but the suggestion that nothing at all will be changed by this event is a polite fiction that everyone indulges in a prime minister at a time like this. Acts of terror do alter the way we live and how politicians behave. This will shape the national conversation and influence crucial decisions and it is best that we acknowledge this rather than pretend the opposite.
There will be visible changes almost immediately and other consequences that will take longer to manifest. The attack will alter the balance of debate within government when security issues are in contention with concerns about civil liberties. When the police and the intelligence services ask for more money or more powers, ministers will probably be that bit more inclined to give them what they want. There will be a sharper focus on the effectiveness of anti-extremism programmes. Some of these changes to the national conversation will be welcome and overdue. It is excellent to see escalating pressure on the digital mega-corporations finally to take responsibility for dealing with the toxic sewage spewing from their platforms.
The most important test by which to judge Mrs May is not her rhetorical response in the immediate aftermath of these attacks. The key test is whether she and her government find policy answers that are effective and proportionate.
Parliament itself will be changed. The threat of terror has palpably altered Westminster in the years that I have worked there. There is a giant, airtight glass screen between the public gallery and the chamber. Whitehall is laced with concrete and steel barriers and bollards, a legacy of 9/11. Once upon a time, Downing Street was much like any other street. People could simply wander down it as they liked. The black gates at the entrance, originally introduced as a temporary measure during the IRA�셲 murderous campaign, have become a permanent sight. What we regard as �쐍ormal�� has changed a great deal over the years.
There is already a lively argument about how to enhance the protection of Westminster. I have long thought �� and I know many MPs who agree �� that the perimeter defences have some vulnerable spots. I have never written about them �� and I am not going to start now �� for very obvious reasons. I have also thought the parliamentary authorities deserved some understanding as they have tried to wrestle with two competing pressures.
The terror threat has been accompanied by rising public disenchantment with parliament as an institution, a hostility given rocket fuel by the relentless accusation that everyone who works there is an inhabitant of a �쏻estminster bubble�� that is cut off from the real world. One good outcome of these events would be the cessation of that lazy and poisonous cliche that dehumanises the people without whom our democracy would not function. Parliament has put a lot of effort into trying to make itself more accessible to the public and a friendlier place to visit. More than a million visitors come through its gates every year. During the long hours when the parliamentary estate was locked down, a party of schoolchildren lifted hearts by singing songs. I took under my wing a couple of journalism students who were on a visit from Sheffield University, facilitated by their MP and who had become separated from their group in the chaos.
Questions are being asked about why Keith Palmer and his fellow officers at the Carriage Gates into New Palace Yard were unarmed. If this was a mistake, it was a failing with an explanation that is rather admirable. The officers at the front gate are among parliament�셲 most public-facing people. They are not just guardians of Westminster, they are also ambassadors for it. They keep pedestrians safe from the vehicles swinging into the front courtyard from Parliament Square. They help out the lost. They are often to be seen having their photos taken with tourists.
I suppose that will have to change. While a part of me will understand why there will be a heavier armed presence at the gates, another part will mourn that little win for terror. I guess there will be some voices saying that parliament should be entirely relocated to a site that is easier to defend. Of course, you could make it tremendously secure by moving parliament away from the heart of a teeming city and placing it on an inaccessible island. I find that thought hateful, the idea of turning the seat of our democracy into a remote fortress. I find it wonderful that almost everyone else who works at Westminster shares my resistance to handing terror that sort of victory.
A married teenage couple are ready to face a committal on terror-related charges, prosecutors have told a Sydney court.
Sameh Bayda and his wife Alo-Bridget Namoa, both 19, had their existing charges upgraded on Wednesday to also include �쐁onspiracy to do an act, or acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act or acts��.
The pair, who have been in custody since their arrests in the early part of 2016, did not appear via video link when the case was mentioned in Sydney�셲 central local court.
Alison Edwards, for the prosecution, said the bulk of the evidence had been served. �쏷he prosecution is ready to proceed to committal,�� she told the court.
But Geoffrey Foster, appearing for the pair, requested the case be listed only for mention on 15 March.
The presiding magistrate, Alexander Mijovich, was eager to see the matter move on, given there was no new material in the brief of evidence.
�쏧t needs to proceed, it can�셳 just keep on meandering along now that they�셶e sorted out the charges and the brief,�� he said.
When the pair were initially arrested, Bayda was charged with collecting documents likely to facilitate an attack, and Namoa with recklessly possessing documents and other things connected to an attack.
Police said the new charges came about after an extensive New South Wales counter-terrorism investigation.
Court documents have previously revealed Bayda allegedly possessed documents from al-Qaida, as well as instructions for a homemade bomb and a guide for a stabbing attack.
Namoa is accused of possessing a hunting knife and documents detailing how to make an improvised explosive device.
Namoa, who allegedly referred to the couple as an �쏧slamic Bonnie and Clyde��, had also been charged after refusing to answer questions at a NSW crime commission hearing.
Her solicitor has previously argued she was merely a �쐔errified young woman�� whose refusal to answer questions was driven by fear.
In September, a court heard Namoa had an �쐇nfatuation with violence�� and said she could watch beheadings �쏿ll day��.
Egypt launched a fresh wave of air strikes against Libyan terrorist bases on Saturday in response to the killing of 29 Coptic Christians south of Cairo, with a warning of further retaliation possible.
The airstrikes follow six bombing raids in Libya that hit the north-eastern coastal town of Derna on Friday, with Cairo officials saying bombs struck terrorist training camps of the Shura Council, aligned with al-Qaida.
Pictures from Derna on social media showed devastated buildings but there were no reliable casualty numbers.
The savagery of the attack on the Copts, with at least two children, aged two and four, among the dead, has shocked Egypt. The Copts had been travelling to the monastery of St Samuel the Confessor, 85 miles south of Cairo, when their small convoy was halted on a desert road by up to 10 gunmen dressed as soldiers, who then opened fire.
Although Egyptian forces targeted an al-Qaida affiliated group, the responsibility for the attack was claimed by Islamic State, which has carried out previous atrocities against Egypt�셲 Copts. Libyan sources say Egypt has indicated more attacks, possibly including groundstrikes, are being considered by Cairo.
Within hours of Friday�셲 killings, the president of Egypt, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, declared: �쏣gypt will not hesitate to strike terrorist camps anywhere.�� The president told Pope Towadros II, leader of the Coptic church in Egypt, that the state would not rest easy until the perpetrators of the attack were punished.
In Genoa, Pope Francis prayed for the Copts, saying that today there were more Christian martyrs for the faith than in ancient times. He prayed �쐄or our brothers, Egyptian Christian Copts who were killed because they did not want to renounce their faith��.
Egypt has been in a state of emergency since two suicide bombings killed 45 people at Coptic churches last month, following December�셲 slaughter of 29 Copts in a Cairo cathedral.
The bombing highlights Libya�셲 position as a haven for jihadist groups, with the civil war leaving much of the country in chaos and jihadi groups proliferating.
Neighbouring countries are also coming under attack from Libya-based jihadists. Tunisia is fighting a cat-and-mouse battle with Isis terrorists crossing back and forth from Libya. Seifeddine Rezgui, who killed 38 tourists, 30 of them British, on a beach in Sousse two years ago, was trained by Isis in the western Libyan town of Sabratha.
Isis itself is on the back foot in Libya, its main base at Sirte having been overrun in December after a bloody six-month campaign by Misrata militias backed by US airstrikes. But its response has been to withdraw further into Libya�셲 vast Sahara. On Friday, four Libyan soldiers were killed battling Isis near the desert town of Bani Walid.
Diplomats say airstrikes alone will not purge Libya of terrorists, and are pinning their hopes on the end of a civil war between Libya�셲 two rival governments to bring peace and allow terror groups to be cleaned out. That is a distant prospect, with Tripoli�셲 all-powerful militias fighting one of their periodic turf wars this weekend. The battle was witnessed on Friday by British ambassador Peter Millett who tweeted: �쏞an hear explosions & artillery fire in south Tripoli.��
The Foreign Office will not be offering consular visits to Manchester bomber Salman Abedi�셲 father, Ramadan, and younger brother, Hashim, who were arrested by a pro-government militia last week. Salman Abedi is believed to have spent three weeks in Libya shortly before the attack.
A British Islamic extremist is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of planning a terrorist attack on American military personnel in Britain.
Delivery driver Junead Khan, 25, used his job with a pharmaceutical firm as cover to scout United States Air Force (Usaf) bases in East Anglia, his trial heard.
Detectives later found he had been exchanging chilling online messages with an Islamic State fighter in Syria calling himself Abu Hussain, describing attacking military personnel after faking a road accident.
Prosecutors claimed Hussain was in fact British-born Junaid Hussain, who was killed in a US drone strike in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa weeks after his link with the planned UK attack was discovered.
After Khan was arrested in July, police found pictures on his phone of him posing in his bedroom with an Isis-style black flag, which they later found in the attic. His computer was also found to contain an al-Qaida bomb manual and Amazon searches for a large combat knife.
Khan was found guilty of preparing for an act of terrorism in the UK between May and July 2015 after a trial at Kingston crown court in London. He was also convicted alongside his uncle Shazib Khan, 23, of preparing to go to Syria to join Isis. Some of the evidence used to convict the pair cannot be revealed for legal reasons.
Both men had denied engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts between 1 August 2014 and 15 July 2015.
Neither showed any emotion as the jury returned its verdicts after deliberating for almost 24 hours at the end of a six and a half week trial. Judge Mr Justice Edis remanded the men in custody ahead of sentencing on May 13.
The jury unanimously found Junead Khan guilty of planning a UK terror attack but by a 10-2 majority on the second charge of planning to travel to Syria. Shazib Khan was found guilty by unanimous verdict.
Junead Khan�셲 work as an agency driver for pharmaceutical firm Alliance Healthcare legitimately took him to East Anglia in May and June 2015, the court heard. During these trips he drove close to bases operated by Usaf �� RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, as well as RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire.
The trial heard that in one of their 5 July conversations on the encrypted SureSpot app, Junead Khan talked to Hussain about faking a road accident before getting out to attack people directly, and carrying a bomb.
Hussain said: �쏧 can get you addresses but of British soldiers�� to which Khan replied �쐔hat could also be possible��.
Hussain added: �쏮ost soldiers live in bases which are protected. I suppose on the road is the best idea. Or if you want akhi I can tell u how to make a bomb.��
Khan then told Hussain: �쏻hen I saw these us (sic) soldiers on road it looked simple but I had nothing on me or wouldve (sic) got into an accident with them and made them get out the car.��
Hussain replied: �쏷hat�셲 what the brother done with Lee Rigby.��
He went on to say he would send Junead Khan a manual for making a �쐏ressure cooker bomb��, adding: �쏧t�셲 best to have at least pipe bombs or pressure cooker bomb in a backpack in case something happens �� so you can do isthishadi (suicide) bomb in case they try arrest you.��
Junaid Hussain was married to Sally-Anne Jones, a former member of an all-girl punk rock group from Kent. He was one of the Britons Isis supported whose personal details were in documents released this month after reportedly being stolen by disillusioned Isis fighter.
Jurors were not told this, or of his senior position in Isis, only that he was in Syria and had later been killed in an American drone strike.
The prosecution had alleged that Junead Khan planned to travel to Syria with his relative but altered his plan to focus on an attack in the UK, either on British or US service personnel.
Giving evidence in court he said while he supported the establishment of an Islamic state, he did not wish to become a fighter himself.
Shazib Khan admitted exchanging messages with friends saying they had a �쐒ole to play�� and that he wanted to help �쐀y any means��, but insisted he meant through providing money and food, not violence.
What tribute to the people killed in Manchester would be fitting? How could we, as individuals, be part of such a tribute? Maybe a start could be made by stating as simply as possible the cause of that attack. The cause is political conflict, at its most global and ideologically crazed. At its least amenable to reason. At its ugliest and most crude. At its wildest and most ruthless. At its most pitiless and self-righteous.
Britain is, of course, in the midst of a vastly more ritualised political conflict. The general election campaign was paused after Monday�셲 atrocity. No one will ever know quite how much its course has been changed by Salman Abedi�셲 nihilistic crime.
One thing won�셳 change, not in the short term. A general election is the enactment of the most direct expression of our democracy. It is democracy that makes it so worthwhile for millions of people to learn and think about all manner of complex matters, and how our society can attend to them. If Britain allows Abedi�셲 bomb to distort all that, we will be furthering his agenda.
Our democracy is far from perfect, offering only two plausible choices: as basic and simple as conflict can get. As well as the smallest range in which choice can be said to exist. Few people, thinking about how to vote, will believe that all the answers lie in the making of one choice and none in the making of another. Yet our leaders and media persist in pretending that somehow the choice between Labour and Tory is like the choice between night and day.
In truth, a triumph for either party will not change the nature of the challenges that face us, or the difficulty of solving them. And neither is even offering complete honesty about that. Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, offers stark warnings about both of them.
�쏤or Labour, we can have pretty much everything �� free higher education, free childcare, more spending on pay, health, infrastructure. And the pretence is that it can all be funded by faceless corporations and �쁳he rich��.�� Conservative plans �쐇mply at least another five years of austerity, with the continuation of planned welfare cuts and serious pressures on the public services including on the NHS��.
The crude caricatures, of Labour standing for tax and spend with consequent pressure on private enterprise, and the Tories standing for shrinking the state and utter misery for the most vulnerable, remain dispiritingly accurate. Both parties imply that they will do the things they have done before, but somehow, this time, with different results. Each party, however, tends to get a turn only when the other�셲 shortcomings have been fully exposed. This is our own political conflict, from which we seem unable to free ourselves.
Is it possible to find a way to lessen that conflict? Private enterprise certainly benefits from infrastructural investment, for example: but is it truly outrageous to imagine a corporate mindshift in which private enterprise stops believing that taxes are being squandered on ne�셞r-do-wells, but are demonstrably being invested in necessities of construction and engineering that benefit all of society? We need to remember Monday�셲 victims. I want a bridge named after 15-year-old Megan Hurley. I want a block of social housing that carries the name of Sorrell Leczkowski. I want this not only in Manchester, but all over this country, for all those who died as a consequence of political failures.
Wouldn�셳 any wealthy company be proud to know that its profits helped to finance such an endeavour? The idea that the rich are taxed to subsidise the poor, rather than to enrich the country as a whole, has been the central conflict of our political culture in my life, and it is time for all sides to make an effort to change the terms of the debate. Our political system is so mired in conflict that the pointing out of obvious things has become a mark of naivety.
I don�셳 want the legacy of these dead children to be further squabbling over the �쐗ar on terror��. Everyone understands that the past has brought us to the present. Everyone knows that the past is littered with mistakes and cruelties and horrors. Everyone knows that only the future can embody the change that we want to see. There are manifest goods, so many, in British society: for example, the capacity to house all our citizens in safety and comfort. Why we allow this wonderful truth to be traduced by an argument over whether public or private money should fund the endeavour is a hard thing to explain to any child.
I do want the legacy of these dead children to be a recognition that conflict is problematic and should be minimised wherever it is found. It is time for the people of Britain to let our politicians know what is expected of any politician from any party: ideas and approaches that seek to unite us, not ideas and approaches that seek always, always, to divide us. That�셲 the only direction that will bring progress �� and, dare I say it, even some harmony.
The first visible signs of the deployment of 984 soldiers on the streets of Britain will be on Wednesday afternoon outside Downing Street, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace as they �쐀ackfill�� guarding duties at key sites currently carried out by armed police officers.
Both the prime minister and home secretary made clear in their announcement of the move that they are extremely wary of the political impact of the sight of armed soldiers patrolling the streets of Britain and want to use them for as short a time as possible.
The threat level has only twice before been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced on 1 August 2006. It was raised for three days from 10 August 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot, and on 30 June 2007 when the security services uncovered the plot to bomb a nightclub on London�셲 Haymarket.
This was a plot that culminated in the attack on Glasgow airport. The threat level was reduced to severe three days later on 13 August 2007 after suspects were arrested as far afield as Australia. However, already there are warnings to the police that this time the critical threat may last up to a week.
The use of troops �쐇n aid to the civil power�� on the streets of Britain is a major move by the security chiefs and directly flows from the decision to raise the threat level from severe �� meaning an attack is likely �� to critical, meaning an attack is expected imminently.
As Theresa May explained when she made the decision public: �쏷his means that armed police officers responsible for duties such as guarding key sites will be replaced by members of the armed forces, which will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations.
�쏽ou might also see military personnel deployed at certain events, such as concerts and sports matches, helping the police to keep the public safe. In all circumstances, members of the armed forces who are deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers.�� Sports events are expected to include this weekend�셲 FA Cup final.
The announcement of the move to a critical threat level on Tuesday night was unusual. In recent years changes in the threat level have been announced by the home secretary alone on a recommendation from the �쐇ndependent�� Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC).
The decision was also unusual in that MI5�셲 definition of a critical threat is that an attack is expected imminently.
May did not say this in her late-night statement. Instead she said only that it was �쏿 possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack�� and that �쏿 further attack may be imminent��. This is different and does not mean that they know an active cell, including a potential bomber, is at large but that they fear it may be the case and need to be cautious.
For both May and Amber Rudd one major reason for their anxiety will be that the sight of armed troops on the streets will provoke accusations of moves towards a French-style �쐌ilitarised police state�� and inevitable speculation that in the middle of a general election campaign the decision comes with political overtones as well as from operational necessity.
The last time the use of troops under Operation Temperer was considered was immediately after the terrorist attacks in Paris. But in the face of defence reservations they were only used covertly as backup for the visible armed police presence at railway stations and airports, and so this is the first time the plan has been fully activated.
Both May and Rudd will be also be mindful of the reaction to a 2003 decision by Tony Blair to deploy 400 soldiers and three Scimitar armoured cars at Heathrow airport in response to an alleged plot for a missile attack on aircraft. Blair was sharply criticised for his �쐓end in the tanks��-style response to a terrorist threat.
Defence chiefs are also anxious about the use of their troops on the streets. They look at France where an initial deployment in the immediate aftermath of the Brussels and Paris attacks has proved far from temporary. Indeed, their numbers have since been increased and armed soldiers patrolling the streets are now a common sight even in towns in rural France. The military has also voiced concerns about overstretch and the morale of the troops being used.
Operation Temperer means that up to 3,800 armed troops can be deployed at sensitive sites and events, transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release the armed police for other policing duties. They can only be used �쐔o augment armed police officers engaged in protective security duties�� and can only be authorised by a Cobra emergency meeting.
The prime minister went out of her way to stress that the armed troops would be under the direct command of the police who would also determine where and how they are used. The home secretary also stressed it was a temporary measure.
The decision to increase the threat level was taken by JTAC, which analyses and assesses all intelligence relating to international terrorism in Britain and overseas. It brings together counter-terrorism experts from the police, security services and Whitehall departments. They include Charles Farr, chairman of the joint intelligence committee, and Mark Sedwill, national security adviser, who both worked very closely with May at the Home Office.
As May indicated, it met repeatedly on Tuesday to assess the level of threat. In the morning it decided that the threat level should remain at severe but as the police investigation continued into the associates of the Manchester suicide bomber �� Salman Abedi �� they took the decision to raise it to the highest level.
As the prime minister explained, the �쐏ossibility of a wider network�� being behind Abedi�셲 attack justified their decision. The clear implication is that he came from a terrorist jihadi cell some elements of which may well still be active and a real danger.
The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) is so hardline that it was disavowed by al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Led by an Iraqi called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Isis was originally an al-Qaida group in Iraq, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). As the Syrian civil war intensified, its involvement in the conflict was indirect at first. Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, an ISI member, established Jabhat al-Jabhat al-Nusra in mid-2011, which became the main jihadi group in the Syrian war. Joulani received support and funding from ISI and Baghdadi.
But Baghdadi sought to gain influence over the increasingly powerful Jabhat al-Nusra by directly expanding ISI's operations into Syria, forming Isis in April last year. Differences over ideology and strategy soon led to bitter infighting. Isis turned to out to be too extreme and brutal not just for Jabhat al-Nusra, but for al-Qaida itself, leading to a public repudiation by Zawahiri, who last month called on Isis to leave Syria and return to Iraq.
By then Isis had lost ground in Syria to Jabhat al-Nusra and its allies. But any notion that Isis is a spent force has been shattered by its capture of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. Isis now controls territory that stretches from the eastern edge of Aleppo, Syria, to Falluja in western Iraq and now the northern city of Mosul.
Isis has shown its ruthlessness and brutality in the areas of Syria under its control, eastern Aleppo and the city of Raqqa. It was blamed for the February killing of a founding member of the Salafi group Ahrar al-Sham and the group's leader in Aleppo, Muhammad Bahaiah, who had close connections with senior al-Qaida leaders. It was also blamed for the assassination of Jabhat al-Nusra's leader in the Idlib governorate, Abu Muahmmad al-Ansari, along with his wife, children and relatives. It ordered the crucifixion of a man accused of murder; other forms of punishment include beheadings and amputations.
Despite its brutal reputation, Isis has shown flexibility as well in Iraq to win over disaffected Sunnis in the north against the Shia-led government of Nouri al-Maliki. Mushreq Abbas, who writes on Iraq for the Al-Monitor website, describes how Baghdadi has presented himself as an alternative to the Sunni political class tribal leaders and moderate clerics who oppose central government.
"Until now, Baghdadi's fighters have not harmed religious men �� when the tribes refused to raise Isis banners in Falluja, he ordered his fighters not to raise the banner and try to co-opt the fighters of armed groups, clans or religious men," says Abbas.
Unlike the Iraqi troops facing them Isis fighters are highly motivated, battle hardened and well-equipped, analysts say.
"It also runs the equivalent of a state. It has all the trappings of a state, just not an internationally recognised one," Douglas Ollivant of the New America Foundation, told the Washington Post.
It runs courts, schools and services, flying its black-and-white flag over every facility it controls. In Raqqa, it even started a consumer protection authority for food standards.
Isis has bolstered its strength by recruiting thousands of foreign volunteers in Syria, some from Europe and the US, and is estimated to have more than 10,000 men under its control. As for resources, it counts large extortion networks in Mosul that predates the US withdrawal and in February it seized control of the financially valuable Conoco gas field, said to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a week, from Jabhat al-Nusra in Deir Ezzor, in Syria.
Now that it has captured Mosul, Isis is in an even stronger position to bolster its claim that it is the leading jihadi group.
"Isis now presents itself as an ideologically superior alternative to al-Qaida within the jihadi community and it has publicly challenged the legitimacy of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri," said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, Doha, in a paper last month. "As such it has increasingly become a transnational movement with immediate objectives far beyond Iraq and Syria."
When Thomas Mair�셲 trial began, many people queried why he was not being prosecuted as a terrorist. A frequent comment, on social media, was that he would have been, had he been a Muslim.
The answer is that Mair was indeed prosecuted as a terrorist, and this was made clear during preliminary hearings. This is the reason that he was tried in London, rather than Yorkshire.
But he was charged with murder, a common-law offence, rather than with an offence under counter-terrorism legislation.
Crown prosecutors did not use the word �쐔errorism�� during the trial because they believed the jurors should be asked simply whether they believed he committed the crime or not, rather than also be expected to consider his motives. The killers of Lee Rigby were prosecuted in the same way.
During the trial, the crown did tell the jury that its case was that the murder was politically or ideologically motivated.
Following the guilty verdict, this allowed the judge to sentence Mair as a murderer who is also a terrorist.
Immediately after the case, the Crown Prosecution Service said that Mair had been convicted �쐎f the terrorist murder of Jo Cox��.
Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, added: �쏮air has offered no explanation for his actions, but the prosecution was able to demonstrate that, motivated by hate, his premeditated crimes were nothing less than acts of terrorism designed to advance his twisted ideology.��
Counter-terrorist units foiled what was described as a jihadist plot to stage a major attack in eastern Belgium on Thursday evening, killing two gunmen and wounding another in a shootout in the town of Verviers near the German border.
The federal prosecutor, Eric Van Der Sypt, denied there was any link with last week�셲 attacks in Paris, but drew parallels with the Charlie Hebdo incident.
He said a terrorist outrage may only have been hours away: �쏷his operation stopped a major terrorist attack from taking place. You could say a second potential Paris has been averted.��
All three gunmen, he said, were Belgian nationals. Police sources told Belgian television stations they had resolved to launch the pre-emptive operation against the terrorist suspects a fortnight ago after bugging the homes and cars of the men who were said to have recently returned from fighting in the war in Syria. The investigation concluded that a large-scale attack was imminent, targeting police stations.
Parallel to the scenes in Verviers, special police units carried out at least a dozen raids elsewhere in Belgium in what appeared to be well-planned operations. They focused on neighbourhoods that are predominantly populated by immigrants in at least four districts in and around Brussels, with explosives reportedly found in the western Brussels area of Anderlecht. There was no police confirmation.
The Belgian prosecutor�셲 office said the terrorist suspects opened fire on police in Verviers when the raid was launched. No civilians or police were hurt in the operation. The wounded suspect, arrested and taken to Brussels, was said to be a Chechen known to the Belgian authorities.
The suspects fired at the special units of the federal police for several minutes, using military weaponry and handguns, before they were �쐍eutralised��, Van Der Sypt said. �쏷he group was on the point of committing a major, imminent attack in Belgium,�� he said.
He described the three heavily armed gunmen as an operational cell that had recently returned from fighting in the war in Syria. They were preparing �쐇mminent terrorist attacks on a grand scale��.
A total of 10 search warrants were issued for synchronised raids in Brussels, as well as Verviers at the end of a surveillance campaign that had lasted several weeks.
The outcomes of the other police search operations were not made public. Belgian journalists accompanying some of the raids said explosives had been found. Van Der Sypt said Belgium�셲 terror alert for the security forces had been raised to its second-highest level.
Witnesses in Verviers said they heard a series of explosions at 5.45pm and then sustained gunfire near the railway station. They looked out of their windows to see the streets full of police vehicles 500 metres from the town mayor�셲 offices and beside the local justice ministry buildings which include a prison facility.
The Belgian police are looking to possible links between a suspected arms dealer arrested in the southern town of Charleroi on Wednesday and Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a policewoman and four hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris last week before being killed in a shootout with French police.
French police had reported they were looking for accomplices of all three gunmen in the Paris attacks �� Coulibaly, Sa챦d and Ch챕rif Kouachi.
Belgium has a history in recent years as a European centre for radical Islamist activity. Authorities and studies by Britain�셲 International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation have estimated that about 300 Belgians have travelled to Syria, the highest per capita concentration in Europe for a country of 11 million. That compares with about 600 so-called foreign fighters who have left the UK.
One of Belgium�셲 best-known jihadist organisations �� Sharia4Belgium �� is at the heart of a huge, ongoing trial in Antwerp in which 46 members of the group have been accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation and brainwashing young men into fighting a holy war in Syria.
Last year, a gunman killed four people at the Jewish museum in Brussels. Belgian authorities say the suspect in that case, French national Mehdi Nemmouche, spent most of 2013 fighting in Syria.
Ha�셢r prison, in the desert south of Riyadh, is not an attractive place. It is surrounded by concrete walls and watchtowers, as befits a facility run by Saudi Arabia�셲 internal security service. It holds terrorists, dissidents and others deemed a danger to the state, whose green and white crossed swords and palm tree emblem is stamped everywhere around the sprawling compound.
Armed guards check vehicles and ID cards in a chicane of barriers by the main gate. Military police jeeps block access from the nearby highway. Two weeks ago, Islamic State threatened to destroy the prison after the execution of 47 men, mostly convicted al-Qaida members. Seven had been inmates at Ha�셢r before they were taken away to be beheaded or shot. Last summer, a young Isis supporter blew himself up outside.
Visiting journalists, however, are welcome, greeted by coffee, cakes and PowerPoint presentations about conditions for the 1,700 prisoners and the programmes to rehabilitate them. It is part of a Saudi government effort to demonstrate its determination to tackle terrorism at a time when Isis, known in Arabic as Daesh, has become a grave threat to the Middle East and far beyond, thousands of miles from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq.
Ha�셢r seems well run. The detention blocks are clean and light, the heavy cell doors painted an incongruous lilac. Pot plants line the corridor. Interrogation rooms are equipped with CCTV, a desk and chairs, and a thick steel ring welded to the floor for securing manacled prisoners. Special rooms, equipped with double beds, are available for conjugal visits. There is even a children�셲 playground.
It is natural to suspect that Ha�셢r, one of five prisons run by the Mabahith security service, is designed to impress and mislead. Human rights groups say conditions are worse in general criminal prisons. Allegations of torture are widespread. �쏮any prisoners do complain about their treatment,�� confided a visiting Saudi from another institution. Inmates, in any event, seemed happy to speak.
�쏮y views have changed,�� said Saud al-Harbi, a 30-year-old with a wispy beard who is coming to the end of a 12-year sentence for attempting to leave the country to fight in Iraq, and for �쐁ontact�� with a wanted man. �쏧 saw the pictures of Abu Ghraib [showing the abuse of Iraqi detainees by US soldiers] and that was why I wanted to go,�� he said. �쏧 was young then.��
Moaz, who has been held without trial for 11 months, was arrested after returning voluntarily from Syria, where he had gone to fight Bashar al-Assad with the Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham. �쏧t turned out to be Muslims killing Muslims,�� he said. �쏷hat wasn�셳 what I wanted.��
Saudi Arabia�셲 tough stance on terrorism sits uneasily with its reputation. The homeland of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers on 11 September 2001, struggles to counter the widely-held belief that it is an incubator and exporter of murderous fanaticism. Its intolerant Salafi or Wahhabi ideology is shared by Daesh, though the jihadis�� thinking includes modern Islamist strands alien to the conservative kingdom. Riyadh dismisses Isis as khawarij or deviant, though beheadings and other sharia punishments are common to both. Daesh uses the takfiri doctrine of excommunication to justify the slaughter of Shias and Yazidis.
Having defeated al-Qaida inside their borders a decade ago, killing and capturing hundreds -including many of those executed on 2 January - the Saudis are fighting Isis, and want to be seen to be doing so. They carried out airstrikes with Barack Obama�셲 anti-Isis coalition in 2014, but abandoned them at the start of the war in Yemen. Last month, the young deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced the creation of an anti-terror alliance of Sunni states, though that was greeted sceptically as more about PR than substance. �쏧t�셲 about building a system,�� Prince Turki al Faisal, the former Saudi intelligence chief, told the Guardian.
Isis clearly threatens Saudi Arabia. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, its self-proclaimed caliph, has singled it out for abuse and designated the Nejd and Hijaz regions as Islamic wilayat or provinces. The ruling Al Saud family is vilified as Al Salul, a reference to a seventh-century figure depicted as outwardly embracing Islam while conspiring against the prophet Muhammad.
In 2015, Isis carried out 15 attacks, which killed 65 people. The worst was a suicide bombing of a Shia mosque in the eastern province village of al-Qudeeh that killed 23. It was presumably mounted to foment sectarian hatred. Most attacks have been by so-called lone wolves. �쏧sis wanted to create an organisation but failed to do so,�� said General Mansour al-Turki, the interior ministry spokesman. �쏷hey could not recruit trained people like al-Qaida.��
Members of the public are encouraged to call the confidential 990 phone line, which gets 180 tips a week about suspected terrorists, Turki said. Less transparent methods are also employed. �쏷he Mabahith listen to everyones�� phones and will arrest you if you even mention the word Daesh,�� said a middle-aged man in Riyadh. �쏷hey really are tough on terrorism,�� said a woman academic. �쏰ther laws are barely enforced in this country.�� Thousands have been arrested under a vaguely defined law.
Saudi Arabia still supports anti-Assad groups in Syria, including the Islamist Jaysh al-Islam. It changed policy, however, over fears of �쐀lowback�� from returning fighters �� a repeat of what happened when officially sanctioned jihadis came back from Afghanistan in the 1990s. In spring 2014 they proscribed Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaida�셲 Syrian affiliate, and banned nationals from fighting abroad. Crackdowns on financing and charity collections have been effective, the control of firebrand preachers less so. Western diplomats increasingly complain of an �쐎utdated stereotype�� of Saudi tolerance for terrorism.
An estimated 3,000 Saudis have been to Syria since 2011, and about 700 have returned home. Officials like to note that in proportion to the country�셲 21m citizens, fewer Saudis fight with Isis than do Tunisians, with their French colonial background, secular republican regime and relatively successful experience of the Arab spring.
�쏽es, there are people in Saudi Arabia who sympathise with Daesh, but there are in other Muslim countries too,�� said Turki. �쏷wo to three thousand Tunisians didn�셳 come out of a so-called Wahhabi upbringing. Or Chechens or Dagenstanis.�� Others talk about �쏝elgiqistan��, a scathing reference to the role of Europeans of Arab or Muslim background in Isis atrocities.
About 5% of the population, or some 500,000 people, support Isis, according to independent polling. An element of this support is admiration for a Sunni group that is uncompromisingly in its fight against Iran and Shias.
Non-official Saudis acknowledge the scale of the problem and blame the influence of extremist clerics in mosques and schools. �쏧 used to oppose capital punishment,�� said Mazen Sudairi, an economist. �쏝ut then I saw what Daesh does and I changed my mind.�� Liberals fret about the effect of uncritical Qur�셙nic teaching. One young mother was horrified when her English-speaking child was denounced as a kafir or non-believer by a classmate, and came home from school asking why his Christian nanny had no religion. �쏻e are a Muslim country but we need to moderate Islam,�� says Fawziya al-Bakr, an education specialist. �쏷he government realises that this violent takfiri ideology is a danger to our own society.��
There is also criticism of the celebrated munasahat or counselling programme, in which teams of social workers, psychologists and imams rehabilitate former militants. It claims a success rate of 85%, including with prisoners who have done time at al-Ha�셢r. �쏻ith Isis, we need to be more open-minded,�� says Saud al-Sarhan, a researcher at the capital�셲 King Faisal Centre. It is a common complaint. �쏱eople who went through the munasahat went on to fight again,�� said Haifa al-Hababi, a Riyadh architect. �쏽ou can�셳 trust people who have been brainwashed.��
Whether by �쐀rainwashing�� or conviction, the jihadis who fight the Saudi state are sticking to their guns. Evidence for that comes from a story about Fares Al Shuwail al-Zahrani, an al-Qaida spiritual leader who was among those most recently executed. Zahrani reportedly rejected attempts by government-approved Islamic scholars to persuade him to renounce his views. But he also refused �쐔o board the sinking ship of Al Saud, for their ship carries nothing but airplanes for America��.
It does not look like a problem that is going to be solved any time soon. �쏶audi Arabia is still fertile ground for radicalisation and there is a sizeable minority that is sympathetic to what Daesh says,�� a Riyadh-based diplomat says. �쏰nly a very small minority would be prepared to act, but the number of terrorist acts is almost as bad as it was in the al-Qaida years. Now they attack Saudi security personnel and Shias, just like in Iraq. Cells are very small, of two, three, four people, and though they are not easy to detect, it is hard for them to act. In the mid-2000s, the authorities were caught off guard. Now they are better prepared. They have arrested a lot of people, though it�셲 a fragile situation. For the time being, they are managing.��
Swedish officials say a man has been detained in connection with a suspected terrorist incident in which a truck drove into pedestrians on a busy shopping street in Stockholm on Friday. Four people were killed and several more were injured. Sweden�셲 prime minister, Stefan L철fven, said: �쏷errorists can never defeat Sweden��
Hello, it�셲 Warren Murray bringing you the Briefing on this very sombre morning.
Twenty-two people are confirmed to have died in an explosion at the Manchester Arena last night. Dozens more people �� 59 at last count �� were injured by the blast, which came just after the end of a show by the pop star Ariana Grande. We are live-blogging all the developments. The blast happened in or around the foyer area, and there was panic as people left the venue. Frantic parents were appealing overnight for information on their children who were in attendance. Many unaccompanied minors had gone to see their pop idol.
The blast happened around 10.30pm, so we are well into our coverage now. Here�셲 a roundup of what we know so far. Theresa May has condemned the �쏿ppalling�� attack, which police say is being treated as a terrorist incident.
The government is in caretaker mode but the Cobra emergency committee will still assemble this morning, chaired by May. Election campaigning has been put on hold. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the Lib Dems�� Tim Farron and Nicola Sturgeon, the Scotland first minister, have been among political leaders voicing their sympathies and concern.
A �쐀roken�� Ariana Grande tweeted after the explosion that she was �쐓o so sorry�� and through the night other figures from entertainment to global politics have sent out words of condolence to those affected. In Manchester itself there has been a big community response via social media, with concertgoers offered rides home and beds for the night.
Tories�� oil money �� Campaigning is suspended today because of developments in Manchester. But the fact remains we have a general election on the way, and all the news that goes along with it. This morning we can tell you that since Theresa May became prime minister, oil industry bosses have poured more than 짙390,000 into the coffers of the Conservative party. The Tories have gone on to produce an election manifesto that promises �쐕nprecedented�� government support for the fossil fuel industry. Meanwhile the U-turn on social care has upended May�셲 campaign, turning �쐓trong and stable�� into �쐗eak and wobbly��.
Facebook files �� We are continuing to lift the lid on how the social network polices its most troubling content. A flood of �쐒evenge porn�� and sextortion saw 54,000 potential cases in a single month, some involving children, with 14,000 accounts taken down as a consequence. Facebook�셲 head of global policy management has defended how it deals with this and other disturbing material. Experts insist Facebook should have �쐍o grey areas�� on right and wrong, especially when it comes to child abuse. Olivia Solon discusses the fine line Facebook is trying to tread on extreme content. Our editorial says that the pervasiveness of Facebook means we need an open and wide-ranging debate on its approach.
Flynn�셲 foreign connections �� The deceptiveness of Donald Trump�셲 short-lived national security adviser about his overseas dealings may date back to the Obama era. Michael Flynn told a congressional committee in February 2016 that his attendance at a Moscow dinner with Vladimir Putin was paid for by US companies when in fact it was funded by Russia Today, a Kremlin propaganda channel, according to Elijah Cummings, senior Democrat on the House oversight committee. Flynn is refusing to comply with a Senate subpoena to hand over documents concerning his foreign activities.
Trump is continuing his first international trip as president, with defeating �쐔errorists and militias�� topping the agenda. �쏧 never mentioned Israel,�� said the president, while in that country �� pretty much confirming a key US intelligence ally as the source of sensitive information that he blabbed to the Russians.
Mafia hit �� An Italian mafia boss has been dramatically gunned down while riding his bicycle down a Sicilian street. Authorities in Palermo say the old-style demise of Giuseppe Dainotti, 67, is proof that the depleted Cosa Nostra remains far from beaten. Dainotti was shot in the head by assailants who pulled alongside him on a scooter, according to witnesses. The murder comes 25 years after the anti-Mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone was killed in a bomb blast on Sicily. Dainotti was understood to be linked to one of the key figures in that murder.
Heart surgery isn�셳 what it used to be �� these days a new valve can be slipped in via an incision to the leg while the patient is still conscious.

US and British security services are assessing the credibility of new threats against western shopping centres issued by Somali-based Islamist terrorists.
A propaganda video released by militant group al-Shabaab on Saturday called for strikes on five shopping centres: Oxford Street and two Westfield malls in London; the Mall of America in Minnesota; and Canada�셲 West Edmonton mall.
US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson said on Sunday he took the threat seriously and urged people to take care and be vigilant while shopping.
The 77-minute video was released online by the media wing of al-Shabaab, the Somali-based affiliate of al-Qaida.It urged followers to carry out attacks on �쏛merican and Jewish-owned�� shopping centres similar to the siege at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013, in which 67 people were killed and more than 175 wounded by four gunmen.�쏻e call upon our Muslim brothers, particularly those in the west, to answer the call of Allah and target the disbelievers wherever they are,�� a black man in a military-style jacket, with his face covered by a headscarf, says in the video.
The man goes on to suggest an attack on the Mall of America, the biggest retail centre in the US. Map coordinates for the mall were displayed on screen.The mall is a prominent feature of the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area, home to the country�셲 largest population of Somali immigrants. Several men are known to have travelled from the region to the Middle East and Africa in recent years to fight with Islamist militants.
A statement from the Mall of America said its bosses were aware of the video and had implemented extra security measures.
�쏻e will continue to monitor events with the help of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies,�� said the statement. �쏛s always, we take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately.��
The video also proposed strikes on Oxford Street in central London as well as Westfield malls in Stratford, east London and White City, west London.It singled out as another target the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, which is the largest shopping mall in North America.
�쏻hat would be the implications of such an attack?�� the narrator asked. �쏰ne could only imagine.��
Asked how seriously he was taking the new threat, Johnson told CNN: �쏧�셫 very concerned about the serious potential threat of independent actors here in the United States.
�쏛ny time a terrorist organisation calls for an attack on a specific place, we�셶e got to take that seriously.��
A spokesman for the Metropolitan police (MPS) said: �쏷he MPS counter-terrorism command is aware of the video and is assessing the content.�쏻e remind the public that downloading extremist material may constitute an offence.��

A mosque used by the Berlin Christmas market truck attacker, Anis Amri, has been shut down by German authorities amid a series of police raids in the hunt for other radical Islamists.
The prayer rooms of the Fussilet 33 mosque in the central district of Moabit was a known meeting place for men and women who moved in Islamist circles.
More than 460 police officers swept 24 other locations across the city in the early hours of Tuesday morning in raids linked to activities at the mosque, where it is suspected money was regularly collected to fund terror attacks in Syria.Amri, who carried out the attack on 19 December in which 12 people died and more than 50 were injured, was a regular visitor to Fussilet 33, along with other Islamists police believe were willing to carry out further terrorist attacks.
Members of the mosque �� mostly of Turkish or Caucasian origin �� were allegedly radicalised there and recruited to fight for Islamic State in Syria.
Officers had observed the mosque entrance using a hidden camera from a police station located opposite, a spokesman said. Communication between various members of the Fussilet 33 association had also been under surveillance.
Among the properties searched on Tuesday were office spaces, flats, and six cells in two prisons. No arrests are believed to have been made.
Speaking to the Associated Press, Berlin�셲 top security official said authorities had seized funds belonging to Fussilet 33, shut down its website and imposed a blanket ban to prevent the organisation from establishing itself under a different name or location.
�쏧t was necessary to ban the organisation and all successor organisations to stop it once and for all,�� Andreas Geisel said �쏱eople who preach hate have no place in this city.��
Amri fled Berlin after the attack and was apprehended on the outskirts of Milan four days later by two police officers, one of whom shot him dead.
Authorities announced they would finally close the mosque this month after several attempts to do so since 2015. Given notice of the closure, the organisers moved out last week and cancelled their rental contract with the landlord.
The door has been boarded up and a notice in German and Turkish reads: �쏷his mosque is now closed.��
Hundreds of people have rallied in Budapest against government plans to bring in anti-terror measures including restrictions on the internet and curfews.
�쏷he plan would put an end to democracy once and for all,�� protest organiser Lajos Bokros told the crowd of hundreds in front of the Hungarian parliament.
According to a draft leaked to the media, the government wants to amend the constitution by creating a new category of emergency �� �쐔error threat situation�� �� that if declared would enable it to issue decrees, suspend certain laws and modify others.
Among some 30 proposed changes are controls on the internet, deployment of the army domestically, closing of borders and the imposition of curfews in areas affected by a terrorist threat.
Critics including several opposition parties and rights groups say a vaguely defined �쐔error threat�� could allow the government to clamp down on civil liberties.
�쏧t�셲 happened in our history before and we�셱e afraid it will happen again �� that at any given time the government can allow itself to restrict our rights,�� said Gyorgy Magyar, a lawyer who spoke at the rally.
The proposals will be debated in parliament next month, according to Gergely Gulyas, a lawmaker with prime minister Viktor Orban�셲 ruling rightwing Fidesz party.
In a newspaper interview Gulyas said talks with opposition parties were continuing and dismissed accusations that Fidesz wanted to seize �쐄ull powers��.
�쏷he government�셲 duty is to protect citizens from terrorism,�� he said.
Since coming to power in 2010 Orban�셲 government has often been accused of dismantling democratic checks and balances.
After losing a parliamentary supermajority in February 2015 it needs the support of at least some opposition lawmakers to pass constitutional amendments.
The storming of a military school in Peshawar by the Taliban, who killed 132 children and nine teachers, horrified the world. But it wasn�셳 an isolated event; attacks on educational institutions seem to be increasing. Schools and universities everywhere �� from Nigeria to Kenya and Afghanistan �� have been targeted in recent years.
Last year the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) published a report that documented deliberate attacks on schools, universities, their students and staff in order to provide data that could develop more effective policy in this area. It analysed conflicts in 70 countries between 2009 and 2013 and categorised how far they�셝 been affected. For example, places categorised as �쐖ery heavily affected�� had experienced more than 1,000 attacks on schools and universities over the four years. These included arson, missile strikes, looting and armed occupation by army forces or guerrilla groups.
The director of the GCPEA, Diya Nijhowne, said: �쏮ilitary strategy now all too commonly involves deliberately bombing schools and universities and murdering, maiming, abducting and raping their students and staff.��
The GCPEA research is based on extensive data gathered from 2009��12 and key incidents in the first nine months of 2013. Data from a wide range of sources was analysed, including United Nations (UN) monitoring and and media reports. The information was cross-checked for accuracy but the report notes that it was not possible to verify every incident.
Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Syria were worst affected, according the the GCPEA report. These places had experienced 1,000 or more attacks on schools, universities, staff and students or there had been 1,000 or more attacks on personnel including students, teachers and other educational staff, or facilities had been used for military purposes.
One of the most dangerous countries in which to be a teacher is Colombia. Between 2009 and 2012, 140 teachers were murdered in the country and more than 1,000 received death threats.
Teachers in Colombia are targeted for a number of reasons. �쏶ome teachers in remote areas, where armed non-state groups are strong and schools are the only visible presence of the state, are accused by illegal armed groups of collaborating with the enemy,�� the report notes. Educators are also targeted for trying to lead community efforts to protect children from sexual violence and child recruitment, as well as other efforts to challenge the armed groups�� activities.
Another report by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, published late last year, analysed terror attacks on schools and colleges around the world from 1970 to 2013. Researchers at the University of Maryland analysed data from the Global Terrorism Database and news media.
The report included attacks against schools, teachers or guards protecting school sites, as well as attacks against university professors and teaching staff, and school buses. It excludes attacks against military schools.
Terrorism in this context was defined as: �쏷he threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.��
Between 1970 and 2013 there were more than 3,400 terrorist attacks targeting educational institutions across 110 countries. There was a sharp increase in attacks in 2004.
The report notes that many attacks on educational targets were less likely to cause deaths. More than 70% of all terrorist attacks on educational targets between 1970 and 2013 (2,365 attacks) caused no deaths. This is because many assaults were on unoccupied school and university buildings and intended to intimidate communities rather than kill or injure.The country with the most terrorist attacks on educational institutions was Pakistan, where 753 were targeted. Of these incidents, 96% (724) took place between 2004 and 2013. However, unlike the attack in Peshawar, most were not lethal. Russia, Iraq, and Nigeria experienced more fatal attacks on educational targets than Pakistan.
In Nigeria the radical group Boko Haram has been deliberately attacking educational institutions since 2008. The table below shows the tactics of terrorist attacks in Nigeria from 1988��2013.
The study also shows that such attacks are not restricted to the developing world. There were a number of incidents in the 70s in America involving a range of groups, such as radical students and opponents of the Vietnam war.
The reported motives for attacks are varied, according to the GCPEA report. They include everything from destroying symbols of government control to blocking girls�� education. In some incidents there are multiple reasons for the attack.
Erin Miller, programme manager at the Global Terrorism Database, said: �쏷he question about why terrorists attack educational institutions is difficult because there are likely many reasons and they�셱e not all the same for every perpetrator.�� She adds that motives may include the intention to shock or gain attention and educational institutions being seen as �쐓oft�� targets because they are often without a great deal of security.�쏷here needs to be better monitoring and reporting of attacks on education,�� says Nijhowne. She adds that there also needs to be accountability for attacks, with perpetrators brought to justice.
World at School �� an international movement that co-ordinates the efforts of teachers, businesses, faith groups and many others to ensure education is a global priority �� is campaigning for the UN security council take urgent action to protect children in schools.
It also wants all governments to support a new declaration on safe schools led by the Norwegian government. This would outlaw attacks on schools, colleges and universities as crimes against humanity. Finally, the movement wants funding for schools in conflict situations increased; currently only 1% of humanitarian aid is spent on education.
Two suicide bombers have blown themselves up in a busy market in central Baghdad, in back-to-back explosions that killed at least 38 people, Iraqi health and police officials said.
The bombings were the most serious attacks in the capital since the prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, declared victory over Islamic State a little over a month ago, capping a three-year campaign to reclaim territory from the terror group in Iraq.
It raises questions about the government�셲 readiness to deal with the security challenges posed by the group�셲 retreat to its insurgent roots, ahead of elections expected in May.
The attackers struck during rush hour on Monday morning in Tayran Square, which is usually crowded with labourers seeking work. The explosions wounded at least 105 people, the officials said.
The death toll has grown since earlier reports from the health ministry, which said 26 people had been killed, and the interior ministry, which said 16 had died. Both said dozens had been wounded.
Ambulances rushed to the scene as security forces sealed off the area. Slippers could be seen scattered about on the blood-stained pavement as cleaners hurried to clear the debris. Photographs posted on social media showed dead bodies and body parts.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but it bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State, which has claimed many such atrocities in the past.
�쏧t was a tremendous, I felt the ground shaking under my feet,�� said Munthir Falah, a secondhand clothes vendor whose chest and right leg were pierced by shrapnel.
�쏻e were expecting this [attack] because of the upcoming elections,�� said Einas Khalil, a Baghdad housewife, who blamed the security breakdown on the country�셲 feuding politicians. �쏣very four years we have to live through this suffering because of political differences and disagreements.��
The Iraqi parliament speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, denounced the attack as a �쐁owardly act against innocent people�� and called on the government to take all necessary security measures. Abadi met security officials in charge of Baghdad, ordering them to root out militant sleeper cells, according to a brief statement issued by his office.
There have been significantly fewer large attacks in Baghdad and other parts of country since security forces retook nearly all territory once held by Isis militants.
Iraqi and US officials had warned that Isis would continue with insurgent-style attacks even after the Iraqi military and US-led coalition succeeded in ousting the group across the country.
The cost of victory has been nearly incalculable as the three-year Isis insurgency devastated much of northern and western Iraq.
On Sunday, Abadi announced a new political coalition, the Victory Alliance, to contest the upcoming elections. The coalition includes groups close to Tehran.
Iran commands great influence in Iraq through proxy militias that have taken part in the campaign against Isis, and which form the core of the Popular Mobilisation Units, also known as the Hashd al-Shaabi, formed from volunteers after the initial Isis advance in 2014.
Abadi is credited with leading Iraq and rebuilding the country�셲 military during three tumultuous years as prime minister in which the government slowly clawed back cities such as Ramadi, Fallujah, Tikrit and Mosul from Isis.
But now he faces great challenges in rebuilding the cities devastated in the military campaigns, ensuring that his government�셲 policies do not alienate the country�셲 Sunni minority, and addressing the central authorities�� relationship with the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly last year for independence from Baghdad in a non-binding referendum.
The government has proposed holding elections on 12 May, but parliament must approve the date. Sunni leaders have called for the vote to be delayed until the 3 million people still displaced from the fighting can return to their homes.
David Cameron and Nick Clegg will embark on intensive negotiations over the weekend to try to agree a fresh round of measures to tackle the threat posed by terror suspects in Britain.
The prime minister announced that he would unveil new measures in a statement to parliament on Monday at a televised press conference, on the day that the terror threat to the UK was raised from substantial to severe.
Speaking at Downing Street after his return from a pre-referendum trip to Scotland, Cameron said: "It is becoming clear that there are some gaps in our armoury and we need to strengthen them. We need to do more to stop people travelling, to stop those who do go from returning and to deal decisively with those who are already here."
He was speaking amid fears that extremists aligned to Islamic State (Isis) plan to return from the conflict-torn region to mount attacks in western Europe. Cameron said that Isis and other extremists posed a "generational struggle" for the UK and other western countries.
Cameron highlighted plans to make it easier to revoke passports for British citizens amid concerns that this power has only been used on 23 occasions in the last year while up to 250 jihadis are thought to have returned to Britain from Iraq and Syria.
It is understood that ministers will embed this power in legislation after it was introduced in April last year through royal prerogative executive powers. The move is designed to make it easier to prevent suspects from travelling to Syria and Iraq. There are separate powers to strip citizenship from UK citizens with dual citizenship.
Cameron did not provide more details of his plans. Government sources later confirmed that he and Clegg will have further discussions over the weekend to reach agreement.
It is understood that one key area, where Cameron and his deputy have yet to reach agreement, is on terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs), which replaced control orders. Cameron and Clegg are looking closer at the recommendation by David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who called for two changes in his annual report in March.
Anderson recommended a strengthening of "locational constraints" on those subject to TPIMs to ban them from some areas or to restore the power to relocate them to specific areas. He also called for powers to force those subject to TPIMs to attend probation service meetings.
Cameron said the beheading of James Foley showed the need to act, though the decision to raise the terror threat alert was not related to the video that featured his killing.
He said: "It was clear evidence, not that any more was needed, that this is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore. The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK."
He outlined the changes after the home secretary, Theresa May, announced the raising of the terror threat level. May said that raising it from substantial to severe meant that an attack was highly likely, though she said there was no evidence to suggest an attack was imminent.
She said the decision was "related to developments in Syria and Iraq, where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the west". She said some of the plots were likely to involve foreign fighters who had travelled to the Middle East from Britain and Europe to take part in the conflicts there.
The threat level last stood at severe more than three years ago and it was reduced to substantial on 11 July 2011. Severe is the fourth level in the five-tier system of alert categories that have been used by the government since 2006 to warn of terrorist activity. The higher level is critical, which is used when an attack is expected imminently.
May said the decision to raise the threat level had been taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. "We face a real and serious threat in the UK from international terrorism. I would urge the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police," she said.
Downing Street knew before the defection of the Tory MP Douglas Carswell to Ukip on Thursday that the terror level threat would be raised. It made preparations for Cameron's statement before the Carswell announcement, indicating that the press conference was not an attempt to deflect attention from Tory divisions on Europe.
Cameron issued a dire warning of the threat posed by extremists at home and abroad as he spoke of the need to tackle support for violent and extremist ideology. He said: "In Afghanistan the Taliban were prepared to play host to al Qaida, the terrorist organisation.With IS we are facing a terrorist organisation not being hosted in a country but seeking to establish and then violently expand its own terrorist state.
"With designs on expanding to Jordan, Lebanon, right up to the Turkish border, we could be facing a terrorist state on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a Nato member."
The prime minister made clear that he would be relentless in tackling supporters of extremist ideology. He said: "The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK.
"The terrorist threat was not created by the Iraq war 10 years ago. it existed even before the horrific attacks on 9/11, themselves some time before the war.
"This threat cannot be solved simply by dealing with perceived grievances over Western foreign policy. Nor can it be dealt with by addressing poverty, dictatorship or instability in the region - as important as these things are.
"The root cause of this threat to our security is quite clear. It is a poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism that is condemned by all faiths and faith leaders."
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that Labour would work with the government to strengthen TPIMs. She said: "The prime minister is right to say this threat is based on a poisonous ideology of warped Islamic extremism that is condemned by all faiths and all faith leaders.
"The head of MI5 warned last year that the threat from Islamist extremism was becoming 'more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable', as so many Britons were joining the conflict. I have said to the Home Secretary that we stand ready to work with the Government on any measures that may be needed to respond to the threat."
What would you do? The company along the corridor in your office building is coming under attack. You�셶e seen masked men with guns arrive outside, come into the building, heard them shooting the maintenance man. Would you go across to warn your neighbours and risk meeting the killers on the way? Or would you call the police and barricade your own door?
TV writer-director Martin Boudot did the latter, and has had to live with it ever since. �쏰ften I ask myself: why didn�셳 I call Charlie before calling the cops?�� he says. �쏻hy didn�셳 I go and warn them when I saw the gunmen outside? If it happened again, I wouldn�셳 wait. I�셝 act straight away. Sometimes I just wish I could save someone. In my dreams, I save lives, but that day I saved no one.��
Boudot beating himself up like this is one of many numbing moments in Dan Reed�셲 haunting documentary Three Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks (BBC2). You might think you knew everything there was to know about the massacre; you read about and watched it all a year ago, as it unfolded: the shootings and the subsequent manhunt for the Kouachi brothers that culminated in a showdown at a printworks in Dammartin-en-Go챘le, and the concurrent siege at the kosher Hyper Cacher in Porte de Vincennes in which a further four people were murdered. But you won�셳 have seen it like this, the timeline filled in meticulously, and in such extraordinary detail.
A story such as this often requires time for the dust and the chaos to settle before it can be seen with any kind of clarity. Time �� and a load of work. Here, there are interviews with virtually everyone: survivors; police; special forces; negotiators; snipers; the shelf-stacker who escaped from the supermarket and helped the police with its layout; and people randomly caught up, such as the German tourist who bumped into the Kouachis stopping off for snacks at a petrol station (it would be comedic if it wasn�셳 engulfed in so much bloodshed and tragedy). There is news footage, and CCTV footage, and phone footage, and Boudot�셲 footage from the roof where he and his colleagues had gone to escape the gunmen, though not the sound of sickening percussive thuds from below as their neighbours were executed. Plus the recordings of the Kouachis and Hyper Cacher hostage-taker Amedy Coulibaly speaking �� with steely calm �� to the press.
From the carnage, the mayhem and the tears emerge stories of heartbreaking humanity and unexpected tenderness. The quiet voice of a survivor in the Charlie bloodbath to a trauma doctor: �쏮onsieur, s�셢l vous pla챤t, aidez moi.�� The driver, suddenly carjacked with a gun to his head, thinking to rescue his dog from the back seat of the car. The man who felt like he was coming to life, born again, after getting out of the supermarket alive. Even, at the Dammartin printworks, owner Michel Catalano bandaging the wound of his captor: not because he was forced to but because he offered; then doing it again because the injured terrorist said it was too tight. Humanity is a stubborn bugger, not so easily destroyed.
Have the more recent, more random, more bloody Paris attacks overshadowed Charlie Hebdo? Not a bit. It�셲 just a continuation of that same timeline. The same city �� and the same ideas �� under attack, the same story. Even some of the characters are the same; just hours after Jean-Pierre Tourtier, the emergency doctor quickly on the scene at Charlie Hebdo, was interviewed for this, he was called to save lives at the Bataclan. Not just three days of terror, but a year of it, and almost certainly more.
�쏧 see no reason to be optimistic,�� says a security expert, chillingly. Maybe that question �� which was impossible not to ask yourself while watching �� should be not what would you do, but what will you do?
The Story of Scottish Art (BBC4)? I think I know that one: once upon a time there was a big old deer, with pointy horns, in a glen, who got painted, in oils �� No? There�셲 more?
There are ancient gastropodous squiggles; and priapic stones, standing in proud circles like neolithic daisychains; and carved stone balls, to hold, to fondle in awe, to curl, who knows what for; and intricate Celtic crosses. That�셲 just the first part of the story; there are three more chapters to come, and if anyone can get your Scottish art juices going, it�셲 Lachlan Goudie. Bring on the Enlightenment.
I�셫 watching Trust Me I�셫 a Doctor (BBC2), which is looking at shaking off festive excess, while standing up. And performing little muscle toning squats, as demonstrated by Michael Mosley �� Very good, that should do it; back to the sofa for the rest of 2016.
Italian police have arrested two men in the southern port of Bari and a third in Milan following an investigation into an alleged terror cell said to have been plotting possible terror attacks in Italy and the UK.
Investigators did not say they had evidence that an attack was imminent. But the cell is alleged to have been scoping out sites for a potential attack, including in Bari and London, with a specific focus on airports, ports, police vehicles and hotels, according to Italian press reports.
The two men arrested in Bari �� both Afghan �� were named as Hakim Nasiri, 23, who is accused of involvement in international terrorism, and Gulistan Ahmadzai, who has been charged with aiding illegal immigration. The third man, a Pakistani also suspected of aiding illegal immigration, was detained in Milan later in the day.
Two other suspects, both residents of Bari, are still at large and believed to be in Afghanistan.
Italy�셲 interior minister, Angelino Alfano, said the arrests proved that Italy�셲 counter-terrorism laws and investigations were effective. He said one of the suspects had been looking at �쐓ensitive targets��.
While Alfano limited his statement to a potential threat against Bari, multiple Italian newspapers, citing Italian investigators involved in the inquiry, described a much broader potential threat, saying the suspects were allegedly prepared to offer logistical support to an international terror group linked to Islamic State.
The investigation focused on possible targets in Rome and London, according to an arrest warrant.
Nasiri was staying in an asylum centre and was offered protective status �� similar to attaining refugee status �� last month. Ahmadzai was granted protective status in September 2011 and lives in Foggia.
Ansa reported that police found images of weapons, Taliban militants, radical Islamist prayers and indoctrination materials.
The investigation was launched in December after a routine patrol noted that four Afghans �� two of whom had residence permits and two of whom were asylum seekers �� were taking photographs of a shopping centre, according to a police statement.
Investigators began tracking the men, and one of them was found to be downloading jihadi photographs and pictures of a Taliban leader.
One of the arrested men is believed to have sought to travel to Calais. One suspect not yet apprehended is alleged to have sought access to an assault rifle in the UK on behalf of one of the arrested men.
Obesity is a greater burden on the UK�셲 economy than armed violence, war and terrorism, costing the country nearly 짙47bn a year, a report has found.
The study, commissioned by consultancy firm McKinsey and Company, reveals obesity has the second-largest economic impact on the UK behind smoking, generating an annual loss equivalent to 3% of GDP.
More than 2.1 billion people around the world �� or nearly 30% of the global population �� are overweight or obese, with the figure set to rise to almost half of the world�셲 adult population by 2030, according to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), which produced the report.
It has called for a co-ordinated response from governments, retailers, restaurants and food and drink manufacturers to address what it calls the �쐅lobal obesity crisis��.
A series of 44 interventions could bring 20% of overweight or obese people in UK back to normal weight within five to 10 years, the report says.
This would save around 짙16bn a year in the UK, including an annual saving of about 짙766m in the NHS, according to the study.
The report says: �쏰besity is a major global economic problem caused by a multitude of factors. Today obesity is jostling with armed conflict and smoking in terms of having the greatest human-generated global economic impact.
�쏷he global economic impact of obesity is increasing. The evidence suggests that the economic and societal impact of obesity is deep and lasting.��
The report finds the economic impact from smoking in the UK was 짙57bn in 2012, or 3.6% of GDP, while the country suffered a 짙43bn annual loss from armed violence, war and terrorism, or 2.5% of GDP.
In the UK government efforts to tackle obesity were �쐔oo fragmented to be effective��, while investment in obesity prevention was �쐒elatively low given the scale of the problem��, the report says.
The UK spends less than 짙638m a year on obesity prevention programmes �� about 1% of the social cost, the study finds.
But the country spends about 짙6bn a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further 짙10 billion on diabetes.
Meanwhile the cost of obesity and diabetes to the NHS is equivalent to the UK�셲 combined �쐏rotection�� budget for the police and fire services, law courts, and prisons.
The current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the NHS could increase from between 짙6bn and 짙8bn in 2015 to between 짙10bn and 짙12bn in 2030, the study finds.
The recommended interventions to reduce the cost of obesity include portion control in fast food packaged goods; investing in parental education; introducing healthy meals in schools and workplaces; changing the school curriculum to include more physical exercise; and encouraging more physical activities by introducing bicycle lanes.
MGI director Richard Dobbs said: �쏣fforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now. Yet obesity is a systemic issue, born of many interlocking factors, and only a systemic response will do.��
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England (PHE), said: �쏰verweight and obesity is a complex problem which requires action across individual and societal levels involving industry, national and local government and the voluntary sector. There is no single silver-bullet solution.
�쏷oday 25% of the nation is obese and 37% is overweight. If we reduce obesity to 1993 levels, where 15% of the population were obese, we will avoid five million disease cases and save the NHS alone an additional 짙1.2bn by 2034.
�쏱HE will continue to support local authorities to provide effective weight management services, to influence the regulation of fast food outlets and provide healthier catering in hospitals and schools, which will all help people to lose weight.��
The death toll after three days of violence in Mumbai rose past 150 as shroud-wrapped bodies were ferried last night from the smouldering remains of a luxury hotel and an ultra-orthodox Jewish centre freed from the clutches of Islamist militants.
More than 300 people were injured in the battles that began when gunmen took to the streets of India's financial capital late on Wednesday, spraying bullets and throwing grenades to spread terror across the city.
They ended up invading several Mumbai landmarks: two luxury hotels and a Jewish house of prayer - a new phenomenon for India, but a familiar pattern from attacks inspired by militant Islamism.
Yesterday the death toll of foreigners reached 16, including a father and daughter from the US in India for a yoga retreat. British officials said at least 100 Britons were caught up in the attacks, with more than 40 held hostage or forced to hide in their rooms to save their lives.
Last night Indian forces fired grenades at the Taj Mahal hotel where at least one gunman continued to elude Indian commandos through the maze of corridors and rooms. The militant was believed to have been using human shields to taunt and evade Indian security forces, and a bag captured from the gunmen revealed a stockpile meant for a long siege: 400 rounds of ammunition, grenades, identity cards, rations, $1,000 (짙650) in cash and international credit cards.
A member of India's elite marine commando unit said the scene inside the hotel was grim. The commander, his face disguised by a black scarf and sunglasses, said he had seen 50 bodies, including 12 to 15 in one room. "Bodies were strewn all over the place, and there was blood everywhere," he said.
Indian commandos had cleared the last of the gunmen from the Oberoi-Trident hotel early yesterday afternoon, freeing 200 exhausted guests.
Special forces had less luck in the battle for the Jewish centre. Their raid on the premises began with a team abseiling from a helicopter on to the roof of the apartment complex but ended with five hostages dead. Television pictures last night showed dead bodies spread across beds in the building.
Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, said last night the bodies of three women and three men were found, including some who had been bound.
India pointed the finger of blame at Pakistan, with the foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, saying "initial evidence" showed "elements with links to Pakistan are involved". India has long blamed its neighbour for nurturing jihadi groups to fight in the disputed Kashmir region.
In 2006 another coordinated bombing spree on Mumbai's railway killed more than 180 commuters. Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamist group patronised by Pakistan in the past, was blamed at the time.
But Indian ministers yesterday appeared to be saying that they were accusing Pakistan-based groups of staging the attack, and not the state itself.
Pakistan has denied involvement and condemned the attacks. The country's president, Asif Ali Zardari, telephoned India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to reassure him of his support in the battle against terrorism. Zardari condemned the attacks, saying "non-state actors" were responsible.
In an unprecedented step, Pakistan agreed to let the head of the its military's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency go to India to share information with investigators there.
The British government, meanwhile, was investigating whether two of the attackers could be British citizens of Pakistani origin. Asked about the possibility of any British link to the Mumbai attacks, Gordon Brown said it was "too early" to reach any conclusions.
By yesterday the five-star hotel was into its third day as the centre of a war zone with ambulances parked outside to ferry away the dead and the injured. One military chief said up to 15 bodies may be inside one room alone. Special forces were firing into the old part of the hotel building, and were having to take cover from gun and grenade attacks from terrorists still at large.
All day, gun battles broke out between commandos trying to flush out the last terrorists in the building. The terrorists were so well equipped that, more than 48 hours after the siege began, they were able to return fire and lob grenades at the Indian forces trying to kill and capture them. The number of terrorists still holed up in the Taj was unclear. They were believed to be on the first floor of the old building and medics at the scene said that hostages were being held and used as human shields. Outside, troops took cover behind vehicles and trees as gun battles continued for hours and smoke billowed from the hotel.
Ambulances parked outside the Taj were waiting for the casualties. Neville Bharucha, of the Parsi ambulance service, said bodies were inside the hotel but could not be recovered because terrorists were still at large. He had been briefed by security officials about the situation inside, he said: "There are dead bodies in the old Taj building. They are all lying there, they are the guests. We can't recover the bodies because of the terrorists. They are still holding human shields."
The chief of an Indian commando unit at the hotel said the terrorists were "very determined and remorseless", and ready for a long siege. He said the Taj was filled with terrified civilians, making it very difficult for the commandos to fire on the gunmen. "To try to avoid civilian casualties we had to be so much more careful," he said, adding that the hotel was a grim sight.
Sajjad Karim, 38, a Tory MEP staying at the hotel who hid from the gunmen in a barricaded basement room, landed back in Britain yesterday, describing the ordeal as "one you can never prepare yourself for". Speaking at Manchester airport, as he hugged his children aged eight and six, he said: "Seeing that you weren't alone in the situation and there were very many other people with you in the same desperate circumstances - you give one another strength."
Indian special forces yesterday ended the siege at the Oberoi hotel and said 24 bodies had been found.
Commandos killed two militants and freed 143 guests, including Britons and other foreign nationals. About 40 Britons were believed to have been caught up in the attack on the Oberoi, and consular officials quickly took them away from the scene as the siege ended.
"I'm going home, I'm going to see my wife," said Mark Abell, with a huge smile on his face after emerging from the hotel. He had locked himself in his room during the siege. "These people here have been fantastic, the Indian authorities, the hotel staff," he said.
JK Dutt, director general of India's elite national security guard, said: "The hotel is under our control."
Well-dressed foreigners and Indians, some dragging their suitcases, were escorted into waiting buses and cars.
One foreign member of the hotel staff left holding a baby in his arms, others wept as police showed them photographs of dead relatives for identification. As the evening wore on some relatives were allowed into the Oberoi to search for missing loved ones. A delegation from the United States consulate also entered the hotel to search for its nationals.
Throughout the day crowds grew around Nariman House, Mumbai's Jewish centre, jostling for a view of the yellow five-storey building. Every hour or so police cleared the street, and just as quickly people filled back into the spaces along the alleys, lanes, rooftops and roads.
They came to watch Indian commandos dropping from a helicopter about 20 metres on to the roof and the deadly denouement of an assault on the terrorists who lay within.
A pattern had emerged early on with bursts of gunfire from pistols, machine-guns and sniper rifles lasting 15 minutes, cascading into the facade and windows of the building before an eerie silence was restored for half an hour. This continued until evening fell. Then the commandos finally entered the shell of the building.
Snipers continued shooting before a succession of rockets were fired. At 5.30pm there was a huge explosion on the fourth floor, sending the crowds to the ground. Commandos then proceeded into the flat, emptying ammunition clips in quick succession. The siege of Nariman House was over. Outside the street filled with cheering people chanting "India is free" and "long live mother India".
Six young Israelis from Zaka, the group responsible for mopping up blood and body parts from the scenes of suicide attacks in Israel, arrived. It was then confirmed that five hostages were dead. They included Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, the Brooklyn-based directors of Chabad-Lubavitch of Mumbai. The remains of two gunmen were also found.
Tunisian museum security guards failed to search two heavily armed gunmen before they shot dead 22 people including a British woman in a terrorist attack, an inquest heard.
Sally Adey was killed by a bullet that went through her handbag and into her stomach during a visit to Bardo National Museum in Tunis on 18 March last year.
The 57-year-old from Caynton, near Shifnal in Shropshire, died in the chaos as her husband Robert tried to pull her to safety.
He described the panic as two gunmen burst into a hall firing, and minutes later how his dying wife said: �쏰h God Rob, I�셫 hit.��
In the minutes that followed, he held his wife and daubed his own face with blood to dupe the gunmen. Later, while hiding with other tourists in an enclosed balcony, a bullet fired from outside by Tunisian security forces left �쏿 smoking hole�� near his head.
At the inquest into Adey�셲 death, the senior Shropshire coroner, John Ellery, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.
During the hearing, CCTV was shown of the first moments of panic as gunfire and explosions echoed through the museum�셲 white stone corridors, sparking terror and confusion among dozens of tourists. Graphic photographs from the scene pictured the attackers after they were shot dead by security forces in a stairwell.
Images were also shown of the arsenal they brought, including AK47 assault rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and grenades.
Yassine Laabidi and Jabeur Khachnaoui were recorded calmly moving through the museum, and were later heard firing single shots and controlled bursts of gunfire at fleeing tourists.
Adey was among 22 victims killed in the attack �� 17 of whom were from the MSC Splendida cruise liner on which she had been travelling �� while her 52-year-old husband was wounded.
Neither he nor the couple�셲 two grown-up children was at the hearing at Shropshire coroner�셲 court.
Ellery heard evidence from DI Simon Harding, of the Metropolitan police�셲 SO15 counter-terrorism command. Harding said the attackers, trained at a jihadi camp in Libya, walked to the museum�셲 main gates, where they were allowed through.
He said: �쏛lthough there was a security presence on the main gate, it was not policy to search pedestrians or all vehicles and Laabidi and Khachnaoui passed through carrying bags of weapons completely unaffected. They began shooting tourists in and around the coaches.��
Nine tourists were shot dead in the car park before the gunmen entered the museum, firing and making their way upstairs to the Carthage Hall, where the Adeys had been taking photos minutes before.
Harding described how Adey, a retired solicitor, and her husband ran for the doorway and were only able to get through �쐗hen those in front started to drop��.
Robert Adey recounted the couple �쐋ooking at each other, not moving�� as they could not believe what was happening.
His account was read aloud: �쏛 couple of people were hit to Mr Adey�셲 left and a bullet hit the wall above his head but as people were falling down, he managed to get through (the doorway).
He shoved Sally into the bay window balcony and pushed her in. Just as he grabbed Sally to pull her towards him, she was hit.
�쏶ally said something to him ... it was words to the effect of, �쁎h God Rob, I�셫 hit��. As she slid down, he slid with her and just held her.��
Harding said the continuing police investigation pointed to the al-Qaida and Islamic State-linked jihadi group Ansar al-Sharia being behind the atrocity, and that it was linked to the Tunisia beach attacks in Sousse in June last year.
He said there had been no evidence an attack was �쐒easonably foreseeable�� at the time.
The UK is leading a Europe-wide �쐒ace to the bottom�� with Orwellian counter-terrorism measures that seriously threaten human rights, according to a comparative survey of security laws by Amnesty International.
A 70-page report, entitled Dangerously disproportionate: The ever-expanding national security state in Europe, alleges that Britain has introduced powers in the name of national security that are �쏿mong the most draconian in the EU��.
In more than half the areas of concern highlighted by the report, the UK is judged to be at one end of the spectrum in relation to regulations on �쐌ass surveillance��, use of �쐂iplomatic assurances�� to deport people where there is a risk of torture, stripping people of their nationality, controlling their movement and detaining without charge or sufficient legal process.
Amnesty�셲 stark assessment is a response to widespread changes in counter-terror laws across Europe, enacted in the wake of numerous, Islamic State-inspired attacks. It follows the UK parliament�셲 vote for the Investigatory Powers Act, nicknamed the snooper�셲 charter.
Amnesty�셲 report �� based on research comparing 14 EU countries �� is at odds with the latest annual report produced by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, who concluded: �쏷he terrorism acts, as refined by parliament and by the influence of the courts, are a broadly proportionate reaction to the current threat.
�쏝ased on my own observations over six years, the hostile narrative of power-hungry security services, police insensitivity to community concerns and laws constantly being ratcheted up to new levels of oppression is, quite simply, false.��
The Amnesty report, however, says that many EU countries have joined the ranks of surveillance states as new laws have enabled intrusive mass surveillance powers.
Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International UK, said: �쏷he Big Brother surveillance state that George Orwell warned of back in 1949 is alive and dangerously well in Europe today. Governments, including the UK, are not far off creating societies in which freedom is the exception and fear the rule, which should be of deep concern to us all.
�쏛fter a series of horrific terrorist attacks across Europe, EU governments have rushed through a raft of repressive laws. There is an obvious and urgent need to protect people from this kind of violence �� protecting the rights to life, and to live, move and think freely are essential tasks of government, but they are not ones to be achieved by any means and at the cost of such rights themselves.
�쏷hese laws trample on hard-won freedoms that we have long taken for granted. The UK could have been a beacon of progress here, but instead it is leading a race to the bottom. Governments should be providing security for people to enjoy their rights, rather than restricting people�셲 rights in the name of security.��
A Home Office spokesperson said: �쏷he current terror threat to the UK is severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. It is therefore vital that our counter-terrorism laws are effective, but also fair and proportionate.
�쏷he Investigatory Powers Act protects both our privacy and our security and was the result of three independent reports, all of which concluded a new law was needed. The act was passed with cross-party support and is the will of parliament.
�쏷he independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, found that the ability to collect data in bulk is a crucial tool used by the security and intelligence agencies to generate intelligence about threats that cannot be acquired by more targeted means. We will vigorously defend these vital powers that help to keep our families, communities and country safe.��
Despite last-minute appeals from the prime minister, and the return from overseas visits of both Gordon Brown and Jack Straw in order to vote, the government was defeated on the issue by 322 votes to 291, a larger than expected margin of 31.
A few minutes later, MPs voted for a rebel Labour amendment increasing the detention period to 28 days. That was passed by 323 votes to 290.
But the defeat on 90 days is a personal blow for Mr Blair, who strongly backed the police's demand for a three-month period.
According to parliament's division list, 49 Labour MPs rebelled against the government.
Mr Blair left the chamber shaking his head. He later told Sky News he would not be quitting and rejected accusations he was now "a lame duck".
He added: "People will believe parliament was deeply irresponsible."
The Conservative leader, Michael Howard, said the result left Mr Blair "seriously weakened" and called on him to "consider his position".
He added: "The prime minister has shown he no longer carries his party with him - and that is not good for the country."
Bookmakers William Hill shortened the odds on Mr Blair leaving office before the end of the year from 3-1 to 7-4 immediately after the vote.
MPs continued to vote on the remainder of the bill, which is less controversial. The bill may still face a stormy ride in the House of Lords, where there is no government majority.
Around the central lobby of Westminster, MPs were visibly digesting the shock of the government's first defeat.
Soon after the vote, the prime minister's official spokesman told reporters Mr Blair was "disappointed", but respected the will of parliament.
Asked whether the defeat reflected on Mr Blair's personal authority, the spokesman said: "This has been a one-off issue. It is an issue on which there has traditionally been a tension in parliament between those who, on the one hand, believe you have to do everything to protect the country's security, and, on the other hand, those who wish to protect civil liberties as they see it."
The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "I am delighted that we have shown Tony Blair that there are limits to what he can do."
"This is a victory for parliament and for Britain's freedoms."
The director of the civil liberties lobby group, Liberty, Shami Chakrabati, said she was "heartened" by the vote, but she warned it still doubled the existing permitted period for detention without charge. She also criticised the "overt political campaigning of senior police officers" for their part in lobbying MPs.
Earlier today, at prime minister's questions, Mr Blair told MPs to have a "sense of responsibility" and back the police's demand for a 90-day limit.
In heated exchanges between the prime minister and opposition leaders at question time, Mr Blair said it was his duty and "the duty of every member of this house" to support the police's request. In a 30-minute session dominated by the issue, one Tory backbencher shouted "police state" at Mr Blair.
Mr Howard said angrily: "We all want to fight terrorism effectively."
He argued that the government had failed to justify the need for 90-day detention and warned of riots, like those in France, if minority ethnic communities were alienated by the legislation.
Mr Blair reminded undecided Conservative MPs sitting behind Mr Howard that the "the police and those charged with fighting terrorism said the 90-day power was needed to make the country safe".
"You and your colleagues are going to have to make your decision today," he told Mr Howard.
"We have made ours. We believe this is right for our country. We believe it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism and I'm only sorry you don't agree."
With the government unsure of securing victory for the 90-day proposal later this afternoon, the cabinet ministers Mr Brown and Mr Straw were both ordered back from foreign visits by the chief whip to bolster the government's vote in the lobbies.
Labour loyalist Janet Anderson tabled a "fallback" amendment of 60 days, but Labour dissenter David Winnick also retabled his original proposal of 28 days - a period the Tories were prepared to accept.
Facing the possibility of the first defeat of his premiership, Mr Blair said he preferred to be right and lose than back down given the "compelling" case that the police had made to extend their powers of investigation.
"Sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing," he said.
Labour backbenchers made clear their concerns about the legislation a week ago, when the government's 66-seat majority was slashed to just one after 31 Labour MPs rebelled over another aspect of the bill. A rebel amendment to make an offence of "glorification" of terrorism carry "intent" was defeated.
1 We need to recognise that 'al-Qaeda' is an ideology, not an organisation. There is no point in talking about masterminds or hunting for a global headquarters. There are none.
2 We need to stop confusing justification with explanation. Learning what motivates enemies does not mean sympathising with them. Merely saying that the bombers are mad, when there is no evidence that militants are mentally ill or backward, and when contemporary radical Islam clearly has its roots in the conditions of the modern world, does not help.
3 We should ditch the rhetoric. There is no point in saying, 'We will never surrender to terrorism,' when history tells us that, in order to manage a terrorist threat, successive governments in the UK and abroad always mixed 'hard' coercive measures, such as those announced by Tony Blair last week, with a 'soft' political strategy that undercuts the legitimacy of the militants' claims. Representatives of the IRA are in our parliament. The Egyptians and Algerians ended their mass Islamic insurgencies of the early nineties with judicious concessions as well as repression. The Americans blithely admitted recently to talks with Iraqi insurgents.
4 We need to recognise that doing things that enrage millions, even if we feel that anger is wrong-headed and misdirected, will make us more of a target. Before the invasion of Iraq the UK was fairly low down the target list for the militants. Now, Britain has joined Israel and America at its top. It is impossible to speak with any credibility to young British Muslims - or any young Muslims - without admitting this.
5 The 7 July bombers were not 'brainwashed' by anyone. Radical Islam provided them with an explanation of what was happening in the world and suggested actions that made sense to them. So we need a broad range of measures to ensure that such ideologies are less likely to convince in the future. If we cannot negotiate with existing militants, we can at least stop the next wave of recruits.
Some causes of terrorism do exist within the UK. They include identity issues and the poor economic performance of many British Muslim communities as much as the activities of radical rabble-rousers from overseas. We need to accept that a harsher security environment will temporarily be necessary. Another major bombing in the UK could damage community relations beyond repair. We now know quite what a powerful weapon surveillance cameras are, whatever their civil liberties implications. Legal loopholes that mean men such as Abu Qatada, a key radical ideologue, cannot be expelled or detained should be closed. Most Islamic countries have a system of government-run colleges for Muslim clerics and licensing for such scholars and the UK needs one too to make sure that the lessons taught in mosques, religious schools and prisons are moderate.
But the real causes are international - and can be dealt with through real policies. Militants often cite Chechnya, Kashmir and Palestine as examples of western oppression of Muslims. In each case, complex historical, political and economic factors have combined to sustain conflict. But with sufficient will and attention, and a balanced, tough-minded approach, solutions are possible. Merely making an obvious effort to solve problems in a fair-minded way would be extremely helpful in restoring the goodwill many in the Islamic world once felt towards Britain.
6 We need to look for new allies in the Islamic world. We should be developing major programmes to develop civic society, with a particular emphasis on involving women, beyond the state. There are thousands of under-resourced groups involved in everything from literacy to human rights to micro-credit that can be assisted, with or without the consent of local governments, from the Maghreb to the Far East. They can help us to show the Islamic world that our way of life does not mean 'neo-imperialism' or 'moral corruption' but is about tolerance, justice and empowerment of the weak. They will help form a critical pro-Western, moderate and locally authentic bloc that in time will become a strong and important voice.
7 If the above seems intimidating, we must remember that small steps can make a huge difference. For instance, we need to sell ourselves better. The Foreign Office needs hundreds of Arabic and Urdu speakers to project our message. The government is determined to improve community relations in the UK, but needs to think globally. Every diplomatic mission should make convincing Muslims that the West is not an aggressor a priority.
None of these measures will end the threat of terrorism, but central to our efforts must remain a simple fact: violent Islamic militancy is not inevitable.
Counter-terrorism investigators have been investigating Khalid Masood�셲 life and associations across Britain as they raced to discover what led him to kill four people and injure more than 50 in Wednesday�셲 murderous attack in Westminster.
A joint investigation by Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command and MI5 led to new arrests on Thursday in London, Birmingham and Manchester with two people still in custody, while properties were searched in Wales and southern England.
Police want to discover if Masood, who was shot dead by armed police, was encouraged, supported or directed in the atrocity. The 52-year-old mowed down people in the heart of London then stabbed a police officer to death as he tried to burst into the Palace of Westminster.
The Guardian understands detectives are scouring large amounts of CCTV camera footage to see if there is any recording of Masood scouting the Westminster area before the attack.
They are also using camera records and automatic number plate recognition technology to see if they show his car in the area, when Masood could have been working out where the best place to run people over might have been and what weak points there were in Palace of Westminster security in the run-up to the attack. They will also repeat the same time-consuming lines of inquiry to see if a possible accomplice may have done the same.
Two minutes before the attack started at about 2.40pm on Wednesday, Masood used the WhatsApp communications app on his mobile phone, although it is not known why.
On Friday police named Masood�셲 fourth victim as 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes. Two people remained in a critical condition in hospital.
MI5 is urgently trying to discover how someone could come to believe in Islamic State�셲 violent ideology and hatch a murderous plot against high-profile targets to gain worldwide attention, all without the domestic security service having any idea it was coming.
Fresh details about Masood�셲 life have emerged. He had a 20-year history of offending that saw him jailed at least twice. He had converted to Islam more than a decade ago, and used several names during his life, having been born as Adrian Elms and brought up as Adrian Ajao before adopting a Muslim name.
So far, police believe he acted alone when he drove a hired car into civilians on Westminster Bridge before running into the grounds of parliament and stabbing a police officer to death. It emerged that on the eve of the attack he had checked into a Brighton hotel under his own name. The hotel manager said that Masood had been �쐋aughing and joking��.
Mark Rowley, Britain�셲 top counter-terrorism officer, said: �쏻hilst there is no evidence of further threats, you will understand our determination to find out if he either acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him.��
He described as �쐓ignificant�� two arrests made in Manchester and Birmingham.
Since the attack, police have arrested 11 people on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. On Friday they released eight without charge, having eliminated them from their inquiries, and one woman was released on Thursday on bail. The two in custody are a 58-year-old man and a man aged 27, both arrested on Thursday in Birmingham.
An address searched by police in Carmarthenshire, Wales, is believed to be a farmhouse, belonging to his mother.
With key questions unanswered about the man who inflicted the worst mass casualty terrorist attack on Britain in more than a decade, Rowley said investigators needed help from the public.
�쏻e remain keen to hear from anyone who knew Khalid Masood well; understands who his associates were; and can provide information about places he has recently visited,�� he said.
�쏷here might well be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but weren�셳 sure or didn�셳 feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing information to us.��
The man described by Isis propagandists as a �쐓oldier�� in their campaign of violence was born Adrian Elms, and the Guardian has established he grew up in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with two half-brothers.
But in 2000 he was jailed for grievous bodily harm after stabbing a man in the face following a row that was reported at the time to have had racial overtones. After being released from jail he attacked someone else and was imprisoned again.
Seventeen people are still being treated for their injuries in five London hospitals. Two of those are in critical condition, according to the Metropolitan police, with one person�셲 injuries considered life-threatening. One police officer struck on the bridge, 35-year-old PC Kris Aves, is feared to have suffered severe injuries.
More than 50 people, of at least 12 nationalities, were injured in Masood�셲 attack on Westminster Bridge. Of these, 31 initially required hospital treatment.
One woman rescued from the Thames, Andreea Cristea, 29, from Romania, was in London with her fiance, who had been planning to propose to her. Masood�셲 car struck her, throwing her into the river. She underwent an emergency operation for a blood clot on the brain.
Prince Charles visited some of the injured in hospital as police named the fourth dead victim of Masood�셲 attack. Rhodes, of south London, died in hospital overnight from his injuries sustained on Westminster Bridge. The others killed in the attack were PC Keith Palmer, 48, who was fatally stabbed by Masood inside the parliamentary gates; Kurt Cochran, 54, an American tourist, and Aysha Frade, 43, a London teacher. An internet fundraising appeal for Palmer�셲 family has raised more than 짙600,000.
Past terrorist attacks in Britain have led to debates about new laws or initiatives to counter the lure that violent jihad has for a small number of British based people.
Pent-up anger among law enforcement and government has spilled over, with Downing Street demanding social media companies do more to expunge extremist material from the internet. The prime minister�셲 spokesman said firms such as Facebook and Google �쐁an and must do more�� to remove inflammatory material from the web and that it was up to them to respond to public concern.
�쏶ocial media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated and we have been clear repeatedly that we think that they can and must do more,�� the spokesman told journalists.
�쏻e are always talking with them on how to achieve that. The ball is now in their court. We will see how they respond.��
In the aftermath of the attack, hundreds of people were rushed into Westminster Abbey, which was used as a sanctuary in case of further attacks. On Friday the archbishop of Canterbury and Muslim leaders were among those who joined an interfaith service to remember the victims of Masood.
The dead man, killed at Stockwell tube station on Friday after fleeing from armed police, was named as 27-year-old Jean Charles de Menezes. His body was identified by Alex Pereira, a cousin who lives in London and who afterwards told The Observer: 'I can't believe they shot him, because he was not a terrorist. He was an honest man.
'We [the family] are still too shocked to talk about it. But I am sure [that] he didn't do anything wrong. It was not right for the police to do that.'
Pereira said that the most upsetting part of identifying his cousin was 'to see bullet wounds in his back and his neck when I went to the mortuary in Greenwich.'
The Brazilian government last night voiced 'shock and surprise', saying it had always sought the 'eradication of the misery' of terror 'within international norms and respect for human rights'.
The statement added that Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, due in London on a previously scheduled visit for a UN reform conference, would be seeking a meeting with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw for 'clarifications about the death'.
Originally from a farm half an hour from the city of Gonzaga in Minas Gerais state in south-east Brazil, Menezes, who was unmarried, had been living in London for three years. He appears to have lived in a house in Scotia Road, Tulse Hill, south London, which had been under surveillance since the four failed bomb attacks on the city's tube and bus system last Thursday.
His grandmother, Dona Zilda, who lives on the farm, said early today: 'He was a lovely, educated young man, a worker. He would never be involved in terrorism.'
Scotland Yard said last night that Menezes 'was not connected to incidents in central London on 21 July in which four explosive devices were partly detonated. An inquest will be opened to acknowledge formal identification and adjourned, while awaiting the outcome of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.'
Soon after being followed from the Tulse Hill house by plainclothes officers watching the address, Menezes lay dead on the platform at Stockwell station from multiple gunshot wounds. He had failed to obey orders from armed officers to stop.
His death will cause controversy over the way Britain confronts suicide bombers, and has prompted calls for a public inquiry. In its first statement yesterday, the Metropolitan Police Service expressed 'regret' over his death.
'We are now satisfied that he was not connected with the incidents of Thursday, 21 July 2005,' it said. 'For somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the Metropolitan Police service regrets.'
Downing Street and Home Office sources last night declined to comment. But Ken Livingstone, London's Mayor, said the 'human tragedy' should be laid at the door of the terrorists.
'All Londoners will wish to offer their condolences to this man's family and friends,' he said. 'The police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public. This tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility.'
The Muslim Council of Great Britain warned last night that the 'terrible, tragic mistake' could have serious consequences. 'We got lots of hostile emails saying: "How dare you criticise the police?" - and now we hear that he is innocent,' said media secretary Inayat Bunglawala.
'We of course understand the police are under a great deal of pressure and it's a race against time to capture these four suspected bombers. But it is absolutely vital that their rules of engagement are very, very stringent and that this terrible mistake does not occur again.'
He said the police needed to encourage public confidence and co-operation from Muslims and others. 'For that co-operation to occur, the police also need to be seen to be making every possible endeavour to ensure they are going after the right people.'
The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which automatically examines fatal police firearms incidents, confirmed it was investigating.
Scotland Yard said last night that an unspecified number of officers had been taken off firearms duties, which is standard practice after a weapon has been discharged. The officers are still at work on normal duties.
Armed officers are instructed to shoot at the head, not the chest, when facing a suspected suicide bomber, to disable them faster. The change follows advice from the Israeli police.
Witnesses to Friday's shooting told of the terror on the man's face. Mark Whitby, a passenger who was sitting just yards away, said the man was 'hotly pursued' on to the train, adding: 'I looked at his face. He looked from left to right, but he basically looked like a cornered rabbit, like a cornered fox. He looked absolutely petrified ... It was a very, very distressing scene to watch, and to hear as well ... I saw them kill a man.'
Whitby last night told The Observer: 'The death of anyone, involved [in terrorism] or not, to me is abhorrent.'
Ken Jones, chief constable of Sussex and chair of the Association of Chief Police Officers' committee on terrorism and allied matters, appealed to the public yesterday to 'put themselves into the shoes' of officers. Dozens of firearms officers have been trained in confronting suicide bombers since 11 September and undercover officers regularly travel on trains. It is not a perfect science,' he said. 'I would ask the public to try to put themselves into the shoes of the officers, often young men and women, and understand how difficult these cases are.
'They have to be prepared to take a life knowing that if they fail to do so, the cost could be hundreds of lives. We have dreaded this day for years, but it is now an operational reality on the streets of Britain.' He said officers had to intervene at an earlier stage when facing 'people intent on mass murder'.
The address in Tulse Hill was identified from materials found inside the bombers' unexploded rucksacks on Thursday and was immediately put under surveillance. When Menezes, dressed in baseball cap, blue fleece and baggy trousers, emerged from it at around 10am on Friday, he was followed. When he headed for the nearby tube station, officers decided to arrest him. An armed unit took over, ordering him to stop. He did not. His unseasonally thick jacket apparently prompted concern that he had explosives strapped beneath.
Witnesses said the man jumped the ticket barriers and was chased into the station, where he half-tripped boarding a train. He was allegedly pushed to the floor by armed police, then, according to eyewitnesses, an officer fired five shots into his head.
Police quickly discovered he did not have a bomb, but it was not until yesterday that he was cleared of any involvement.
Officers are trained to look for 'precursor activities' indicating a suicide bomber about to detonate his explosive, thought to include a look of agitation combined with a sense of disconnection from the world. The Met said Menezes' 'clothing and behaviour' caused concerns.
Massoud Shadjareh, of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, also called for a public inquiry. 'How can you shoot someone on mere suspicion?' he asked. 'You can't even put someone in prison on suspicion.'
Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said yesterday said the shooting suggested that a 'shoot-to-kill' policy was in operation, and suggested it would increase the threat of further attacks. 'I cannot believe that this degree of violence is going to do anything but encourage more violence.'
Allegations of 'shoot-to-kill' policies are highly emotive following the scandal over tactics used by police in Northern Ireland.
Graham Brodie, a barrister who specialises in criminal law, said there should now be an investigation by another police force into whether criminal charges should be laid against any officer for murder or manslaughter. However, Brodie doubted that any officers would be prosecuted.
The police killing of a man mistakenly thought to be linked to the London terror attacks has prompted a huge political controversy, but legally rests on one crucial question: were police reasonably responding to what they saw as a threat to the public?
The incident, which the Metropolitan Police said yesterday was a 'tragedy' that it regretted, has automatically triggered a probe by the independent Police Complaints Commission and a coroner's inquest.
The leading human rights lawyer, Lord Lester, told The Observer that the issue of whether the police had acted properly was not one of human rights legislation, but would hinge instead on the specific facts of the case.
'The issue rests entirely on the facts - that is, of whether the police were reasonable in thinking that they were acting on a threat to themselves or the public.'
He noted that under existing legislation, police had always had the right to use force to confront such a threat.
He added that the reported change in rules of engagement to deal with the new threat of suspected suicide bombers, by shooting in the head instead of the chest or legs, would also be properly addressed as part of the inquiry.
The shooting at Stockwell Tube Station in south London is the latest in a number of incidents in recent years in which British police personnel's use of fatal force has been questioned in inquiries or the courts.
An inquest last year found a police marksman guilty of 'unlawful killing' when he shot a 46-year-old decorator from Hackney after mistaking a table leg the man was carrying for a gun. But this year, a High Court judge overturned the ruling, saying that there had been insufficient evidence to support the inquest verdict.
Shortly before leaving America for Britain, after 12 years as a correspondent, the relative of one of my son�셲 friends politely declined my invitation to visit us in London.
�쏧 don�셳 think I could go to Europe,�� she said. �쏧t doesn�셳 seem safe.��
Try as I might I could not suppress a laugh. My wife and children are African American. I am British. We were living in Chicago.
�쏷he odds of you being shot dead here are far greater than of you being killed in a terrorist attack over there.��
When the president uses his executive powers to ban more than 200 million people from entering America, ostensibly in the interests of security, and then, in the same week, the House of Representatives relaxes background checks for gun ownership, one is compelled to question the sense of proportionality when it comes to security. Whom do they intend to keep safe? By what means? And at what price to liberty?
Let us leave aside for the moment the fact that since 9/11 not a single American has been killed in a terrorist attack by a citizen from the countries on this list. The reality is that an American is at least twice as likely to be shot dead by a toddler than killed by a terrorist. In 2014 88 Americans were shot dead, on average, every day: 58 killed themselves while 30 were murdered. In that same year 18 Americans were killed by terrorist attacks in the US. Put more starkly: more Americans were killed by firearms roughly every five hours than were killed by terrorists in an entire year. It is unlikely that scrapping a rule requiring extended background checks for gun purchases by some social security recipients suffering from mental illness will improve the situation.
One need not downplay the importance of terrorism here. Terrorism is not only murderous. In its ability to spread anxiety and undermine democratic engagement with violence it is also deeply reactionary. Rather than galvanising people around a cause it divides them in the crudest manner possible �� on the basis of fear. That�셲 as true when America kills innocent civilians. But the fear most Americans experience daily isn�셳 imported �� it�셲 home grown. That�셲 true across the board, but particularly true for some minorities. Every day seven children and teens are shot dead in the US. Firearms are the biggest killer of young black people and the second biggest killer of all children, after traffic accidents. When the new US education secretary, Betsy DeVos, suggests schools might need guns to protect themselves from grizzly bears, she�셲 clearly not capable of gauging the real threat to American children.
While researching my book about all the young people who were killed on one random day �� 23 November 2013 �� every single parent of a black teenager who lost a child that day that I interviewed said they assumed this might happen to their kid. �쏧 didn�셳 think it would be him,�� said one mother. �쏧 thought it would be his brother.�� �쏽ou wouldn�셳 be doing your job as a father if you didn�셳,�� said another.
Doriane Miller is a primary-care physician who practises on Chicago�셲 South Side, where one teen was killed that day. Dr Miller noticed a significant number of young black patients arriving with psychosomatic symptoms �� many also had tattoos bearing the names and dates of loved ones who had been lost to gun violence. When she tried to talk to them about it they shut down.
�쏷here was that sense that this is the way it is in my life and in my community,�� she said. �쏷here is a learned hopelessness around this. And so you suck it up, you man up, and you move on.��
Many of the areas where these young people live, and die, look like war zones �� empty lots, half-demolished houses, depleted infrastructure, militarised policing, potholed roads, boarded-up houses, abandoned churches. But more importantly, they are experienced as such. People (mostly young men) disappear �� either to prison or to the grave �� leaving a huge gender imbalance. Times are hard, and the informal economy is rife, meaning there are spivs everywhere making an ostentatious display of their wealth. The one major difference is that whereas wars often cement communities as people band together against a �쐁ommon enemy,�� in these areas the enemy is everywhere and, potentially, anyone.
These, too, are Americans. They too deserve security. Indeed it is a nonsense to talk about securing the borders from the outside world if many of those who live within those selfsame borders continue to live in a state of constant fear.
Many of those who insist that, when it comes to terror, one must balance individual rights against collective security, become curiously silent when it comes to adapting their interpretation of the right to bear arms to the issue of public safety.
In 2002 I interviewed the late Maya Angelou about her views on the 9/11 terror attacks. �쏬iving in a state of terror was new to many white people in America,�� she told me. �쏝ut black people have been living in a state of terror in this country for more than 400 years.��
If the current administration applied just half the zeal to making sure all people in the country feel included and safe as they do to making sure some outside of it feel excluded and anxious, the impact on Americans�� sense of security would be repaid exponentially.
After a judge blocked the Muslim ban over the weekend Trump said that if there was another terrorist attack America should blame him. Between me writing this article and you reading it the chances are another child will be shot dead. Whom, I wonder, should we blame for that?

Syria suffered its worst terrorist attack since the start of the uprising when 55 people were reported killed and nearly 400 injured in twin car bomb blasts near a government intelligence building in Damascus.
Syrian officials and media blamed foreign-backed terrorist groups for the attack on Thursday, saying it was carried out "in the service of the interests of Israel and its allies in the region". Russia hinted that other unnamed countries were involved.
The opposition accused the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the bombings to smear them as terrorists supported by foreign governments.
The death toll was the biggest in Damascus since the start of the uprising in March 2011. It was sophisticated and carefully co-ordinated. Witnesses said the first blast, at rush hour peak, was quickly followed by a second, larger one, maximising casualties, damage and terror. Most of the victims were reported to be civilians.
"Two booby-trapped cars loaded with more than 1,000kg of explosives and driven by suicide bombers carried out the terrorist blasts," said a statement by the interior ministry. The explosions left two large craters.
Syrian state TV showed bodies lying in the street amid smouldering vehicles. The official health ministry tally of the dead and 372 injured included a reference to "15 bags of body parts".
On Thursday night, it was reported that Syria's UN ambassador said there had also been an explosion in Aleppo. Bashar Ja'afari said the explosion on Thursday morning in Syria's second city "led also to �� civilian victims and massive damages to private property". He gave no further details.
Experts compared the Damascus attacks to those on Iraqi government ministries in 2009, which were blamed by the authorities in Baghdad on groups based in Syria.
Thursday's blasts were condemned internationally. Kofi Annan, the special envoy for the UN and Arab League, said it was vital to implement his six-point plan for peace in Syria. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, said the bombings "remind us of the urgent need for a political solution in Syria before it is too late". The UN security council condemned the attacks.
The foreign secretary, William Hague, also condemned the blasts, adding: "Yet again it is the people of Syria who are suffering as a result of the repression and violence, which must come to an end."
Russia, a close ally of Assad, accused unspecified foreign countries of being behind the bombings. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have both called for the arming of anti-Assad rebels, and Gulf money is helping the Syrian opposition. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in Beijing: "Some of our foreign partners are doing practical things so that the situation in Syria explodes in a literal and figurative sense."
The question of who was behind the latest grim scenes of craters, blast-damaged buildings, burned-out vehicles, charred and mutilated corpses and body parts was being asked before the smoke had cleared in the al-Qazaz area, a busy intersection on the ring road in southern Damascus.
Haitham Maleh and Bassam Ja'ara, leading opposition spokesmen, blamed the regime and claimed it was reacting to earlier criticism from Annan about the failure to implement his plan. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), the main armed wing of the opposition, insisted it was observing a ceasefire under the terms of the Annan plan.
Syria's divided opposition has repeatedly accused the government of organising bombings to smear its enemies as terrorists and to deflect attention from the peaceful origins of the uprising and continuing popular support for it �� though it does now include a significant armed element. Jabhat al-Nusra, a little known jihadi organisation, has claimed responsibility for previous bombings in Damascus, Hama and Aleppo.
Analysts note that Syria's intelligence services have a track record of dirty tricks, including assassinations and bombings in Lebanon and Iraq, and of manipulating Islamist groups for their own purposes.
One angry supporter of the regime described the bombings as the work of "Nato-backed FSA terrorists". Syrian TV showed a man pointing to the debris and saying: "Is this freedom? This is the work of the Saudis."
The opposition Revolution Leadership Council of Damascus reported security forces had shot and killed a 24-year-old man who was watching the scene of the explosion from his roof. It said mobile phone lines were cut off at the time of the blast and claimed that some bodies had no blood on them, suggesting they might have been brought to the scene by the regime.
It is possible that the escalation in violence may slow the already sluggish deployment of UN observers charged with monitoring implementation of the Annan plan: only 70 of a planned 300 are in the country.
Opinions are still divided about two attacks on similarly sensitive security installations in the Kafr Sousseh area of Damascus before Christmas. Opposition sources described mysterious transfers of prisoners to the heavily guarded buildings the day before the blasts, which coincided with the arrival of Arab League monitors. Western governments concluded that those attacks had been carried out by an al-Qaida-type group using military explosives and methods perfected in Iraq.
The next attack, a suicide bombing on 6 January in the nearby suburb of Meidan, was widely believed to have been staged by the Syrian authorities.
Film inadvertently broadcast on state media showed apparently dead or injured people moving around after being filmed, and objects such as shopping bags being placed at the scene by security personnel. State media arrived surprisingly quickly, adding to suspicions that it was an elaborate fake. Opposition sources claimed that names on the casualty lists in these incidents have been duplicated.
Met officers, Coastguard, fire brigade and ambulance service practice their response in case of a terrorist attack on a River Thames sightseeing cruise boat close to the London Docklands area on Sunday. In the first drill of its kind on the river, Metropolitan police say that the training exercise is aimed at testing the effectiveness of emergency rescue tactics in lifelike conditions
Searches are being carried out at a mansion flat in central London after a man with suspected links to al-Qaida allegedly tried to blow up a transatlantic plane, Scotland Yard said today.
The man, a 23-year-old student from Nigeria named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, is to be charged in a US court on Saturday, officials said.
Mutallab tried to ignite a device as the Northwest Airlines flight prepared to land in Detroit. It is understood he is an engineering student at University College London.
He was overpowered by passengers and crew members, who smelled smoke and heard what sounded like firecrackers, federal officials said.
Security has been stepped up at UK airports for passengers flying to the US, the Department for Transport said.
Gordon Brown said the UK would take "whatever action was necessary" to protect passengers.
UK airport operator BAA said searches on flights to the US would increase.
A statement on the British Airways website said Washington had revised its security arrangements for all travellers to the US and they would only be allowed one piece of hand luggage.
The prime minister said he had been contact with Sir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, because of the "serious potential threat".
He said: "The security of the public must always be our primary concern. We have been working closely with the US authorities investigating this incident since it happened."
One official said the man claimed to have been instructed by al-Qaida to detonate the plane over US soil.
A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said: "We are in liaison with the US authorities. Searches are being carried out at addresses in central London."
It is understood from security sources that police and MI5 will want to find out "as a matter of priority" the significance of any time that he spent in the UK. The address being searched is in Mansfield Street, near Harley Street.
It is believed that extra staff and resources have been assigned to the investigation as a matter of urgency, and a key priority will be to check whether the arrested man has appeared in any other investigations.
University College London said in a statement: "UCL can confirm that a student by the name of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was enrolled on a mechanical engineering course at the institution between September 2005 and June 2008.
"However, it must be stressed that the university has no evidence that this is the same person currently being referred to in the media."
Flight 253 with 278 passengers and 11 crew members aboard was about 20 minutes from landing when passengers heard popping noises, witnesses said.
At least one person climbed over others and jumped on the man. Shortly afterwards, the arrested man was taken to the front of the plane with his trousers cut off and his legs burned, a passenger said. Police said the burns indicated the explosive had been strapped to his legs.
President Barack Obama, who is on holiday in Hawaii, has been informed of the situation and is monitoring events.
One US intelligence official said the explosive device was a mix of powder and liquid. It failed when the passenger tried to detonate it.
"It sounded like a firecracker in a pillowcase," said Peter Smith, a traveller from the Netherlands. "First there was a pop, and then [there] was smoke."
Smith said a passenger sitting opposite the man climbed over people, crossed the aisle and tried to restrain the man. Syed Jafri, another passenger, said he saw a glow and smelled smoke. Then, he said, "a young man behind me jumped on him."
"Next thing you know, there was a lot of panic," said Jafri. The White House said it believed it was attempted terrorist act, and stricter security measures were quickly imposed on airline travel. It did not specify what they were. The incident has echoes of the British "shoe bomber" Richard Reid, who tried to destroy a transatlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes, but was subdued by other passengers. Reid is serving a life sentence.
Mutallab was being questioned last night. An intelligence official said he was being held and treated in a hospital. Flight 253 began in Nigeria and went through Amsterdam en route to Detroit.
In the UK, a Department for Transport spokeswoman said: "In response to events in Detroit, the US authorities have requested additional measures for US-bound flights.
"We are monitoring the situation and will make any assessments as necessary as this develops."
Although general airport security remains the same, with no change to luggage and liquid restrictions, passengers travelling to the US can expect more searches at the gate before boarding.
Airport operator BAA said in a statement: "Passengers travelling to the United States should expect their airline to carry out additional security checks prior to boarding.
"To support this important process, which will take time, we would advise passengers to leave more time to check in and limit the amount of baggage being taken on board the aircraft. If in any doubt, please contact the relevant airline for further information."
A police spokeswoman at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam declined to comment about security procedures at the airport. Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest aiports with many transit passengers from Africa and Asia to North America, strictly enforces European security regulations including only allowing small amounts of liquid in hand luggage that must be placed inside clear plastic bags.
There was nothing out of the ordinary about the flight until it was on final approach to Detroit, said federal aviation administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory. That is when the pilot declared an emergency, she said. According to the airline, owned by Delta, eight flight attendants and three pilots were on board.
The FBI and the homeland security department issued an intelligence note on 20 November about the potential threat for the holiday season.
At the time, officials said they had no specific information about plans for an attack by al-Qaida or other terrorist groups.
In 2003, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden posted a recording on the internet calling on Muslims in oil-rich Nigeria to rise up against one of the "regimes who are slaves of America".
But links to al-Qaida remained rare, though security forces claimed to break up a linked terror cell in November 2007.
Security at Nigeria's two major international airports in the capital,
Abuja, and Lagos remain a point of concern. Uniformed police officers are often kept busy keeping hagglers and taxi drivers out of the airport. Bags quickly pass through x-ray scanners and those watching incoming passengers don't usually conduct tests for explosive residue on passengers' hand luggage or shoes.
At the gate, airline workers often check passengers again with handheld metal detectors.
The danger with literary thrillers is that their elevated prose writes cheques their stock plots and characters can't cash �� or is it the other way round? Fans of Cormac McCarthy's macho-poetic high style will feel instantly at home with this confident but oddly unsatisfying debut. The Terror of Living gives us horses and guns; rugged loners saved from themselves by loyal wives; and a folksy Big Theme, essentially "good people sometimes do bad things". (In case you miss it en route, a character spells it out at the end: "The way I see it, you're both good people, it's just bad things that happen.") It also gives us a taut cat-and-mouse plot the set-up of which owes enough to McCarthy's No Country for Old Men for the whole thing to play as homage, if that's how you want it to play.
Phil Hunt is an ex-con in his late 50s who runs a horse ranch with his wife, Nora, supplementing his meagre income by drug-running up in the mountains between Canada and Washington state. He's been doing this for 20 years and has grown used to its easy perks. Which is why he's so surprised when, one night, it all goes wrong. The helicopter drops its brick of cocaine, but watching through binoculars is Deputy Sheriff Bobby Drake, who is hunting in the mountains and whose father is in jail for precisely Hunt's crime. A chase ensues. Hunt's sidekick, referred to as "the kid" �� a nod to Blood Meridian? �� is captured and will later die horribly, not to say rather implausibly, in a holding cell.
Drake and his wife, Sheri, are moved into a hotel in Seattle for their protection and so that he can work more closely with the DEA �� a process not without embarrassment, given his family history. Hunt, however, escapes and goes on the lam, pursued by both the police and the hitman the smugglers have sent after him: an albino-blond psychopath called Grady, who carries a set of knives around with him and cackles demonically. Grady is pure genre gristle, a very different beast to the mythic Chigurh, his broad equivalent in No Country for Old Men. He's the bogeyman-in-chief, the noose tightening around Hunt's neck, the bad person doing bad things who, just by existing, is supposed to underline the trivial nature of Hunt's offence. In a novel concerned, in the now-dominant American book-club manner, to show characters sympathetically, Grady is the one person we're permitted to dislike, though he earns this status only after he's turned the book's final third into a shambles of severed limbs and blood-slippery floors.
Waite is an impressive writer with a lean, muscular style reminiscent of his obvious heroes �� McCarthy, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Stone. The sequence in which Hunt and the Vietnamese drug mule he's traded his cocaine for are pursued by Grady in a boat is truly thrilling, and there are lovely oblique details such as the young Hunt, when in prison for killing a man during a botched robbery, becoming obsessed with the postmarks of letters he's received: "He liked to know where something had been. He liked to see that it had a location and a date and that it had travelled that long distance to him."
And yet The Terror of Living doesn't quite gel. It's trapped between genres in a way that feels craven and emollient rather than inspired and energising. You can't blame Waite for wanting to have his cake and eat it �� to produce a book that entertains on a fairly basic level and shows what he can do as a stylist. But Grady is just silly.
If Islamic State did bring down a packed passenger jet over the Sinai desert, as many US and UK officials believe is a �쐓ignificant possibility��, then the act would mark a significant escalation of the group�셲 capabilities and strategic aims, but also underline its continuing regional �� rather than global �� focus.
One of the key differences between Isis and al-Qaida is that the former has focused its energies almost exclusively on seizing and holding territory. Al-Qaida, the veteran terrorist organisation from which Isis broke away, still, theoretically at least, prioritises spectacular strikes on targets in the west.
Al-Qaida has a long track record of targeting planes. This goes back to 1995 and a plot to bring down half a dozen airliners over the Pacific. Then came the 9/11 attacks, a 2002 attempt to bring down an Israeli airliner with a surface to air missile, a hugely ambitious plot in 2006 targeting transatlantic planes, and several more recent attempts by the Yemen-based affiliate, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, to strike at western air traffic.
Isis has avoided such operations. One reason is that social media and digital technologies mean it no longer needs a spectacular attack killing large numbers of westerners to gain publicity, as was the case when professional news editors or repressive states decided what was broadcast and what was not.
A video of an execution is easily disseminated and provokes shock, horror �� and a political reaction �� across the globe with only a fraction of the resources of a bigger, mass-casualty strike in the west. A small team of lightly armed gunmen at a hotel or museum in a city somewhere on the Mediterranean shoreline and patronised by Europeans will also gain major publicity.
So far, Isis has limited itself to calling on individuals in the west to strike targets where they live, rather than directly controlling or commissioning complex attacks anywhere outside the Islamic world. The focus of 99% of the group�셲 attention has been on its key strategic objectives: slowly but steadily expanding its base in Iraq and Syria, with an accompanying interest in building a network of affiliates.
An attack on Russian passengers in a plane would thus be an escalation, and Isis claims of responsibility for the attack last weekend, though vague, make it clear that Moscow has been added to the members of the �쐁rusader-Zionist alliance�� that militants of all stripes believe is dedicated to humiliating, dividing and subordinating Muslims.
Yet the destruction of the Airbus A321M remains nonetheless within a local context, rather than a global one. The Russians are a target because of their armed intervention in the Syrian civil war from a month ago, not because of their actions outside this theatre. The prime suspects behind the tragedy, if it does prove to be a terrorist attack, are local Isis supporters in the Sinai, according to reports of the thinking of US and UK officials. The location of the strike is within the core zone of territory of most interest to Isis.
If it was indeed an Isis bomb that brought down the plane �� and both Egypt and Russia have downplayed any suggestion that the crash is linked to terrorism �� then this still does not signal that the group has launched a fully fledged global campaign of violence. Yet.
France has introduced sea patrols for passenger ferries to and from Britain, after a string of jihadi attacks in recent months that have shaken the country, a marine police spokesman said.
�쏛 permanent unit has been deployed for passenger ferries since August 1,�� Lieut Pierre-Joachim Antona told AFP.
�쏷he marine gendarmes will carry out patrols, which will be random but regular, with the aim of securing these vessels against the terrorist threat,�� he added.
Marine police deployed all along the French coastline �� from the North Sea to the Mediterranean �� have been tasked with contributing to efforts that began last year to secure the country�셲 waters, in cooperation with land forces, the spokesman said.
The first such patrol took place on Monday, with French officers flown in by helicopter on to the Mont Saint-Michel ferry, just as it entered French waters from southern England at about 5pm local time (1500 GMT), and remained on board until the vessel reached its final destination in the northwestern French town of Caen.
Antona said the armed patrols would be similar to those in train stations across France, whose high visibility helps dissuade potential attackers from striking.
France and Britain are in talks about expanding the patrols�� mandate beyond the limits of French territorial waters. Should an agreement be reached, French officers could be on board ferries from port to port.
British holidaymakers last week spent hours sweating in their cars as 15-hour queues snaked back from the port of Dover due to heightened entry checks by French border police.
�� This article was amended on 3 August 2016. An earlier version of the headline said incorrectly that French armed guards were being deployed on British ferries. They are being used on French ferries.
Donald Trump�셲 comments during a rally in Florida on Saturday night that seemed to suggest a non-existent terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden have pitted the Scandinavian nation against some fervent supporters of the US president.
Defending his plans to ban refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump told a crowd in Melbourne: �쏽ou look at what�셲 happening in Germany, you look at what�셲 happening last night in Sweden.�� No terrorist attack or major crime took place in Sweden on Friday night.
While the Swedes are still scratching their heads over Trump�셲 comments, and the former prime minister Carl Bildt wonders on Twitter what the president had been smoking, some Trump supporters believe the media is �쐇ntent on covering up what migrants have done to Sweden��.
Trump on Sunday clarified his comments, saying they related to �쐇mmigrants & Sweden�� and were based on a Fox News report.
However, there is little evidence that the nation is suffering under a migrant-led crime wave. In fact, the most pressing issue in Sweden at the moment is apparently who will become the nation�셲 Eurovision entrant.
Margot Wallstr철m, the Swedish foreign minister, tweeted an extract of the country�셲 foreign policy declaration for 2017 which talks about Oxford Dictionaries declaring the term �쐏ost-truth�� its international word of the year.
The Swedes were not alone in their confusion and bemusement - Twitter spawned the hashtags #IStandWithSweden and #jesuisIKEA.
Others, including the Swedish embassy in Washington, wondered if the US president should look elsewhere for his information on the state of foreign nations.
Erik Modenese scans the half-filled terraces of the bars, cafes and restaurants lining rue Montorgueil in central Paris, and ruminates that nearly seven weeks after the deadly 13 November terror attacks, business �� and life �� has yet to return to normal.
�쏻e�셱e all still around 10% lower than usual despite the magnificent spring-like weather. New Year�셲 Eve activity will be down too,�� says Modenese, manager of the Le Compas restaurant-bar north of les Halles which, like other Parisian bars and clubs, saw business slump by nearly half following the attacks.
�쏱arisians are finally starting to go out again, but the tourists still aren�셳 back in big numbers,�� he says. �쏷he attacks are still having an impact.��
Less than two months after coordinated terror strikes on popular nightlife spots in and around the French capital left 130 people dead and hundreds injured, concerns about renewed violence still influence the activities of residents, tourists and officials. Heightened security measures are also changing the look and atmosphere of daily life.
Thousands of military and police reinforcements have been deployed across the city and country, with patrolling soldiers in purple berets, matching khaki uniforms and flak vests, automatic weapons gripped to their chests now a common sight. On Christmas Eve alone, 120,000 security forces guarded churches and public venues across France. Paris police authorities say 9,000 officers �� more than 80% of the area�셲 total force �� will be deployed across the capital on 31 December.
Terror fears are also dampening the run-up to Paris�셲 New Year�셲 Eve festivities �� traditionally a high point on the city�셲 tourism calendar. This year, Paris�셲 official celebrations are being scaled back, with authorities expecting fewer French and foreign visitors at year-end events that frequently draw more than 600,000 revellers to the Champs Elys챕es.
Initially torn about whether to cancel festivities altogether, the Paris authorities instead decided to tone them down with security concerns in mind. The customary fireworks show, for example, will be replaced by a video displayed on the Arc de Triomphe, and access to the Champs Elys챕es will be closed after 8pm to restrict crowds.
In announcing the modified new year agenda, Paris�셲 mayor, Anne Hidalgo, acknowledged �쐔he event will be above all symbolic�� amid enduring terror fears, aiming instead �쏿t sending out a message to the whole world �� Paris is standing and the Parisians continue to live��.
But symbolism alone won�셳 bring relief to suffering businesses that depend on Parisians living, socialising and celebrating in quasi-public venues.
�쏧t will be a disappointing new year, especially for bars and cafes relying heavily on tourists, and popular neighbourhood hangouts such as those targeted in the attacks,�� says Alexandre Bernard, manager of the Caf챕 P챔re et Fils on the rue Montmartre near the Paris Bourse �� whose own 50% drop in business following the attacks has been reversed amid daytime custom from surrounding office buildings.
Generally, Bernard says, �쏷his will be a hard year for the sector �� and it may only be the start if extremists keep the terror pressure high into 2016.��
Travel research company ForwardKeys said in a 24 November report that future airline bookings to Paris, which plunged after the strikes, are still 27% lower than last year. Industry organisations also estimate hotel room reservations in the city have recovered only half of their 30% post-attack slide.
The CSCAD union representing Paris nightclub, theatre, restaurant and bar owners says activity remains up to 40% lower than in the last two months of 2014, with tourist revenues down 60-80%. Those declines are even more damaging, the CSCAS says, because of affected businesses also being forced to boost security spending.
American tourists Geoffrey Hughes and Blaire Andres say they have encountered extra security measures at places such as the Louvre and Pompidou Centre that offset any time saved in navigating thinner Paris crowds.
Andres, 26 �� who like Hughes lives in London �� says the sight of police patrolling with automatic weapons at the ready �쐁an actually be more unsettling than reassuring if you aren�셳 used to seeing that in public��.
But both add they never seriously considered altering their plans to visit Paris after the November attacks, and suspect people are misreading the current terror threat and French responses to it.
�쏷hat�셲 sort of �쁫ightning striking twice in the same spot�� logic,�� says Hughes, 31, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics. �쏷here�셲 probably no time safer to come here than now.��
The prosecution of a Swedish national accused of terrorist activities in Syria has collapsed at the Old Bailey after it became clear Britain�셲 security and intelligence agencies would have been deeply embarrassed had a trial gone ahead, the Guardian can reveal.
His lawyers argued that British intelligence agencies were supporting the same Syrian opposition groups as he was, and were party to a secret operation providing weapons and non-lethal help to the groups, including the Free Syrian Army.
Bherlin Gildo, 37, who was arrested last October on his way from Copenhagen to Manila, was accused of attending a terrorist training camp and receiving weapons training between 31 August 2012 and 1 March 2013 as well as possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist.
Riel Karmy-Jones, for the crown, told the court on Monday that after reviewing the evidence it was decided there was no longer a reasonable prospect of a prosecution. �쏮any matters were raised we did not know at the outset,�� she told the recorder of London, Nicholas Hilliard QC, who lifted all reporting restrictions and entered not guilty verdicts.
In earlier court hearings, Gildo�셲 defence lawyers argued he was helping the same rebel groups the British government was aiding before the emergence of the extreme Islamist group, Isis. His trial would have been an �쏿ffront to justice��, his lawyers said.
Henry Blaxland QC, the defence counsel, said: �쏧f it is the case that HM government was actively involved in supporting armed resistance to the Assad regime at a time when the defendant was present in Syria and himself participating in such resistance it would be unconscionable to allow the prosecution to continue.��
Blaxland told the court: �쏧f government agencies, of which the prosecution is a part, are themselves involved in the use of force, in whatever way, it is our submission that would be an affront to justice to allow the prosecution to continue.��
After Monday�셲 hearing, Gildo�셲 solicitor, Gareth Peirce, said his case had exposed a number of �쐁ontradictions�� �� not least that the matters on which he was charged were not offences in Sweden, and that the UK government had expressed support for the Syrian opposition.
�쏦e has been detained in this country although he did not ever intend to enter this country. For him it�셲 as if he has been abducted by aliens from outer space,�� she said.
�쏥iven that there is a reasonable basis for believing that the British were themselves involved in the supply of arms, if that�셲 so, it would be an utter hypocrisy to prosecute someone who has been involved in the armed resistance.��
Gildo�셲 defence lawyers quoted a number of press articles referring to the supply of arms to Syrian rebels, including one from the Guardian on 8 March 2013, on the west�셲 training of Syrian rebels in Jordan. Articles on the New York Times from 24 March and 21 June 2013, gave further details and an article in the London Review of Books from 14 April 12014, implicated MI6 in a �쐒at line�� for the transfer of arms from Libya.
Gildo was was flying to Manila to join his wife, a Filipina, when he was stopped under schedule 7 of the 2000 Terrorism Act, the same statute used to question David Miranda, partner of the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, in 2013.
The court heard that Gildo had sought the help of the Swedish secret service, Sapo, when he wanted to return to his home country.
It is not the first time a British prosecution relating to allegations of Syrian terrorism has collapsed. Last October Moazzem Begg was released after �쐍ew material�� was said to have emerged.
The attorney general was consulted about Monday�셲 decision. Karmy-Jones told the court in pre-trial hearings that Gildo had worked with Jabhat al-Nusra, a �쐏roscribed group considered to be al-Qaida in Syria��. He was photographed standing over dead bodies with his finger pointing to the sky.

A fake terrorist attack has panicked guests at the H척tel du Cap, the five-star luxury hotel frequented by celebrity guests during the Cannes film festival.
The �쁝ttack��, which was in fact a stunt by a French internet company, happened yesterday, Friday the 13th. Six men in matching helmets and military-style utility vests approached the hotel�셲 dock via boat, before one of them began marching up the steps towards frightened guests, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
�쏻e were all caught off guard,�� said publicist JR Savet, who was eating with friends on the du Cap�셲 terrace. �쏛nd then someone screamed and people jumped out of their chairs and started moving quickly to the swimming pool area. It was pretty scary.��
Savet said that he was shocked by the fact that the men seemed to be dressed as an �쏧sis-like�� militia group.
Organisers at the Cannes film festival have called in 500 additional security personnel this year as the threat of an attack by ISIS is, following the attacks on Paris and Brussels, heightened.
Last month French security forces staged a mock attack on the film festival�셲 principal venue, the Palais. �쏷errorists�� wielding automatic weapons fired blanks at police, before climbing over the �쐗ounded�� (volunteers wearing red bibs) and storming the steps of the conference centre.
The du Cap, which sits eight miles east along the Cote d�섲zur coast from Cannes, regularly hosts some of the movie industry�셲 most famous figures during the film festival. On its way to the hotel, the boat reportedly sped past yachts owned by Steven Spielberg and Roman Abramovitch.
Cannes police are investigating the stunt, which a du Cap spokesperson has called �쏿 bad joke �� a really bad one��.
The ABC has admitted it was an oversight not to correct a misleading question on Q&A about mayor of London Sadiq Khan�셲 response to the attack on Westminster last week.
The first question asked on the popular Monday night program was: �쏧n the wake of the London terror attack in Westminster, the mayor of London, Mr Sadiq Khan, stated that terror attacks are now �쁯art and parcel�� of living in a big city, expressing a need to be vigilant.
�쏶ydney is a booming metropolitan capital, with a population of 5 million Australians with diverse backgrounds and cultures. Is Mr Khan right? And do Sydneysiders and residents of other major Australian cities need to accept terrorism as an inevitable part of modern life?��
But, as many viewers remarked on the program�셲 Facebook page, Khan actually said being prepared for the threat of terror attacks was part and parcel of living in a big city and he said it six months earlier about another incident, not the London attack.
What Khan actually said in September was: �쏱art and parcel of living in a great global city is you�셶e got to be prepared for these things, you�셶e got to be vigilant, you�셶e got to support the police doing an incredibly hard job. We must never accept terrorists being successful, we must never accept that terrorists can destroy our life or destroy the way we lead our lives.��
The question from audience member Eliza appeared to be based on misinformation in a tweet by Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of the US president, sent in the hours after the attack in London on the Houses of Parliament which left four dead, including a police officer.
Trump Jr was heavily criticised for misrepresenting Khan by linking to a September 2016 story in the Independent, which quoted Khan in the wake of a bombing in New York.
�쏽ou have to be kidding me?!�� Trump Jr tweeted, quoting the headline: �쏷error attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan��.
Panelist Peter Holmes a Court corrected the questioner�셲 statement about Khan: �쏦e didn�셳 say that, right? First thing is to get over the messages that get out so quickly. He said that in New York, September 20 last year when the bomb went off on 23rd Street, what he was saying is we have to be prepared for terror all the time.��
Some viewers said Q&A was guilty of reporting �쐄ake news��.
�쏧t�셲 worth noting that he didn�셳 say that after the Westminster attack, he said it in September last year after the bomb explosion in New York,�� one viewer said. �쏧 still disagree with him, but there�셲 no use being dishonest, whether intentional or unintentional.��
Another viewer said: �쏷he London mayor did not say it post this incident, but rather about a year ago. As well, he said it in completely different context.��
A spokeswoman for Q&A said it was an oversight.
�쏛s a general rule we try to ensure audience members questions make sense, without changing them more than we have to, however not correcting the issue of timing in this question was an oversight,�� she told Guardian Australia. �쏷his was quickly addressed in the discussion that followed. The substance of the question was unaffected, and it was a valid question to put.��
The string of terror attacks in Europe and further afield since last summer has sent reverberations through the travel industry, but Thomas Cook, arguably Britain�셲 best known tour operator, has felt the effects more than most.
Its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has warned the industry is suffering the worst disruption in his 30-year career.
The company�셲 shares lost almost a fifth of their value this month when it revealed falling bookings as passengers steered clear of trouble spots.
That warning coincided with the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight on its way from Paris to Cairo, renewing concerns that consumers would be reluctant to travel. The plane was later found to have crashed into the sea, killing all 66혻people on board, though the cause has not yet been established.
Thomas Cook�셲 previous trading update, in March, came on the same day terrorists attacked Brussels airport. It followed the murder of 130 people in Paris in November, the killing of 38혻holidaymakers in Tunisia in June and the October bombing of a Russian plane flying from Egypt that killed 224 people.
The first three months of this year have seen a series of attacks in Turkey, which 2.5 million Britons visit each year. Thomas Cook�셲 second-biggest market is Turkey, but visitor numbers tumbled 28% in April �� the biggest fall in 17 years.
To add to the pressure on holiday companies, the UK economy has been slowing, consumer confidence is shaky and wage growth weak, while next month�셲 referendum on EU membership has helped push down the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.
Ryanair and easyJet, Europe�셲 biggest carriers, were forced to cut prices after the Paris attacks and both have said seats will be cheaper than last year over the holiday season. Ryanair boss Michael O�셂eary spoke of a price war, characteristically declaring his company would be the inevitable winner because of its size and aggressive pricing.
Yet despite all the doom-laden talk, total UK bookings for package holidays this summer are up 6% from a year ago, according to GfK, which compiles a weekly survey of agents and operators.
Britons�� commitment to their annual break survived the Great Recession and it appears to remain a top priority. Early bookings for winter and next summer are up 22% and 18% respectively.
Acting on Foreign Office advice, tour operators are not flying to Tunisia or the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which has been reduced to little more than a ghost town, helping send overall bookings to the country down by almost two thirds. The government advises people to be wary when travelling to Turkey, where bookings are down by a third.
There has been a surge away from these perceived danger spots to the familiarity of the western Mediterranean, which Britons first started jetting to in the late 1960s.
Bookings for Spain are up 27% this year, with Portugal up 30% and Italy up 12% over last year. Greece is coming out of the doldrums: business is up 4% following a huge rise last year. Thomas Cook has moved the bookings of 1.2 million customers who had arranged holidays in Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt to these countries and to long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the US and Cuba.
There has been a corresponding effect on prices in Europe. Last month it cost about 짙170 less per person to book two weeks in Turkey compared with last year, but the equivalent trip to Portugal is 짙94 more expensive and rising.
David Hope, GfK�셲 business group director, says: �쏱rices are going up and up and up.�� But he says this is only healthy for tour operators if they can provide enough rooms to meet demand.
�쏧t�셲 looking quite healthy at the moment but the concern is that if the likes of Spain and Portugal become booked up, will they have stock left that people want to buy?�� he says. �쏻hat is left will be lower-grade property they can get in Spain or hotels in Turkey �� and do people want to go there?��
Thomas Cook�셲 rival, Tui, which owns Thomson, has fared better because it is bigger in Spain and relies less on Turkey. It has also gone upmarket by operating its own boutique-style hotels �� a model Thomas Cook is trying to copy.
Wyn Ellis, an analyst at the City broker Numis, says: �쏷hat seems to be a more resilient part of the market, partly because it tends to book earlier. At the commodity end of the market, people will book a lot later because they think they can get bargains.��
The industry turmoil has also hit the budget airlines. Dame Carolyn McCall, easyJet�셲 chief executive, said she was forced to slash prices following the Paris attacks in November.
Both Ryanair and easyJet have reported demand returning to normal but prices are likely to stay low. Ryanair predicted its fares would be down 7% over the next 10 months.
Robin Byde, an analyst at broker Cantor Fitzgerald, says: �쏷he thing to remember with easyJet and Ryanair is that between them they have more than 20% of European short-haul traffic. They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.��
The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares.
That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can�셳 buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year.
�쏣asyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,�� Byde says.
The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. �쏡emand always comes back,�� she said. �쏻e�셶e seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we�셶e seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it�셲 a very, very good time to fly.��
What could be more innocent than a young child on a bicycle? Surely any child should be safe to cycle down the road in his home town. Any parent in the world would demand that basic security for their child.
So put yourselves in the shoes of the parents of the 13-year-old Israeli boy who on Monday was riding his bike when he was suddenly set upon by two Palestinian boys �� one 17, the other also 13. They stabbed him, leaving him critically wounded.
The current horror for my country is that attacks such as this are a regular occurrence. Before they stabbed the boy, his assailants had made an equally random attack on an Israeli man walking down the street �� one of several similar incidents on Monday. Every day since, more have followed: Palestinians suddenly turning on Israeli civilians who were simply minding their own business, using whatever weapon they could to kill or injure.
I�셶e spent the last week in Jerusalem, where, as the minister of public security, I have witnessed first-hand what an explosive device, a knife or even a screwdriver can do in the hands of a Palestinian intent on murdering civilians. More than 100 Israelis have been injured in the past two weeks; some have died from their wounds, murdered by terrorists as they were walking down a street or riding a bus.
Some speak of �쐋one wolf�� attacks when describing this wave of terror. But these attacks are being fuelled by violent incitement on social media, on official Palestinian radio and in sermons delivered in Gaza�셲 mosques. When Hamas posts an �쐇nstructional clip�� on YouTube teaching viewers how to murder Israeli civilians, when Palestinian radio plays songs of praise to the �쐌artyrs��, and when preachers in Gaza stand at the pulpit with a raised knife to demonstrate how to stab an Israeli, then we shouldn�셳 be surprised that young people decide to take a knife and commit murder.
Just as Isis murders innocent people because of its extremist jihadi ideology, so is the case with Palestinian terrorism, which is based on the same murderous ideology.
Amid all this incitement, the most inflammatory charge is the claim that Israel has some kind of plan to change the arrangements governing access to the area within the Old City of Jerusalem, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif. This is a lie �� and an irresponsible lie at that. I can state in no uncertain terms and on behalf of the government of Israel that my country is not seeking to change the status quo regarding the Temple Mount. We are the first in the long history of those who have governed Jerusalem to ensure that freedom of worship for all religions �� Muslims, Jews and Christians �� is continually and scrupulously maintained in the city. And that will continue.
But wild conspiracy theories concerning the site are disseminated by radical Islamist groups who would like to see the region in flames, for whom truth is irrelevant and who are guided only by their extremist ideology. This big lie, also spread by Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, is the engine in this murderous campaign against Israelis. If Palestinian leaders truly wanted calm, they would tell their people the truth: that there is and will be no change to the status of the holy sites in Jerusalem.
Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly called on Abbas over recent weeks to return to the negotiating table, with no preconditions. Abbas has responded by �쐓aluting every drop of blood shed for Jerusalem��.
This latest round of violence will continue to inflict suffering on both Israelis and Palestinians, further diminishing the confidence that is a prerequisite for talks.
Meaningful negotiations are necessary; a change of course is necessary; but for Israel and for Israelis, this is not a theoretical game or an analytical problem. It�셲 a situation that affects our daily lives in our country. A government�셲 �� any government�셲 �� prime responsibility is to provide safety: all rights that a democracy grants are dependent on that most basic right. The Israeli government will take the steps necessary to ensure that all of its citizens, Jewish and Arab, can enjoy this basic right.
Tragically, the Palestinian leadership has nurtured a culture of hatred, for decades teaching their children to become murderers. Incitement and murder can lead to tragic suffering on both sides, but Israel is here to stay. The sooner the Palestinians realise this and return to the negotiating table, the sooner we can begin to build a different future �� for the sake of all our children.
The driver of a hijacked beer delivery truck that careered into crowds on Stockholm�셲 largest shopping street, killing four and injuring many more, is believed to be a 39-year-old man from Uzbekistan previously known to the security services.
Police in Sweden�셲 capital confirmed that a man had been arrested �쐎n suspicion of a terrorist crime through murder�� after the attack on Friday afternoon, which saw the haulage vehicle drive down a pedestrianised street in the capital before crashing into a department store.Karin Rosander, a communications director at the Swedish prosecution authority, said that police suspected the arrested man had carried out the attack. He continued to be detained on Saturday.
The country�셲 national police chief, Dan Eliason, confirmed reports that the suspect was aged 39 and from the central Asian country. He added that he had previously been named in security information but was not recently under investigation, describing the suspect as �쏿 more marginal character��.
Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish security service, said: �쏷he suspect didn�셳 appear in our recent files but he earlier has been in our files.��
He said the security services were working with other nations�� security agencies on the matter, but declined to elaborate.About 15 people were injured and four killed in the attack launched on Drottninggatan, one of the city�셲 main public thoroughfares. Five of the injured had been released from hospital by Saturday morning but ten remained under care, including a child.
Police sources reportedly told the Swedish broadcaster SVT that a bag of explosives was found in the truck and a bomb disposal unit was deployed overnight. They added that the devices had not been detonated and it is claimed the suspect had �쐀urned himself��. Officials declined to confirm the reports but added that a device of some kind had been found in the truck.
�쏷he person in question has been arrested as the culprit ... in this case the driver,�� police spokesman Lars Bystrom said.
A police patrol stopped the man on Friday after the attack because he had �쐀ehaved in a way that made him interesting��, and he resembled a suspect in photos issued by police shortly after the crash.
According to a report in the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing a police source, the arrested man is a 39-year-old from Uzbekistan. He had minor injuries and broken glass on his clothes, which matched those of the man in the photos. He is said to have taken a train north from the city after the attack and was arrested in a suburb near the airport, although he lives elsewhere in Stockholm.
Police spokesman Lars Bystrom declined to comment on the reports.
Other media reports said a second man had been detained on suspicion of being connected to the main suspect. The police declined to comment on whether it had arrested any other people.
If confirmed as a terrorist attack, it would be Sweden�셲 first such assault using a large vehicle.
The prime minister, Stefan L철fven, said he had strengthened the country�셲 border controls. �쏷errorists want us to be afraid, want us to change our behaviour, want us to not live our lives normally, but that is what we�셱e going to do. So terrorists can never defeat Sweden, never,�� he said.
Restrictions on local transport imposed after the attack were lifted on Friday evening.
Fredrik Reinfeldt, the former prime minister of Sweden, said on Saturday that a liberal, open society must accept that its very freedoms make such attacks possible. �쏷he feeling is that the price of the open society is that it�셲 very tough for us to shelter against these kinds of initiatives taken by a single person,�� he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
Swedes would not reject the principle of free movement across borders, nor accept extreme levels of surveillance to stop future attacks, although there may be a debate over whether greater use of CCTV is warranted, Reinfelt said. �쏻e are preparing, we understand the risks; but we are not willing to close down the openness that is the flare of freedom that we love so much.��
The attack occurred just before 3pm (1300 GMT) when the stolen truck crashed into the corner of the bustling 횇hl챕ns department store having driven at speed down the pedestrianised Drottninggatan, situated above Stockholm�셲 central subway station.
Pictures taken at the scene showed a large blue beer truck with a mangled undercarriage smashed into the department store.
Witnesses described scenes of terror and panic. �쏛 massive truck starts driving ... and mangles everything and just drives over exactly everything,�� Rikard Gauffin told Agence France-Presse. �쏧t was so terrible and there were bodies lying everywhere ... it was really terrifying.��
The truck was towed away in the early hours of Saturday.
A witness who gave his name as Marko said he and his girlfriend were in a coffee shop near the scene when he saw the truck ram into the store. �쏦e hit a woman first, then he drove over a bunch of other people ... We took care of everyone lying on the ground,�� he told Aftonbladet.
Hasan Sidi, another passerby, told Aftonbladet he saw two elderly women lying on the ground. He said people at the scene urged him to help one of the women who was �쐀leeding to death��. Sidi said: �쏰ne of them died ... I don�셳 know if the other one made it.��
Friday�셲 attack was the latest in a string of similar assaults with vehicles in Europe, including in London, Berlin and Nice.
The British prime minister, Theresa May, spoke with her Swedish counterpart on Saturday and offered to work together against extremist attacks. A Downing Street statement said May expressed her condolences on behalf of the British people in a telephone call to L철fven.
The statement said the leaders agreed on the importance of working together to tackle such threats. In a similar attack on Westminster last month, Khalid Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians before running into the grounds of parliament where he stabbed a police officer to death. Six people died, including the attacker.
The deadliest vehicle-based attack came last year in France on the 14 July Bastille Day national holiday, when a man rammed a truck into a crowd in the Mediterranean resort of Nice, killing 86 people.

The most vulnerable part of the facilities at Sellafield, dating back to the 1950s, contain giant tanks of high level radioactive waste which has to be constantly cooled and stirred to prevent a chain reaction.
Gordon Thompson, executive director of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said he believed that documents from both the nuclear industry and the government showed neither had ever attempted a thorough analysis of the threat or the options for reducing it.
Dr Thompson, who was based in the UK for 10 years and gave evidence at the 1977 Windscale inquiry into reprocessing at Sellafield, and the Sizewell inquiry, is an expert on the potential fallout from a nuclear accident or deliberate act of terrorism.
As well as the threat of a bomb, missile or hijacked plane hitting Sellafield, Dr Thompson raises the possibility of a rogue worker or terrorist infiltrator at Sellafield sabotaging the cooling equipment which prevents the stored waste from boiling and causing a massive radioactive release.
Dr Thompson's report, sent this week in response to the committee's call for new evidence following a report it published last month, is likely further to alarm the Irish government, which has repeatedly protested about danger from the high level waste tanks at Sellafield.
The problem is that the plant which is supposed to turn this liquid waste into more managable and less dangerous glass blocks has never worked properly and a backlog cannot be cleared for another 15 years. Among the possibilities Dr Thompson raised was a vast release of liquid waste into the Irish Sea. That would contaminate fisheries and travel north on currents, making fishing in western Scotland impossible.
Anywhere downwind of Sellafield during the releases would be rendered uninhabitable probably for generations and people caught in the fall-out would have a greatly increased chance of getting cancer.
Depending on the direction of the wind, cities like Newcastle, Edinburgh and Leeds would be well within fallout range, as would be Dublin.
Dr Thompson said: "A civilian nuclear facility is a potential radiological weapon if the facility contains a large amount of radioactive material that can be released into the environment.
"A notable example of a potential radiological weapon for an enemy of the UK is the B215 facility at Sellafield. This facility houses 21 steel tanks and associated equipment in above ground concrete cells. The tanks contain high level radioactive waste in the form of self heating, acidic liquid that requries continuous cooling and agitation."
He said these tanks contained 2,400 kilograms of caeisium-137, the main cause of off-site radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident.
The total amount released from Chernobyl was 27 kilograms, almost 100 times less than the potential release from the facility at Sellafield.
Dr Thompson said that the buildings designed in the 1950s could not withstand a crash from an airliner.
The Commons defence committee in its report said that "attention has particularly focused on perceived vulnerability of nuclear installations".
However, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday that a "quick response" procedure was in place to cover the whole of the country in the event of a hijack attack.
The task of shooting down a hijacked commercial airliner has been assigned to RAF Tornado F3 fighters based at Coningsby, Lincolnshire.
The police are urging the public to help counter an increasingly complex and varied terrorist threat as a report reveals that the UK rate of convictions for terror offences related to Islamist extremism nearly doubled in the first half of this decade. The UK�셲 most senior counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, will launch the Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) campaign in Manchester on Monday.
Citing figures showing that more than a third of �쐆igh-risk�� terror investigations were aided by information provided by the public, he will say increased public engagement will be central to countering future threats.
Rowley said: �쏛dvances in technology make it more complex and challenging for us to spot would-be terrorists, because it�셲 easier for them to be in contact with others and be radicalised in a relatively short space of time.
�쏷he threat is becoming more varied and the move towards low-tech attacks on crowded places, like those we have seen in major European cities and beyond, makes it even more important everyone remains vigilant and acts by calling us confidentially if they are concerned about suspicious activity.��
The campaign launch follows the publication of a report by a right-leaning security thinktank, the Henry Jackson Society, which says the security services are getting better at spotting and prosecuting offences related to Islamist extremism, but that there remain a number of areas of concern, including a shift towards more low-tech attacks and hotspots of offending in London and Birmingham.
The researchers looked at 264 convictions for terror offences relating to 253 people arrested between 1998 and the end of 2015, as well as five suicide bombings, and divided the figures into two time periods, before and after the end of 2010.
The report found that there were on average 23 terrorism offences related to Islamist extremism a year between 2011 and 2015, compared with an average of 12 during the preceding 13 years. A third of all the offences looked at were carried out after 2010.
Only 37% of convictions were related to planning an attack, while a third related to facilitating terrorism, for example through fundraising. Bombing remained the most common form of attack planned, however, an increase in the number of more low-tech attacks attempted or carried out, such as stabbings or beheadings, is attributed to guidance from Islamic State.
The remaining convictions were for either travel offences or �쏿spirational�� terror activity that did not pose an imminent threat or was limited in scope. The proportion of offences designated as aspirational rose from 15% in the first 13 years to 23% in the last five years.
More than three-quarters of all offences were committed by people already known to the authorities in some way, having, for example, come under surveillance by the security services or incurring previous convictions.
The report also claims that women�셲 involvement in Islamist terrorism has risen significantly, accounting for 11% of offences from 2011 compared with 4% in the previous years. However, women represent a tiny proportion of total convictions, with only 18 cases since 1998, and more than half were found to have been aiding a man. More than half of the offences looked at were carried out by men in their 20s.
People born in Britain accounted for most offences, but the report suggests that certain areas of the country are producing more people implicated in Islamist terror. Of all offences, 43% were carried out by people living in London at the time of their arrest. A further 18% came from the West Midlands, four-fifths of whom were from Birmingham. Though most were raised as Muslims, 16% were converts. Deprivation also appears to play a role, with more than half of all offences carried out by people who were neither employed nor in education.
The report�셲 author, Hannah Stuart, said the figures should help the police focus their efforts to combat terrorism carried out by Islamist extremists: �쏷his report poses some particular challenges for the authorities. While it confirms widely held conceptions, such as [that] the majority of UK terror offenders are young males, it also highlights new threats that have developed since the millennium.
�쏰ur security services will be particularly concerned that the major threat continues to be home-grown �� and that females are playing an ever increasing role in terrorism. Such a high concentration of offenders in London and Birmingham will also focus the minds of policymakers when it comes to deciding where to target our counter-terrorism efforts.
�쏛s we continue to improve our policing of Islamism-inspired terrorism �� the prevalent national security threat of our age �� we should be aware that the vast majority of UK-based terrorists do not act alone. This research shows that the overwhelming majority are part of wider networks, formed online and in person, with family and friends �� and most have been radicalised here in the UK.��
The Muslim Council of Britain�셲 treasurer, Talha Ahmad, said every conviction for terror was a source of alarm, but pointed out that more terror offences had been created in recent years and that the total number related to Islamist extremism remained very low. He added that the report showed the importance of working with and supporting mainstream Muslim organisations to counteract the forces driving people to extremism.
�쏷here are at least 25% of the [terrorism] cases where they are not known to the authorities. The challenge is for society as a whole �� to play a role, and the only way we can play a role is not marginalising a single community as as suspect community.
�쏷he moment we do that, we lose an opportunity to create an environment in which it is difficult for for terrorists to thrive.��
Counter-terrorism detectives investigating fears about planning for a terrorist attack have arrested a man in a Cardiff street.
The man, 33, was detained in the third operation in a month to lead to an arrest in Britain to disrupt an alleged Islamist plot.
The arrest was made by detectives from Scotland Yard�셲 counter-terrorism command.
Two addresses were being searched in the Welsh capital, at least one of which is residential and linked to the arrested man.
The man was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Under the provision �쏿 constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist��.
The intelligence development underpinning the investigation was led by the domestic intelligence service, MI5. Counter-terrorism detectives from London and Wales were also involved in an operation described as �쐏re-planned and as a result of a pro-active investigation��.
Last month, police made arrests in Birmingham amid fears of a potential attack plot, leading to four people being charged, and earlier this month detectives made arrests in London, leading to one person being charged.
In a statement about the Cardiff arrest, police said: �쏷he arrest, which took place in the street in Cardiff, was pre-planned and as a result of a pro-active investigation by the Metropolitan police service counter-terrorism command supported by the Wales extremism and counter-terrorism unit.��
The UK threat level from Islamist terrorism has been at severe since 2014, meaning an attack is assessed as being highly likely. The main reason for the heightened level of threat is the potency of Islamic State and its desire to stage attacks against western targets.
Steve Kerr has joined the chorus of voices in the NBA that have attacked Donald Trump�셲 ban on travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.
On Sunday, the Golden State Warriors coach said the president�셲 executive order had personal resonance. �쏧 would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we�셱e trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it�셲 the wrong way of going about it,�� said Kerr whose father, Malcolm, was killed by two gunmen in 1984 while he was president of the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, later claimed responsibility for the murder. �쏧f anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. So I�셫 completely against what�셲 happening.��
Trump�셲 policy has led to stories of families being separated, while critics of the ban �� including Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham �� say it could play into the hands of groups such as Isis.
�쏧 think [the policy] is shocking. It�셲 a horrible idea,�� Kerr said. �쏧 feel for all the people that are affected. Families are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world. It�셲 going about it completely opposite. You want to solve terror, you want to solve crime, this is not the way to do it.��
The San Antonio Spurs coach, Gregg Popovich, also spoke about the ban on Sunday. �쏛s you already know, I have lots of thoughts about what we�셶e done to ourselves as a country and what we�셶e allowed to happen,�� Popovich told reporters. �쏝ut we�셪l see where this goes. Obviously the rollout today was Keystone Kops-like by any measure with objectivity. Whether you want to say it�셲 good or bad is irrelevant. But it was Keystone Kops, and that�셲 scary.��
Athletes from other sports attacked the ban. The US soccer captain, Michael Bradley, wrote on Instagram that �쐔he Muslim ban is just the latest example of someone who couldn�셳 be more out of touch with our country and the right way to move forward.�� The former UFC champion Ronda Rousey posted a cartoon of the State of Liberty on Instagram with the message: �쏷he plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty reads: �쏥ive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door! #resist��
Walk down a street in London, Edinburgh, Madrid or Paris. Sit on a cafe terrace, or in a pub garden. Check your phone, open a book, or even read a newspaper. Order another coffee, or beer, or fizzy water. Look at those around you, all doing much the same thing.
Nothing you see will tell you that you are facing any immediate threat. You will almost certainly no longer notice the barriers, metal detectors and security guards outside certain buildings in the city where you live or work. All have been part of the landscape for many years, like the reports of violent conflict in distant, dusty countries. There may be a policeman or two more than usual. But little more.
Today, however, after the attacks in Brussels last Tuesday, you will pay particular attention, as you have done after every other attack over the past 18 months or so. You may know that the number of people killed in Britain in terrorist attacks by Islamic militants �� 53 �� is statistically negligible. Or that the total in Europe �� around 400 �� is equally insignificant in a population of more than half a billion. But you can�셳 help feeling a sense of vulnerability all the same. If the bombers can hit one airport or metro system, why not the one you will use, if not today, then tomorrow? You have just become a victim of terrorism, which relies on shocking, apparently random, violence to induce irrational fear of an immediate and ubiquitous threat among a target population.
It is the tempo of the attacks, terrorists have learned, that is crucial. The massive �쐓pectacular�� operations, which may bring down a jet or a skyscraper, are still the game-changers. But the existential anxiety terrorists seek to provoke comes from the sense that it is they who have the initiative, and thus can strike where and when they want. The message of the Brussels attack was that, even after the deaths of 130 people in November in Paris, even after the identification of key militants involved in that attack, even with their satellites and sources, our security services, governments and institutions cannot keep us safe.
This then is the new normal. Or at least feels so. It is now almost 15 years since the 9/11 attacks, which killed 3,000 people. A generation across much of the planet �� and 95% of casualties in the last decade and a half have been in the Islamic world �� has never known life without the threat posed by Islamic militancy.
Which poses an obvious question: if we have seen its beginning, will we ever see its end?
In fact, no one alive today did witness the coming of Islamic militancy. Its history stretches back 150 years or more, and its deepest roots lie in the internal debate within Muslim societies, prompted by their traumatic encounter with the militarily and economically more advanced European powers in the Islamic world in the 19th century. Islamists, who sought to reform their communities through control of state institutions, were active by the 1920s, but only began to gain mass support in the 1960s. Salafists, whose aim was to revive the world�셲 Muslims through a return to the lifestyle and principles of the earliest Muslims, also expanded their movement during the first half of the 20th century. A radical fringe emerged which fused both doctrines and believed in violence. Though profoundly anti-western, these militants did not initially think to strike outside their home countries.
This came later, first in the 1980s, with growing attacks on western interests in the Middle East. Then in the 1990s, Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, sought to unify disparate, squabbling extremist factions by shifting their focus from individual regimes in the Muslim world to the US and its allies. Reporting from Pakistan and Afghanistan, I heard this new global rhetoric among militants for the first time. �쏶trike off the head of the snake,�� one Arab volunteer in Kabul told me in 1999.
The 9/11 attacks, the consequent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the conflicts that followed created a radicalised environment worldwide and allowed the rapid spread of Bin Laden�셲 violent doctrines. Bombs exploded from Bali to Marrakech. Scores of major attacks were planned, and some were carried out in Europe. Yet, by 2011, this wave of terrorism, at least in terms of its threat to the west, was in decline.
A series of elements led to a new cycle of violence: the toxic aftermath of the Arab spring, the bloody anarchy of the ongoing Syrian civil war, growing sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims, and many more.
Over previous years, a new, even more extreme school of militant thinking had been forged in the crucible of post-invasion Iraq. It was exceptionally savage and heavily informed by apocalyptic strands of thinking previously shunned by an older generation of militant ideologues.
The old project of regaining the lost power and glory of the ummah, the world Muslim community, and the construction of a �쐔rue�� Islamic society through violence, came together in the Islamic State. In June 2014, leader abu Bakr al�섳aghdadi announced a new caliphate.
Within months, analysts and officials now think, Isis was planning strikes on Europe. Why? One of the challenges posed by Isis is that it combines an irrational world view, a heavily mythologised vision of the past and a twisted interpretation of key Islam texts with rigorously practical strategic decision-making.
To create its Muslim superpower, Isis needs the loyalty of every Muslim in the world, including those in Europe. There is no room for ambivalence. As an editorial in Dabiq, the Isis magazine stated unequivocally in late 2014, the �쐅rey zone�� of compromise has to be demolished. The violence of Isis and al-Qaida aims to terrorise enemies, mobilise supporters and, perhaps above all, polarise anyone in between. A divided, decadent Europe, riven by racial and religious fear and loathing, would be weak and fertile ground for recruitment.
If the goals are esoteric, the means are not. The hundreds of young European-born men who were in the group�셲 training camps and combat brigades were the perfect candidates to prosecute this campaign of terror. One particular group included several score of young Belgians and Frenchmen. Among them were the core of the network that launched the attacks in Paris and Brussels.
Why were they there? This is one of the most complex questions of all. But, in interviews in Brussels and Paris, security officials, experts, social workers, relatives of Isis fighters and a 19-year-old woman who nearly travelled to Syria, all said the same thing. With young people in often marginal situations, in families racked by generational tensions, with ethnic or religious identity issues, facing personal or professional setbacks, surrounded by delinquency or borderline behaviour among peers, one problem crops up everywhere: gangs. Isis, to young men like those who killed a total of 161 people in the French and Belgian capitals, is �쐔he biggest street gang of all��.
The similarities include age range, so-called �쐅roup think��, propensity for violence, rituals, and a sense of empowerment, Belgian analysts have pointed out. Attraction does not depend on reasoned argument, or ideology. The most powerful recruiters are friends or family. It is who you know that is important in radicalisation, not what you know. Significantly, about half of Belgian extremist recruits have criminal records, local officials have said. Although most offences are relatively minor �� theft or assault �� there is an increasing number of more serious offences.
This mirrors trends seen elsewhere. Almost a decade ago, Saudi Arabian officials noted how local militants in the kingdom were progressively less bookish and more indiscriminate in their violence as the years passed. This is true more broadly of the profile of Islamic militants over the last two decades.
Members of an older generation �� such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, an ascetic, bespectacled 64-year-old, who has led al-Qaida since Bin Laden�셲 death in 2011 �� appear increasingly out of touch. Al-Qaida�셲 videos emphasise theological argument, aimed at those Muslims uncertain of the group�셲 radical re-interpretation of core tenets of the faith. Isis, by contrast, prefers short clips that promise camaraderie and adrenaline.
In one video released last week, the historic mission of the restoration of the caliphate, or the legitimacy of the attacks in Europe, was explained through religious references, illustrated by images from what looked like the Hollywood blockbuster Troy.
Publications such as Dabiq, which is published in several languages, even emphasise sexual opportunity, either through marriage to another volunteer, or rape. Pictures on social media show young men posing with guns, even luxury cars �� fulfilling aspirations conceived in tough neighbourhoods in northern Europe �� in Syria.
It is there that the final transformation takes place. Few leave their homes in Europe with dreams of mass murder or martyrdom. These come in the harsh, closed world of Isis.
Geraldine, the mother of an 18-year-old who travelled from Molenbeek to die in Syria fighting with Isis, described how her son had changed. The young man, who had previously been �쐆is mother�셲 son��, had slowly been effaced by a fanatic and stopped talking to his father on the telephone because he was a �쐀ad Muslim��. All terrorist groups, like armies, have long recognised the value of isolation. �쏧 can do nothing with a recruit who goes home at the end of the week,�� an Irish Republican Army trainer once told me. And all know, too, that when the killing starts, a different dynamic takes over.
Some of the most chilling words to come out of the last few years of violence were those spoken to police negotiators by Mohamed Merah, a 23-year-old Frenchman who shot seven people, including an eight-year-old girl at a Jewish school in Toulouse in France in 2012. �쏷he day �� I killed, that morning when I woke up I didn�셳 think I was going to attack,�� Merah recalled, hours before his own death. �쏧t happened very quickly. And I had to do it all, all alone, to shoot �� [to] get away �� [But] the moment I saw I had killed a second time, I felt my heart lighter�� and I wanted to do it again. And with each operation I felt better and better.��
So when will it end? Here there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Isis appears to be weakening �� at least in its heartland of eastern Syria and western Iraq. It has lost key personnel �� the Pentagon has claimed a US drone killed the Isis deputy leader last week �� and territory. Losing ground means losing control of people and so fewer opportunities for extortion �� or taxation �� and expropriation.
For many Sunnis in Syria or Iraq, the point of siding with Isis was that it was the best of a bad set of options in a violent and anarchic conflict. Isis, for all its flaws, offered protection.
If this is no longer the case, support for the group becomes a liability. Isis advanced with astonishing speed, exploiting local disputes and division. Localised cooperation, or at least acquiescence, could become opposition with equal rapidity.
On the front lines, reports suggest the commitment of fighters is wavering. Isis may start losing its major urban centres. Reverses are particularly difficult for a group with such an elevated and uncompromising view of its own mission. Setbacks can always be described as trials sent to test the faithful. But major defeats will be harder for leaders to explain away. It will be hard to claim the existence of a caliphate if the caliph has no seat �� there is little that is empowering about being on the losing side. Retreat could easily become a rout.
This has happened before. Over the last 40 years we have seen several cycles of Islamic militant violence. Each has followed a similar trajectory of rise and fall over a 10- to 15-year period. The turning point in each case came after early support for extremists, or at least their aims, disappeared and governments and security services thrashed out effective strategies.
We are now in the early phases of a new cycle. The good news is that there is every reason to believe that it will follow the same arc. We can be reasonably confident that, after their evident failures, security services and policymakers in Europe will get their collective act together to confront the new threat.
Perhaps as early as next year, Isis may begin to fragment in its core territories. Its attraction to a tiny number of European Muslims will vanish. There will be more bombings, and deaths and injuries, in Europe and elsewhere, but in time the threat will ease.
However, there is one more historical observation worth making. Terrorism of one sort or another has been a part of our modern world for 200 years, and every new cycle of violence has been under way well before the previous one has ended. Islamic militancy was growing in the Middle East by the mid-1970s, well before the wave of secular, leftist or nationalist terrorism that dominated attention during that decade began to fade. Al-Qaida was founded in 1988, a decade before gaining global notoriety with strikes on US embassies in East Africa. The origins of Isis reach back to 2004. Few paid it much attention until 2014.
The conclusion is simple. We cannot know what form the next threat will take. But we can be certain that there will be one, and that it is already developing now.

Two British Muslims cleared of helping the 7 July bombers choose their targets were today sentenced to seven years in jail each for planning to attend a terrorist training camp.
Waheed Ali, 25, and Mohammed Shakil, 32, were yesterday found not guilty at Kingston crown court of conspiring to cause explosions with the four men who carried out the attacks that killed 52 people in 2005.
The pair, who were arrested as they were about to board a flight to Pakistan in 2007, were found guilty of conspiracy to attend a terrorist training camp. They have already spent two years in jail on remand.
The judge, Mr Justice Gross, told Ali and Shakil they had committed an offence "at a serious level".
"Your intention, but for your apprehension, was to attend a real camp and to use real guns in training at that camp," he said. "This was not play acting and you were determined players, not naive dupes."
He told the pair they had a "very real prospect of reoffending".
Gross said the most important factor in his sentencing decision was to deter others attending such camps.
The trial heard that an estimated 1,000 young Muslims from the UK visited training camps in Pakistan between 1998 and 2003.
The judge said: "It must be made entirely clear, if necessary through sentences of an appropriate length, that such conduct is unacceptable."
Referring to the acquittal of Ali, Shakil and co-accused Sadeer Saleem, 28, on the separate charge of conspiracy to cause explosions, Mr Justice Gross said the jury's decision must be respected.
"Defendants must receive a fair trial and must not be convicted unless the jury has been made sure of their guilt," he said. "That is a strength of our system. By its verdict, the jury in this case indicated the crown had not made it sure the defendants were party to the conspiracy to cause explosions that ended in the July 7 bombings. That verdict is to be respected."
The head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command, Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall, said Ali and Shakil shared the same extremist beliefs as the London bombers, with whom they had grown up in Beeston, Leeds.
They were acquitted of carrying out a reconnaissance mission in London with two of the men, Hasib Hussain and Jermaine Lindsay, seven months before the explosions. They insisted the trip had been an innocent social outing for sightseeing and visiting family, and had nothing to do with the attacks. During their two-day trip to London in 2004 the three visited the London Eye, the Natural History Museum and the London Aquarium.
The men were retried after an earlier jury failed to reach verdicts. After eight days of deliberations the jury cleared them unanimously, along with Saleem.
The total cost of the two trials is likely to exceed 짙5m and the families of the 7 July victims say the verdicts mean no one is likely to ever be brought to justice for the attacks. They are demanding a full independent inquiry into the atrocity.
Bereaved families and survivors have called on the government to publish a second Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report into the bombings without delay.
The list includes the PKK, the Kurdish Workers' Party which has a large following in Britain; ETA, the Basque separatist group; LTTE, the Tamil separatist group, and a number of Sikh organisations.
They also include Al-Qai'da, a loose organisation led by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi now living in Afghanistan wanted in the US over attacks on American embassies in East Africa in 1998.
The Home Office concedes the large majority of the groups on the list - which does not include animal rights or environmental activists - have not attacked British targets. However, Jack Straw told MPs yesterday he was "entirely satisfied" that they were all "concerned in terrorism" under the new, broad, definition laid down in a law which came into force earlier this month.
He said his decision, which will not be effective until it has been approved by parliament, was based on the advice of MI5 and lawyers. Charles Clarke, the Home Office minister, insisted that the move was not directed at any "specific community" or those campaigning "in a peaceful way for political change". He told journalists: "Any perception that we are targeting the Muslim community is entirely wrong".
Home Office ministers arranged meetings with ethnic groups before announcing the list. One of those who attended, Yousuf Bhailok, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, last night expressed his "grave concern" at the list. It included groups engaged in legitimate activities against the abuse of human rights or for the liberation of Palestine, he said.
Mr Clarke insisted the home secretary had acted independently. "Foreign policy was not a consideration", he said.
The new Terrorism Act, which for the first time allows the home secretary to proscribe foreign-based groups, defines terrorism as "the use or threat of action" designed to "influence the government or to intimidate the public ... for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause". Actions cited include those involving "serious violence against a person" in Britain or abroad. The act covers fundraising.
The measure, like its predecessor, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, covers Northern Ireland-based groups, 13 of which - on both sides- will remain proscribed. However, charges under the PTA have rarely been made in Northern Ireland where the police have usually used conventional criminal legislation against suspected terrorists. Under the act, which makes it an offence to invite support for, or attend meetings by proscribed groups, individuals and groups can complain to an appeals commission.
John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: "Banning organisations and criminalising membership is a serious attack on basic rights of free speech and assembly."
혮 The Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, last night met the UK Association of the Palestinian Community. Dr Ghada Karmi, its chairman, said many Palestinians felt they were unfairly under surveillance on suspicion of terrorism.
혮 Al-Qa'ida: inspired by Osama bin Laden, made no attacks in UK.
혮 Al-Gama'at al Islamiya: directed primarily at Egyptian government, no evidence of terrorism by UK members.
혮 Salafist Group for Call and Combat: also aimed at Algeria, no overt presence in UK.
혮 Harakat Mujahideen, Jaish e Mohammed, and Lashkar e Tayyaba: all seeking Kashmir independence, supporters in UK.
혮 Hamas Izz al-Bin al-Qassem Brigades Islamic group in Palestine, not operated outside Israel, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - Shaqaqi.
혮 Abu Nidal Organisation, no known members in UK.
혮 Islamic Army of Aden, some support in UK.
혮 Mujaheddin e Khalq, Iranian dissident group has not attacked the west.
혮 Revolutionary People's Liberation Party Front. A Turkish group engaged in "overt political activity", according to Home Office.
Brutality turns people into numbers �� 129 dead in Paris, the worst death toll from terror in Europe since 191 died in Madrid �� and it is the job of the bystander to turn the numbers back into people. Everybody understands this: that the real news is in the wall of faces, as the concert-goers, diners, football fans and revellers are slowly patchworked together with names and nationalities and final moments and the grief they left behind.
But part of that convention, of giving back to each victim his or her particularity, is an attempt to reassure oneself. The Charlie Hebdo attack became a conversation about freedom of speech, the giving of offence, what�셲 funny and what isn�셳; the attack at the kosher market became a conversation about antisemitism. And while it is perfectly natural to discuss these finer points, there was an underlying motivation: the victims had to be, not blamed, but placed at a remove. That was the only way to make the massacre manageable. It had to be them, and couldn�셳 have been us, because they were cartoonists, or Jewish, or �� doubly at risk �� both.
On Friday that distance collapsed. If a victim could be a person selling T-shirts at a concert, it could be anybody. If to sit in a restaurant can make a person a target, then to walk down the street is an open invitation to a killer. If Paris is the capital of prostitution and vice, then so is London.
The Islamic State supporter trolling mourners on Twitter with the vow that London, Rome and Washington would be next needn�셳 have bothered: we have entered the realm of the indiscriminate, where everyone, in every city, is fair game. Distinctions are no longer relevant: no one is too young or old, too rich or poor. You�셱e either with the caliphate or you�셱e against it.
Every generation has its shadow, a threat that seems real enough at the time and only hindsight makes implausible. When it wasn�셳 terrorism, it was the fear of nuclear holocaust, an eventuality that loomed for decades before finally being rendered obsolete by its own ridiculousness. (I mean, really: nation states standing braced to destroy the world, rattling their missiles at one another. The sheer man-hours of anxiety created by this pantomime, the waste of wellbeing �� it was, above anything else, absurd.)
It is the vanity of every era to think that the danger it faces is unprecedented and unique; where previously that distinction was conferred by atomic technology, now it is in the nature of our enemy. Never before have two civilisations been so implacably opposed; never has a death cult been so impervious to reason, to humanity, to rules. Never has anyone faced an enemy for whom brutality is so energising and so engrossing, so much a part of the plan �� for whom the Geneva conventions mean so little.
The terrorists themselves amp up their unique selling proposition with macabre videos and histrionic statements, but this is, again, a pantomime. The operative word is not �쏧slamic�� but �쐓tate�� �� they are butcher-entrepreneurs who claim they are engaged in the creation of a state. The overbaked religiosity of their justification should be treated not with fear, but with contempt. Yet these terrorist acts themselves do generate fear, how could they not?
The other immediate aftermath of an attack like this is the clamorous bravado that kicks in. It becomes fashionable, as it did after the London bombings in 2005, to announce that nothing has changed; that if we feel afraid, if we change our behaviour or our route to work or make even the subtlest adjustment to our perception of risk, then the terrorists �쐗ill have won��.
The terrorists will also have won, though, if we look at a risk and refuse to see it; if we pretend a confidence that we don�셳 have; if we disengage our rational minds in the quest for the blitz spirit. If the raison d�셞tre of the terrorist is to poison a society with terror, that society must find the antidote, not pretend that it wasn�셳 toxic.
The fear is well founded, upon this simple, tragic asymmetry: the person who destroys life will always have power over the people who cherished it. A person who is prepared to kill in the service of an idea can unleash unimaginable pain; there is no protection against it, unless it is to not care about anything �� or more pertinently, anyone �� in the first place.
To live with the fear of assailants who would do this gleefully, who would open up grief as a PR exercise, is no small thing. Great British phlegm and a readiness to pretend things are other than the way they are won�셳 help.
Admit to fear: it is more than a requirement of honesty. It is the precondition for solidarity, since as much fanfare as you make about standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of France, it is only when you make a frank account of your own feelings that you can begin to empathise. Stepping inside the skin of another is an impossible task if you�셱e having first to clamber over the barriers of a constructed, unreflective courage that you don�셳 really feel.
One of the five men accused of plotting a terrorist attack to take place in Melbourne�셲 CBD on Christmas Day has been released, with the other four being charged and three already refused bail.
Three men �� Hamza Abbas, 21, of Flemington, Ahmed Mohamed, 24, from Meadow Heights and 26-year-old Abdullah Chaarani �� were each charged on Friday with one count of preparing or planning a terror attack. All faced court on Friday afternoon and were refused bail.
Ibrahim Abbas, a 22-year-old man from Broadmeadows, was charged with the same offence at an out-of-sessions hearing on Friday night. He appeared before Melbourne Magistrates Court with a black eye on Saturday. His lawyer said Abbas sustained the black eye during police raids on Friday.
Counter terrorism police allege the four men were behind an Islamic State-inspired plot targeting Flinders Street Station, Federation Square and St Paul�셲 Cathedral on Christmas Day.
Police arrested the men following raids that involved about 400 police officers on Thursday night, at properties in Flemington, Meadow Heights, Dallas, Campbellfield and Gladstone Park.
On Friday morning Victoria�셲 police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said the attack police alleged was being planned for Christmas Day was going to involve �쏿n explosive event, the use of explosives, and we gathered evidence to support that��.
Ashton said there would be an increased police presence for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG and over the new year period, but there was no longer any direct threat, saying police had �쐍eutralised�� the situation.
The Australian federal police commissioner, Andrew Colvin, said compared with other threatened attacks in the past few years, the alleged plot �쐁oncerns me more than any other event that I�셶e seen��.
�쏷hey had moved very quickly from an intention to a capability, and developed capability, including quite progressed plans, we will allege.��
�쏷his news will be of great concern to all Australians,�� the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said. �쏻e are approaching the Christmas season, a time when we come together in peace and love, with our families. We congregate in public places for Christmas, for New Year�셲 Eve. It is a time of happiness and joy.��
During the day two men had been taken prisoner and several others killed or wounded and the fighters did not talk much. One of them cleaned and checked a captured light machine gun while the others ate the remnants of a thin chicken stew cooked several hours earlier. It was 3am and everyone knew, at least if the routine established over the previous two days continued, the bombing would not start again for two or three hours and now was the time to sleep.
Through the day the B-52s had been overhead. We had watched their distinctive quadruple contrails tracking in straight lines from the north towards their targets. Then they would make a sharp turn to the west and we would see great gouts of smoke, dirt, rock and flame on the steep slopes above us. A second or so later the noise and the blast would reach us, tugging at our clothes. When I woke three hours later all the men in the room were awake. They wrapped their blankets over their thin shalwar kameez, hitched the straps of their Kalashnikovs over their shoulders, put magazines in their pockets and moved outside into the cold. Many of their blankets, bought in the city of Jalalabad some 30 miles away, had been imported from Iran and were bright green and pink and covered in gold prints of large flowers. The men moved off in small groups towards their assault positions.
The sky had begun to lighten. To the north, behind us, lay Jalalabad and the dirt-coloured desert around it. Strands of mist hung over the irrigated lands around the Kabul River. And then high overhead, scoring confident white lines across the pale sky like a steel cutter across glass, came the first set of the quadruple vapour trails of the B-52s of the day. When they appeared the trails were white against the dawn sky. But the rays of the early morning sun were angled up into the sky like searchlights and when they struck the vapour trails, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, the sun's rays turned them a pink as bright and as out of place as the printed flowers on the blankets wrapped around the soldiers thin shoulders. The trails powered forwards towards the mountains and then dipped away to the West. And then came the boiling, orange flames and the oily, dark smoke and the noise rolling over the hills.
The Americans had started bombing the caves - known locally as Tora Bora - on November 30th 2001. Seventeen days earlier the Taliban and their Arab and Pakistani auxiliaries had pulled out of Kabul. Within hours the troops of the Northern Alliance had entered the city. With a group of mujahideen I had smuggled myself across the border and arrived in Jalalabad a few hours after it had been liberated. Over the next weeks American warplanes and special forces troops scoured Afghanistan mopping up retreating Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. Resistance was minimal.
Osama bin Laden was in Kandahar, the southern desert city that was the spiritual home and administrative headquarters of the Taliban, when the air strikes started. By early November he, his close aides and several hundred of his Arab followers had moved up to Tora Bora. By mid December he, his senior aides, much of the Taliban high command, and hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters were gone. They had slipped the net.
I left Tora Bora, spent a few days in Jalalabad and then drove out to Pakistan. I arrived in London in time for the office Christmas party.
Though I had been reporting on Afghanistan, Pakistan and bin Laden almost full time for nearly four years, and had been covering conflicts, coups and natural disasters for a decade, nothing had prepared me for what I had seen. In fact living and working in the region for so long had made the shock altogether more powerful. I had witnessed countless scenes of grief and deprivation in Afghanistan but, though horrific and tragic, most of it seemed to make sense, to be somehow part of the essence of the place. What I had seen at Tora Bora did not make any sense at all.
It was clear that it was impossible to explain what had happened merely by looking at events in southwest Asia. What had occurred at Tora Bora was the culmination of a huge and complex historical process. The men who had been under the bombs were from Yemen, Egypt, the Sudan and Algeria and a dozen other countries as well as from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The reason for what had happened at Tora Bora lay hidden in their histories.
I also wanted to answer other questions. What was the nature of the threat that now confronted my way of life, my culture, my values, my own personal security and that of those I love? Should I genuinely be frightened of bombs on the London underground, hijackings at Paris Orly, gas attacks in Los Angeles or dirty bombs in Chicago?
Little that had previously been published helped. It was clear to me that profound misconceptions were widespread. Foremost among them was the idea that bin Laden led a cohesive and structured terrorist organisation called "al-Qaeda". Every piece of evidence I came across in my own work contradicted this notion of al-Qaeda as an "Evil Empire" with an omnipotent mastermind at its head. Such an idea was undoubtedly comforting - destroy the man and his henchmen and the problem goes away - but it was clearly deeply flawed. As a result the debate over the prosecution of the ongoing "war on terror" had been skewed.
Instead of there being a reasoned and honest look at the root causes of resurgent Islamic radicalism the discussion of strategies in the war against terror had been almost entirely dominated by the language of high-tech weaponry, militarism and eradication.
One question remained, and remains, largely unanswered: what is al-Qaeda? The word itself is critical. Al-Qaeda comes from the Arabic root qaf-ayn-dal. It can mean a base, such as a camp or a home, or a foundation. It can also mean a precept, rule, principle, maxim, formula or method.
For the most extreme elements among the Islamic radicals who joined the Afghans in the long battle through the 1980s against the Soviets, the word was understood in a very specific sense. Abdullah Azzam, the chief ideologue of the non-Afghan militants and a spiritual mentor of bin Laden, used it to describe the role he envisaged the most committed of the Muslim volunteers who had fought the Soviets playing once the war in Afghanistan was over. In 1987 he wrote: "Every principle needs a vanguard to carry it forward and [to] put up with heavy tasks and enormous sacrifices. This vanguard constitutes the strong foundation (al qaeda al-sulbah) for the expected society."
Azzam was talking about a mode of activism and a tactic, not talking about a particular organisation. Indeed it would be a year or more before bin Laden formed his group. Azzam was using the word to denote a purpose, an ideal and a function. He, and subsequently bin Laden too, saw the role of al-Qaeda, the vanguard, as being to radicalise and mobilise those Muslims who had hitherto rejected their extremist message. They would act like any revolutionary vanguard, as Lenin or indeed the French revolutionaries had imagined. Modern radical Islamic thought is heavily influenced by Western radical political thought, on the right and the left, and the concept of the vanguard is only one of a number of concepts, and tactics, borrowed from thinkers ranging from Trotsky and Mao to Hitler and Heidegger.
Bin Laden and a number of close associates acted on Azzam's suggestion and, probably sometime in 1988 or early 1989, set up a militant group in Peshawar, the frontier city in western Pakistan. They hoped the group would act as a "vanguard" in the coming struggle. The unity that a common purpose had forced on the disparate groups of Islamic extremists fighting against the Soviets was disintegrating. National and ethnic divisions re-asserted themselves among the volunteers. Bin Laden's group was formed with the aim of rousing Muslims, through active campaigning or "propaganda by deed", to create an "international army" that would unite the umma or world Islamic community against oppression. The group was small, comprising not more than a dozen men, and there was little to distinguish it from the scores of other groups operating, forming and dissolving in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Islamic world.
Bin Laden left Pakistan in 1989 and returned to his homeland of Saudi Arabia. In 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, bin Laden, several other Arab veterans of the war in Afghanistan and a number of Afghan commanders, offered to form an army of Islamic militants to protect the land of Mecca and Medina. The Saudi regime rejected bin Laden's plan and the 32 year old militant began to work to reform of his own country. The al-Qaeda project languished. In 1991 bin Laden left his native land and fled, via Pakistan, to Sudan where he remained until 1996.
Western intelligence officials have been criticised for being slow to recognise al-Qaeda. This is unfair. In his first few years in Sudan bin Laden was at least as interested in arboriculture and road construction as in creating an international legion of Islamic militants. His own group had barely expanded beyond the dozen or so individuals who had pledged allegiance to him back in 1988 or 1989 and he was heavily reliant on the know-how and resources of larger and more established militant outfits such as Egytpian Islamic Jihad. Nor was he connected to the raft of attacks, including that on the World Trade Centre, there were in this period. His involvement in Somalia and the famous "blackhawk down" episode was marginal.
In 1996 bin Laden moved from Sudan to Afghanistan. This provided the first real opportunity for him to build something that could genuinely be described as an organised terrorist structure.
What bin Laden was able to do in Afghanistan was provide a central focus for many of the disparate elements within contemporary Islamic militancy. This led, not to the formation of a huge and disciplined group "with tentacles everywhere", but to a temporary concentration of many of the different strands within modern Islamic militancy on a single place and project. This period, from 1996 to 2001, is when "al-Qaeda" matured.
"Al-Qaeda" consisted of three elements. The first element was the "al-Qaeda hard core", the few dozen associates who had stayed with bin Laden since the late 1980s. Their numbers were boosted by the number of experienced militants, most of whom had been active independently for several years, who made their way to Afghanistan to join bin Laden there. One such was Khaled Sheikh Mohammed who had been involved in attacks in the Philippines and elsewhere. Most of these militants came for purely pragmatic reasons. For men who had spent years trying to mobilise and act, struggling all the while with domestic security services, Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 was like a department store for Islamic terrorists. Recruits, knowledge, ideas and even cash could be had off the shelf. Bin Laden and his associates were running a whole floor, the biggest, the best-stocked and the most glitzy.
A second element of "al-Qaeda" involves the scores of other militant Islamic groups around the world which have, or had, some kind of relationship with bin Laden or figures connected to him. But imagining that all these groups were all created or run by bin Laden is to denigrate the particular local factors that led to their emergence.
Tracing the links between various groups and the "al-Qaeda hardcore" not easy. Even within individual movements different factions had different relations with "al-Qaeda". For example, the Ansar ul Islam group that emerged in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq in the autumn of 2001 comprised three different factions. Though two of them set off to Afghanistan to meet senior al-Qaeda leaders in the spring of 2001, a third had been unwilling to deal with bin Laden or those around him. Only when bin Laden specifically sent an emissary did they "come on board". By the end of 2001 Ansar was joined by Arab fighters who had fled the US-led onslaught in Afghanistan, some of whom had been close to the al-Qaeda leadership. Ansar was one ostensibly one group, yet included many different relationships to "al-Qaeda". In that it is a microcosm of the broader militant movement.
It is also worth pointing out that at no stage did any Ansar members have any relations with Saddam Hussein. Such claims rested on the thinnest of evidence.
Indeed claims of any links between Saddam and al-Qaeda were based on a fundamental misconception of the nature of modern Islamic militancy. They depended, largely, on the idea that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born militant allegedly sheltered by Baghdad, was close to bin Laden. Yet Western European intelligence reports, compiled in 2003, reveal that his group was formed "in opposition" to al-Qaeda. Again, if only if al-Qaeda is, wrongly, conceived of as a single organisation encompassing the whole of contemporary radical Islamic activism could one say that al-Zarqawi was "al-Qaeda". It is also true that representatives of bin Laden did have some contact with Saddam Hussein's regime, as the American administration has often said. But bin Laden rejected all of Baghdad's approaches - a point that is less often made by hawks in Washington.
I was able to study Ansar ul Islam in some depth when I was working in northern Iraq in 2002. I had first been to Kurdistan in 1991 when, as a young and cocky student I had spent several weeks one summer carrying a Kalashnikov alongside the peshmerga fighters there. In 2002 the results of hardline proselytisation by Gulf-based Islamic groups and the global spread of bin Laden's message was becoming obvious as the "salafi-jihadi" ideology spread among the previously secular Kurds. On my return to Kurdistan, I had an opportunity to interview many of Ansar's members, including Didar, a failed suicide bomber.
I met Didar in the eastern Kurdish city of Sulaimania in Northern Iraq. He was born, he said, in 1985 and raised in the sprawling city of Arbil, one of nine children. His father was unemployed but, as he had two sons working (illegally) in Britain, the family had a good standard of living. They had their own house and car. All the children went to school and Didar, the 6th child, studied until he was 14.
Didar's upbringing was not particularly religious. Like most Kurds he went to the mosque to pray several times a week and kept the fast at Ramadan but little else. Nor had he been involved in politics though, he said, he felt strongly that things were not right with the world from his early teens. His education, he told me, was unlikely to get him a decent job and he had few friends. When he left school in 1999, without employment, he didn't have much to do so started going to the mosque a lot. Soon he was spending every evening there and was invited to join a Quranic study group. He enjoyed the meetings and liked being with his new friends. Didar's teacher at the mosque gave him books and pamphlets to read. Some were hardline tracts subsidised by Saudi Arabian quasi-governmental groups. Others were reprints of Abdullah Azzam's works. His teacher explained Azzam's doctrine that jihad was the duty of every Muslim man and told him that men like Osama bin Laden were true Muslims whose examples should be followed. He introduced Didar to other young men with similar ideas. This mode of recruitment, or rather induction, is similar to that of many young Islamic radicals.
In November of 2001 Didar was told by his teacher that a group called Ansar ul Islam had announced a jihad in Kurdistan. Didar had not heard of the organisation before but was keen to join it. The two men took a bus to the stronghold of the group in the mountains east of Sulaimania. The Ansar base was surrounded on three sides by fighters from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two secular groups who dominate politics locally. On the fourth side was the Iranian border. Around 40 Arabs had recently arrived there from Afghanistan, joining around 500 Kurds, and providing a battle-hardened, fanatical edge.
A Kurd who had spent time in bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan was running the training of Ansar's new recruits, and for the next three months Didar was instructed in basic infantry tactics, explosives, urban warfare and assassinations. The training followed the syllabus that had been taught to the group's representatives who had made it to Afghanistan in the previous year and is similar to that outlined in a series of notebooks I had found at a training camp in Khost, the eastern Afghan town that was the centre of international Islamic militancy in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 about a week before the battle at Tora Bora.
Every morning the Ansar recruits would rise for morning prayers and then do physical training until the sun came over the horizon. They spent the rest of the day training, in lectures or reading the Koran. The idea of ishtishahd, or "martyrdom operations" was first raised by the Arab instructors but it was one of Didar's friends, a 22 year old who he had met in the mosque at Arbil, who starting talking about suicide seriously.
"Hisham quoted all the verses of the Quran and repeated the prophet's teaching on ishtishad and every day we talked about it - I decided that I wanted to do this too. I knew that PUK people were kufr (unbelievers) and that our duty was to fight against the kufr to free the umma. I told [our leader], that I was ready and then during the night they called me on the radio and asked me to come to them. They showed me the jacket and how it worked. Then we had lunch."
Didar was talking to me in the office of the PUK security chief. While he spoke the chief went to a cupboard and pulled out the jacket that had been taken off Didar when he had been arrested. It had two slabs of TNT over the chest and in the small of the back and was made of blue nylon. A belt contained more explosives. There were two metal switches, one for the jacket and one for the belt. I sat and clicked them back and forth, listening to the metallic tick, as Didar continued.
"After seeing the jacket I went back to our base."
"What date was it?", I asked.
"It was the 12th of June," he said. "Because it was during the World Cup."
You were watching the World Cup?"
There were no televisions because they were haram [forbidden]. But I was following it in the newspapers."
What was your favourite team?"
"England. Michael Owen and I like McManaman and David Seaman."
 "England is your favourite team and you are about to blow yourself up in the jihad against kufr?"
"Politics is one thing. Football is something else."
Didar was driven to a house on the outskirts of Halabjah. He had dinner at the house of a sympathiser. Then they watched a Jackie Chan film on a DVD.
"I didn't dream. I slept fine. I knew I was going to paradise so was very calm. At just after five pm I [left the house]. I was calm. I was thinking about paradise. The bus went through the bazaar and I got down just before the PUK office and walked up to it with the switch in my pocket and my hand on it. I walked up to the official at the door and gave him the name of a man who I thought would be inside and he said what is that underneath your shirt, and I said nothing and he asked again and I said it's TNT and then they arrested me."
Didar's story is revealing. It tells us much about the real nature of "al-Qaeda". Bin Laden does not have the power to issue orders that are instantly obeyed. He is not the commander in chief of an army. Bin Laden does not kidnap young men and brainwash them. Both the young men who flocked to Afghanistan to seek military and terrorist training and the leaders of more established groups who were happy to link themselves with bin Laden's group did so of their volition.
As is clear from the testimony of recruits in the training camps run by the "al-Qaeda" hardcore in Afghanistan nobody was kept there against their will. Most overcame considerable obstacles to reach the camps. Indeed bin Laden's associates spent much of their time selecting which of the myriad requests for assistance they would grant. The requests came from everywhere from Morocco to Malaysia. A group in Singapore even made a video showing their intended targets which they showed to Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's military commander. Other militants formulated their plans in the training camps and then approached the leadership. Those who had not got any ideas of their own were refused assistance and told to return when they had thought of something.
These requests, like the recruits who carried them, originated in the huge swathe of largely young men who are sufficiently motivated to want to devote substantial proportions of their lives and energies to the most extreme form of Islamic militancy. In very broad terms they share the key ideas, and the key objectives, of bin Laden and the "al-Qaeda" hardcore. They, like Didar, subscribe, whether involved in a radical group or not, to the "al-Qaeda" worldview. They speak the "al-Qaeda" language. They are committed to a certain way of thinking about the world, of understanding events, of interpreting and behaving. This ideology, a composite of the common elements of all the various strands of modern Islamic radical thought, is currently the most widespread, and the fastest growing, element of what makes up the phenomenon currently, and largely erroneously, labelled "al-Qaeda". The smoke and the vapour trails over Tora Bora signalled the end of Afghanistan as a favoured destination for aspirant terrorists. But the "war on terror" has so far done nothing to eradicate the reasons for the volunteers wanting to travel to the training camps or to deal with the grievances behind the constant applications fielded by bin Laden and his lieutenants.
The war in Afghanistan ended a specific, and in many ways anomalous, period. The camps were destroyed, the militants who had joined bin Laden there were scattered. The al-Qaeda hardcore, the first component of al-Qaeda that we identified above, was virtually destroyed. However the threat is more grave than ever before.
Thirty years ago a new Islamic political ideology began to resonate amongst millions of young men and women across the Muslim world. This ideology was a sophisticated and genuine intellectual effort to find an Islamic answer to the challenges posed by the West's cultural, economic and political superiority. In the middle of the 20th century nationalist anti-imperialism was the dominant ideology. Then, at least in the Middle East, it was pan-Arabism. Both failed to solve the problems of the Islamic world. Now Islam is seen the solution. But over the decades Islamic activism has changed. Once Islamic activists thought primarily in terms of achieving power or reforming their own nation. There was room in their programme for gradualism and compromise, for a huge multiplicity of different strands of political thought, for the parochial, radical and conservative movements of rural areas and for the clever, educated and aware ideologues of the cities. There was also room, on the movement's periphery, for those extremists who were committed to violence and who saw the world as a battlefield between the forces of good and evil, of belief and unbelief.
But increasingly, and this is a trend that is accelerating, the extremists are no longer perceived as the "lunatic fringe". Instead they are seen as the standard bearers. And their language is now the dominant discourse in modern Islamic activism. Their debased, violent, nihilisitic, anti-rational millenarianism has become the standard ideology aspired to by angry young Muslim men. This is the genuine victory of bin Laden and our greatest defeat in the "war on terror".
In the weeks immediately following the tragedy of September 11th there was a genuine interest in understanding: why?. Why "they" hate us, why "they" were prepared to kill themselves, why such a thing could happen. That curiosity has dwindled and is being replaced by other questions: how did it happen, how many of "them" are there, how many are there left to capture and kill. Anyone who tries to "explain" the roots of the threat now facing all of us, to answer the "why", to elaborate who "they are", risks being dismissed as ineffectual or cowardly. To ask "why" is to lay oneself open to accusations of lacking the moral courage to face up to the "genuine" threat and the need to meet it with force and aggression. Many characterise this threat, dangerously and wrongly, as rooted in a "clash of civilizations."
This attitude not only plays into the hands of the extremists but, by downplaying the importance of genuine causes, risks encouraging tactics that are counterproductive. I hope to redress the balance. As I watched the bombs falling at Tora Bora I had asked the question why. My book is my attempt to find some answers.

A terror attack at a luxury hotel in Mali�셲 capital has left at least 21 people dead, including two militants, and highlighted the world�셲 growing vulnerability to extremist violence.
Less than a week after the Paris gun and suicide bomb attacks in which 130 people were killed, a group of heavily armed and seemingly well-trained gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako.They drove unchallenged into an inner compound, detonated grenades, opened fire at security guards and then took hostage about 170 people �밶mong them diplomats, a celebrated Guinean singer and air crew from France and Turkey, as well as Indian and Chinese nationals. Three Chinese, one American and one Belgian were among the dead.
The president of Mali, Ibrahim Boubacar K챘ita, speaking on national television late on Friday evening, declared a national state of emergency effective from midnight. As well as the 19 people and two Islamist militants killed, he said seven people had been wounded in the attack.
The siege was the latest in a string of recent high-profile terror attacks, from bombings in Beirut and the downing of a Russian airline over the Sinai desert to the events in Paris.
By late Friday night Malian special forces assisted by counterparts from the US and France had fought their way through the hotel floor by floor, reportedly killing at least two of the gunmen. A security source in Mali said the incident was over by the early evening. At least 30 people escaped during the siege. �쏷he attackers no longer have hostages,�� said a security ministry spokesman, Amadou Sanghou.
A military official said the gunmen shouted �쏛llahu Akbar�� as they began the attack. Al-Mourabitoun, an African jihadi group affiliated with al-Qaida, claimed responsibility in a message posted on Twitter.
A Chinese state-owned company said three of its senior executives were among the dead. China Railway Construction Corp identified the victims as Zhou Tianxiang, general manager for the corporation�셲 international group; Wang Xuanshang, a deputy general manager of the international group; and Chang Xuehui, general manager of the group�셲 west Africa division. China�셲 foreign affairs ministry confirmed the four deaths and said four other Chinese citizens were rescued.
The American victim was named as Anita Ashok Datar, an international aid agency worker from Maryland and former member of the Peace Corp. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, offered �쐂eepest condolences to the families of the deceased and injured��.
Barack Obama, speaking in Malaysia during a regional summit, called it another example of �쏿ppalling�� and �쐀arbaric�� jihadist violence against �쐇nnocent people who had everything to live for��.
�쏷he terrorists began ruthlessly killing people and taking hostages [at the Bamako hotel]. On behalf of the American people I want to extend our deepest condolences to the people of Mali and the victims�� families, including at least one American,�� said the US president.
John Kirby, a US state department spokesman, said about a dozen Americans including embassy staff had been among those rescued at the hotel. Across the city, the Pentagon said, a total of 22 military and civilian employees were accounted for after the attack.
Canada, meanwhile, said a clerk for the federal House of Commons and an employee of Quebec�셲 provincial legislature were both in the hotel at the time of the attacks. Both were safe afterwards.
The attack is a blow to President Ke챦ta, who rushed back from a meeting of regional leaders in Chad. It also marks another reverse for Fran챌ois Hollande, whose country ruled Mali for 68 years until 1960. The French president gained significant political capital from his decision in 2013 to commit French troops to driving Islamist forces out of the north of Mali.
Hollande personally flew out to Timbuktu in February 2013, five days after French forces had routed the occupying jihadists, to hail the operation, saying it had �쐀rought hope to the populations of northern Mali��.
His deployment of 3,700 French ground troops to assist the faltering efforts of Mali�셲 military had been seen as deeply risky, but in the end it took just 23 days for the French to retake most of a swath of territory held for nine months by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim).
Al-Mourabitoun �� which claimed it carried out the hotel attack �� is a more recent incarnation of militant Islamism. Based in northern Mali it is made up mostly of Tuaregs and Arabs and was formed about two years ago.
The attack on the Radisson, one of Bamako�셲 plushest hotels in a neighbourhood also home to government ministries and diplomats, appeared notably brutal, though it remained unclear how many people were killed by the attackers and who might have died when the hotel was stormed by troops.
State television showed footage of soldiers in camouflage fatigues wielding AK-47s in the lobby of the hotel. In the background a body lay under a brown blanket at the bottom of a flight of stairs.
The Radisson�셲 owner, the Rezidor Hotel Group, said 170 guests and staff were initially trapped. Some fled or escaped. Reports said the hostage-takers freed those who were able to quote passages from the Qur�셙n.
Among the released hostages was the Guinean singer S챕kouba �쏝ambino�� Diabat챕, who told reporters he heard some of the attackers in the room next to him speaking to each other in English. �쏧 heard them say in English: �쁃id you load it? Let�셲 go,�쇺�� he said. �쏧 wasn�셳 able to see them because in these kinds of situations it�셲 hard.��
Air France said 12 of its crew who were staying in the hotel were safe. It cancelled its scheduled flights to and from Bamako on Friday. Turkish Airlines had about seven or eight staff staying at the hotel, most of whom were released before the building was retaken.
India�셲 foreign ministry said 20 Indian nationals were among the hostages, and they were all known to be alive. Algeria said seven of its nationals including diplomats had been trapped in the hotel during the siege.
The US Africa Command said forces stationed in Mali helped to secure the scene, and France�셲 national gendarme service said about 40 French special police forces based in Bamako took part in the assault on the hotel.
Ban Ki-moon condemned the �쐆orrific�� attack. His spokesman said the UN secretary general expressed �쐄ull support to the Malian authorities in their fight against terrorist and extremist groups��.
Northern Mali was occupied by rebel fighters, some with links to al-Qaida, for most of 2012. Although they were driven out by the French-led military operation, sporadic violence continues.
In the two and a half years since the French intervention, Mali and its international partners have been working to rebuild, with elections later in 2013 returning Ke챦ta to power. The 70-year-old had previously been president from 1994 to 2000.
This summer, long-running peace talks in Algiers saw agreement between Mali�셲 government and Tuareg-led separatist rebels, which granted greater autonomy to northern regions and aimed to prevent a repeat of the 2012 uprising. But, as with Afghanistan or Iraq, the conflict has never fully gone away, with a variety of armed groups still operating in the north, including jihadi offshoots such as al-Mourabitoun, as well as various separatist organisations.
Recently, the jihadi problem has shown signs of creeping into central and southern Mali. The Radisson attack follows a nearly 24-hour siege and hostage-taking at another hotel in August in the central Malian town of Sevare, in which five UN workers were killed along with four soldiers and four attackers.
Five people, including a French citizen and a Belgian, were killed in an attack at a restaurant in Bamako in March, the first such incident in the capital. Both attacks were also claimed by al-Mourabitoun.
Eight years on, nothing has been learned. In the week since a British soldier was horrifically stabbed to death by London jihadists on the streets of Woolwich, it's July 2005 all over again. David Cameron immediately rushed to set up a task force and vowed to ban "hate clerics". Now the home secretary wants to outlaw "nonviolent extremist" organisations, censor broadcasters and websites and revive plans to put the whole country's phone and web records under surveillance.
"Kneejerk" barely does it justice. As for the impact on Muslims, the backlash has if anything been worse than in 2005, when 52 Londoners were killed by suicide bombers. As the police and a BBC reporter described the alleged killers as of "Muslim appearance" (in other words, non-white), Islamophobic attacks spiked across the country. In the first five days 10 mosques were attacked, culminating in a triple petrol bombing in Grimsby.
As politicians and the media congratulated themselves that Britain was "calmly carrying on as usual", it won't have felt like that to the Muslim woman who had her veil ripped off and was knocked unconscious in Bolton. Nor, presumably, to the family of 75-year-old Mohammed Saleem, stabbed to death in Birmingham in what had all the hallmarks of an Islamophobic attack last month �� or, for that matter, the nearly two-thirds of the population who think there will be a "clash of civilisations" between white Britons and Muslims, up 9% since the Woolwich atrocity.
One key change since 2005 is the rise혻of the violently anti-Muslim English혻Defence League, given a new lease of life by Woolwich. More than 40% of Islamophobic incidents recorded혻by the Muslim organisation Faith Matters last year were linked to the EDL or other far-right groups. "It makes me feel I don't belong here", one Muslim community leader quotes his teenage son as telling him this week.
But almost nobody in public life mentions the war. The reason cited by the alleged Woolwich killers �� the role of British troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and the war on terror �� has been mostly brushed aside as unseemly to discuss. Echoing his predecessors, the prime minister insisted the Woolwich killing was "an attack on the British way of life". London mayor Boris Johnson declared there could be "no question" of blaming British foreign policy or "what British troops do in operations abroad".
Instead, the problem is once again said to be "Islamism", regardless of the string of democratic Islamist governments elected from Turkey to Tunisia. Or the focus is on the "mistakes" of MI5, as if any amount of spooking could detect the determination of an enraged takfiri killer to exact revenge with kitchen knives and meat cleavers. Whatever the focus, even to mention the western wars that drive these attacks is deemed to justify them.
That is, of course, absurd. Targeting a soldier who fought in Afghanistan might not be terrorism in the sense of an indiscriminate attack on civilians. But the random butchery of an unarmed man far from the conflict by disconnected individuals who have nonviolent political alternatives is clearly unjustifiable in any significant religious or political tradition.
The fact that the US declared the war on terror to be a war without national borders and routinely targets unarmed or unidentified victims has fatally blurred those boundaries. The grisly, intimate killing of Lee혻Rigby was the absolute antithesis of high technology drone attacks. But both embody the degradation of the혻human spirit.
There can be no surprise, however, that such attacks take place. It's not just opponents of the war on terror who predicted from the start that it would fuel terrorism not fight it. The intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic did the same. The perpetrators of one attack after another, from London 2005 to Boston 2013, say they're carrying them out in retaliation for the vastly larger scale US and British killing in the Muslim world.
It's true that all kinds of personal factors and experiences help create the혻mentality to carry out such attacks. But as Abdul Haqq Baker �� head of the south London "counter-radicalisation" outfit Street �� puts it, the tipping point that has turned people to violence has been shown again and again to be episodes in the war on terror.
There is already some evidence that torture of one of the Woolwich suspects in Kenya �� after which MI5 tried to recruit him �� may have been such a catalyst. Azad Ali, a Muslim community activist who has advised the Metropolitan police, says there has been a pattern of official abuse of British Muslim activists in Arab countries, apparently using British-supplied intelligence, who are then pressed to work for the British security services when they return home.
What is indisputable is that there were no jihadist attacks in Britain before혻9/11, itself claimed as a response to US support for Arab dictatorships, Israeli occupation and murderous sanctions on Iraq. Wars supposedly fought to keep Britain safe have been shown to do the exact opposite.
Given the bloodshed, torture, mass incarceration and destruction that US-British occupation has inflicted on Afghanistan and Iraq, and the civilian slaughter inflicted in the drone war from Pakistan to Yemen, the only surprise is that there haven't been more terror attacks.
Three years ago WikiLeaks gave a glimpse of the routine killing of Afghan civilians by British troops �� as did the jailing for 18 months of a grenadier guardsman for stabbing an Afghan boy who asked him for chocolate. Now Britain is preparing to supply weapons directly to the Islamist-dominated rebels in Syria. But at home ministers want to use their "Prevent strategy" to freeze out still further nonviolent Islamist groups that have been most effective at isolating those drawn to violence.
Denial of the role of US-British wars, occupations and interventions in the Muslim world in fuelling terror attacks at home helps to get politicians off the hook. But it also plays into the hands of those blaming multiculturalism and migration, feeding racism and Islamophobia in the process. The wars should be ended because they are wrong and a failure �� but also because they fuel terrorism and divide communities.
Those who carried out last week's killing are of course responsible for what they did. But those who have sent British troops to wage war in the Arab and Muslim world for more than a decade must share culpability.
�� Comments on this thread will be premoderated for legal reasons
In the last year, there has been growing unease around the government�셲 Prevent strategy. The UN special rapporteur, along with human rights groups and the government�셲 own independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, have voiced serious concerns. MPs and peers from the joint select committee on human rights have also called for an independent review.
Last summer, the government�셲 counterterrorism policy became a legal duty in schools and nurseries and for childcare providers. With just a few hours of training, a host of public sector workers were now expected to spot people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation, and refer them to the government�셲 deradicalisation programme, Channel.
The controversy around it has been growing as figures for the number of people reported to Channel shoot up. In March it was reported that almost 4,000 people �� triple the number reported the year before �� had been referred to Channel; almost 11 people a day. The Times reported that last year 1,041 children were referred by schools (in 2012 there were only nine).
There have been enough troubling examples to show how widely the net of suspicion is being flung. The four-year-old boy whose nursery teachers were said to have threatened to report him because he mispronounced cucumber as �쐁ooker bomb��. The 14-year-old questioned over his answers in a French class about eco-terrorists. The teenager apparently reported to Channel for his political activism over Palestine. Or more recent claims of a boy questioned over a T-shirt which included the name of a historical Muslim figure.
I have also spoken to parents and community activists who tell more troubling stories; children questioned over stray remarks, attending early morning prayers, starting to wear hijab, or even just having over-active imaginations.
Prevent had a bad reputation even before it was pushed into schools. From its earliest incarnations, there were fears it was a form of mass surveillance of Muslim communities (particularly following the installation of 200 CCTV cameras in a majority Muslim area in Birmingham). Many community groups prefer not to publicise that they receive funds from Prevent because the stigma attached to it is so acute.
The government�셲 own reticence in publishing information about the strategy �� from how success is measured, to what happens to the data of those referred �� only increases suspicion. Many people, from police officers to MPs have agreed that it is a �쐔oxic brand��.
This feeling has become more intense because Prevent now aims to deter people not just from violent extremism but also from �쐍on-violent extremism��. This means not just worrying about people who might be terrorists, but also trying to clock anyone with �쐃xtreme�� views. The government defines these views vaguely, as ideas that are opposed to �쏝ritish values�� �� an equally vague term. As Harriet Harman said in the recent select committee report, the government�셲 policy is focused on the idea that there is �쏿n escalator that starts with religious conservatism and ends with support for violent jihadism��. But this theory has never been proven, and critics point out that it allows the government to label any views they disagree with as a sign of extremism.
The National Union of Teachers has long expressed disquiet over Prevent, saying the duty to report has created a �쐁ulture of suspicion�� in schools. Karon McCarthy, the Prevent officer and assistant principal at Chobham Academy, told the select committee that teachers might be �쐀eing a bit too enthusiastic and feeling very scared that if they do not report something, which is now a duty, they will somehow fall foul of the law��.
More recently, I have worried about the fact that teachers �� however professional, caring, and fair-minded �� are no more immune to the public rhetoric over Islam and terrorism than anyone else. And that rhetoric is increasingly toxic. Last week it was Kelvin Mackenzie, the former editor of the country�셲 then-highest selling newspaper, writing that a Muslim woman in hijab should not be reporting on terror attacks in Nice because of her religion (despite the fact many victims were also Muslim).
Before that, it was the poisonous attempts during the London mayoral elections to smear Sadiq Khan because of his association with an imam who held unsavoury views. The same imam was even slandered as an Islamic State supporter in parliament, despite the fact he had consistently spoken out against the terrorist group.
When the national conversation about Islam and Muslims is so negative, it has a lasting effect. Being Muslim is seen at least as a factor in vulnerability to extremism, so Muslim students become less comfortable discussing controversial issues. Rights Watch UK reported: �쏮uslim children across the United Kingdom are self-censoring for fear of being reported under Prevent. Their fear is not unwarranted. We have uncovered a number of instances where children have been referred to Prevent for legitimately exercising their right to freedom of expression in situations where they pose no threat to society whatsoever.�� Not only does this mean innocent children are being swept up in a panic over extremism, but those who do have disturbing views will not express them. Instead they will be hidden and allowed to fester.
Apart from a few terrifying exceptions, British Muslims want to protect their country and their young people as much as non-Muslims (who also have a few terrifying exceptions). Surveys show they are more patriotic than the wider community, and intelligence from Muslim communities is vital in countering terrorism. But for this to happen, British Muslims need to feel they are partners in keeping the country safe, not just suspects.
At the end of the ninth day of Operation Martyr�셲 Rights in North Sinai, the Egyptian military announced on its official Facebook page that it had killed 55 terrorists, arrested 35 suspects and destroyed 35 houses �� in one day alone.
The operation, billed to the Egyptian public as the decisive battle in the state�셲 ongoing campaign to tackle the country�셲 terrorist groups, has been met with much media fanfare, and to ensure the public is kept up-to-date, the military�셲 spokesman has taken to social media to announce the number of deaths and arrests each day.
In the press, the operation has been declared a sweeping success, and commentators have predicted that domestic terrorism will be �쐁ompletely eradicated�� by the 6 October, to coincide with the anniversary of what is perceived to be Egypt�셲 great 1973 military triumph against Israel.
The operation is just one campaign of many launched by the government in response to the wave of terrorist attacks sparked by the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, in July 2013. The terrorist attacks have included widespread nationwide bombings targeting government buildings and civilians, in addition to the assassination of the prosecutor general in June with a car bomb.
Many of the offensives launched by the national army to tackle terrorist activity have centred on North Sinai, where the terrorist group Sinai Province �� which last year announced allegiance to Islamic State, and has claimed responsibility for most major terrorist attacks in Egypt �� is located.
But for the cities of Rafah and Sheikh Zuwayed,at the heart of the ongoing battle, Operation Martyr�셲 Rights is merely an intensification of the violence they�셶e been caught up in for two years.
For the majority of Egyptians, spurred on by triumphalist news reports, the latest clashes are hoped to put an end to the fear that has been disrupting their lives, but for the people of Sinai, it�셲 a very different story.
Sheikh Zuwayed, a town of 70,000 people just over six miles away from the border area of Sinai, is thought to be one of the key militant strongholds in the peninsula.
For Essam, a community leader there, the last two weeks have been some of the harshest he�셲 ever had to endure. Fear of random shelling is constant �� the last time he had access to electricity was six days ago and running water was cut the day the operation began on 7 September.
Special forces have been conducting exhaustive searches of homes during the day, he explains, while the nights are punctuated by continuous shelling and missile attacks that, according to four residents, strike more civilian homes than terrorist hideouts.
Residents say the violence started to intensify in July, when the government responded to Sinai Province�셲 simultaneous assaults on military strongholds in the town with shelling and ground attacks. More than 100 men died, prompting locals to refer to 1 July as �쏝lack Wednesday��.
A few locals like Ahmed, a resident in his 20s, say that during the clashes they couldn�셳 return to their homes, because the military refused to show them a safe path back as the confrontation continued.
A few locals, like Ahmed, a resident in his 20s, say that after the clashes they couldn�셳 return to their homes until the next day. Even then, the military refused to show them a safe path back at the confrontation continued, he explains.
Ahmed says that the militants�� initial success was mainly because of what the residents refer to as �쐅host fighters��, or what militants call �쐓ubmergers��; suicide attackers, Ahmed explains, who are highly trained in street war tactics and attack alone using heavy weapons to distract the military.
On 1 July, Ahmed recounts that Sinai Province militants enforced a siege of the town for hours before the army�셲 F16 started to attack. It was the first time the fighting had penetrated the city so deeply.
In the days that followed, the military announced several operations targeting militant posts in the city, of which Operation Martyr�셲 Rights is a highlight, at least according to its media coverage.
The Egyptian army last week announced that in 11 days the campaign had left 438 militants dead, and a further 462 arrested.
Reports and military experts have asserted the success of the operation daily, saying that it has left militant groups destabilised and struggling, and that the operation is paving the way for the development of the peninsula.
Essam, however, is skeptical. �쏷hey are bombing us here in the city because they can�셳 come near where we all know terrorists are, deep in the desert.��
Essam says that entire villages that were associated with militants have been effectively taken off the map due to heavy shelling, leaving them completely destroyed and deserted. These include Althouma, Mahdiya, Moqataa, Lofayta and Goura, among others.
�쏷he military considers everyone in the city to be terrorists,�� Essam says. �쏱eople tell [the army] �쁗e don�셳 want you to protect us, we know how to protect ourselves, just don�셳 shoot at our houses��.��
Aside from their experience of warfare, residents say diminishing services have also rendered their lives more difficult.
The main electricity line was hit in the July attacks and blacked out the city completely for 13 days. Water was completely cut too, and has returned only partially more than two weeks later.
Essam adds that some residents pooled funds to buy a generator, due to high demand. However, they could not operate it given the lack of fuel, which has been banned from entering the city since last September, purportedly because terrorists use it for armaments.
�쏝ut what about the other inhabitants of the city?�� asks Essam.
In order to operate the generators, some of the residents drive to Arish, 24 miles away, and smuggle gas back in the city in litre bottles. Others take gas out of their cars.
For now, fleeing has become one of the only options. Essam sees pick-up trucks loaded with people and belongings leaving every day. Some residents estimate that over half of the town�셲 inhabitants have already left, despite military reassurances that they would guarantee the safety of the people sometimes voiced through microphones touring the town.
Ahmed, along with many other residents, finds himself between a rock and a hard place. �쏻hen the military entered Sheikh Zuwayed, we were happy, and we thought they would protect us from the terrorists. But now we�셱e stuck between the two: the terrorists accuse us of dealing with the military and the military says we�셱e all terrorists.��

Illegal wildlife trade worth up to $213 billion dollars a year is funding organised crime, including global terror groups and militias, according to a report by the United Nations and Interpol.
Aside from the well-documented ivory trade of up to around $400m a year that trickles to some militias in East, Central and West Africa, the annual trade of up to $100bn in illegal logging is helping line the pockets of mafia, Islamist extremists and rebel movements, including Somalia's Al-Qaeda linked terror group al-Shabaab that now rely on charcoal as its primary finance.
Christian Hellemann, who led the UN Environment Programme assessment, said the scale of the illegal timber trade "has been totally underestimated and is now being regarded as very significant", beyond concerns over deforestation, destruction of animal habitats and the threats to precious woods such as rosewood, sandalwood and mahogany.
In Africa alone, governments are losing at least $1.9bn a year from charcoal, to the benefit of criminals earning up to $9bn �� three times the value of drug trade on the continent. "This number is likely to triple in the coming decades and we believe that the scale of logging in Africa alone would be equivalent in a few decades from now to what has been logged in the Amazon, just to sustain charcoal trade," said Hellemann.
Al-Shabaab, which last week claimed responsibility for the slaughter of 64 people in attacks on villages near a popular Kenyan coastal resort and the siege in September siege of a upmarket mall in the capital Nairobi that killed around 70 people, earns between $38m and $68m a year from charcoal sales and taxation.
"There is a desperate need for addressing the scale and destinations and routes regarding the charcoal trade," said Hellemann. Charcoal accounts for up to $289m of "threat finance" to organised criminals, terrorists and militias per year, compared to up to $12m in ivory.
Militias in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as the 'janjaweed' fighters on horseback spreading terror across Sudan, Chad and Niger have all profited from the ivory trade, that was once the primary source of funding for the notoriously brutal Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.
UNEP chief Achim Steiner said that over $200bn a year for wildlife crime was "probably an underestimate" and called for a more systematic response that has been used in the fight against arms, people and drug trafficking. "These are not small amounts of money and in fact sustain conflict, enable people to buy arms and ultimately put civil strife and conflict not simply as a localised phenomenon but as parts of a transnational net world that operates across the globe," he said.
Ben Janse van Rensburg, head of enforcement for the the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) said that groups were becoming "increasingly sophisticated" while the illegal trade in wildlife and timber remained "a low-risk, high profit crime."
But an underfunded and uncoordinated international response was sluggish and reactive, with arrests usually limited to petty criminals and poachers and investgations into seized hauls dropped. "We can catch as many foot soldiers as we want. If we don't address the kingpins of illegal trade and wildlife crime, we won't stop it," he said.
"A seizure is not a success. A seizure means a whole lot of animals died and the contraband got seized at the border. We have to track that contraband to the kingpin", said John Scanlon, secretary general of CITES.
Scanlon said that a new breed of ivory traders were driving up prices for between $165m to $199m a year in elephant ivory and $64m to $192m in rhino horn. "We have speculators basically banking on extinction, they have a portfolio" and are "stockpiling [ivory] on the assumption that the value this contraband will go up over time, and it's these speculators that are driving the value of this illegal trade," he said.
Counterterrorism officials believe an alleged al-Qaida terror plot against the UK, designed to cause mass casualties, was due to be carried out within days, the Guardian has learned.
A total of 12 people were arrested across northern England on Wednesday as police carried out a string of raids to thwart an alleged terrorist cell with overseas links.
Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, today confirmed that 11 of those arrested were Pakistani nationals.
A secret briefing note accidentally shown to the media yesterday outside Downing Street by the UK's former top counter-terrorist officer Bob Quick, said 10 of those targeted in the operation were on student visas.
Sources with knowledge of the investigation - in which arrests were rushed forward after Quick's mistake, which today cost him his job - say the execution of an "al-Qaida driven" plot was "imminent".
UK officials say they believe the attack would have been attempted by Easter Monday at the latest.
According to counterterrorism sources, it is unclear where and what the terrorists were targeting.
Officials regularly point out that intelligence is not always conclusive, but today said they believed that the terror plot was highly ambitious and a big attack was being planned.
The source said reports of a northern nightclub or shopping centre being the target were wholly untrue.
As searches continued at addresses across northern England, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, described the suspected plot as "very big" and said investigators were examining links with Pakistan.
"We know there are links between terrorists in Britain and Pakistan, and that is an important issue for us to follow through," he said.
The 12 men were arrested at seven locations across north-west England, and at least another eight addresses in the region were searched.
Scores of students witnessed one arrest, carried out at Liverpool John Moores University. Police said one man was detained near the campus.
"When I looked, I saw a man on the floor," student Daniel Taylor said. "Police were shouting at him and one of the officers had what looked like a machine gun pointed right into his head."
Three men were arrested at Cedar Grove, Liverpool.
"I looked and, about midway down the road, there were a load of police officers dressed in black and they were bringing some men out of a house," a resident said.
Another man was arrested at a flat in Earle Road, also in Liverpool. Police stood guard outside the flat and forensics officers could be seen through net curtains.
Abdul Kassan, 20, who lives next door to the raided flat, was at work in his neighbouring off-licence yesterday when police cars screeched to a halt and officers ran into the building.
"We were working in the shop and the police cars suddenly arrived and police got out with guns," he said.
"We didn't know what was going on - they just told us to shut the shop. It was about 3.30pm. The officers came into the back of the shop.
"The blokes in the flat are new, they've only just moved in, they've all got long beards.
"They bought stuff from us and seemed normal. I think they are Pakistani.
They looked like students and only seemed to speak a little bit of English."
Police also searched a bed and breakfast in Pimlico Road, Clitheroe, today.
More than 100 officers, with a helicopter in support, surrounded the Lancashire town's new Homebase store yesterday and arrested two men working for a private security firm.
The pair were staying at the B&B but had not been there for long and were unknown to neighbours.
The house itself was sealed off and put under police guard as forensic specialists went in and out.
The pair's employer has a security contract with Homebase and they were not directly employed by the DIY chain, which only completed the Clitheroe outlet this week.
A planned opening by the town's mayor in time for the Easter weekend went ahead today and the store was full of shoppers.
The mayor, John Hill, changed his speech to focus on terrorism and community relations in the historic market town.
He said: "I would like to stress that the men arrested are not from Clitheroe.
"We work extremely well together as a community here and [in] the Ribble Valley, and people should carry on regardless of what has happened.
"There is no tension here and we would like it to remain like this."
Hill said terrorism "can happen anywhere" and urged people to "remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police".
Fahy admitted that the operation had been rushed forward as a result of the security blunder by Quick, which exposed plans for the operation to the cameras of press photographers.
However, Fahy added: "The operation would have been carried out in the subsequent 24 hours.
"It got to a point in evaluating what we knew that we had to take action yesterday."
Fahy said reports of Old Trafford or the Trafford shopping centre being the targets were "purely speculation" on the part of the media.
He added that, from what was known at the moment, there was no particular threat to specific locations and "certainly not the ones mentioned in the media".
However, he added that the threat level in the north-west remained high.
England's cricket team will fly home from India tomorrow, but will return in December to take part in the two-match Test series against India. The two fixtures will take place as scheduled, albeit with the second match being moved from Mumbai to an alternate venue in the south of India. The first match is due to start in Ahmedabad on December 11. It is not yet clear when exactly England will return to India or if they will play any warm-up fixtures, such as the one due to begin on December 5 in Baroda.
The England Performance Squad, including Michael Vaughan and Monty Panesar, which had been based in Bangalore but was due to travel to Mumbai in the next two days, will travel home immediately. It is not clear whether they will return to India at any point.
"We want to get back home to a home environment, which we think will be a good thing for all the players," the England team's managing director, Hugh Morris, said. "The players know this is a very real thing because they were only in one of the hotels attacked a few weeks ago." Morris confirmed that no decision had been made about the date of their return. The decision to return home will please the players and their families, who were understood to be anxious about enduring an uncertain two-week waiting period ahead of the first fixture.
"Any country in the world will make sure the priority they have for players and management teams, when at home and overseas, is their safety and security," Morris said. "The Test matches are in place and unless we get security advice to the contrary, we will be playing those Test matches. Sadly we're in extraordinary times, and this won't be the normal build-up to a Test series. But the Test matches stand and we will be prepared to play them."
BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi insisted the decision for England to go home had been reached jointly and confirmed the second Test would be moved away from Mumbai. "There's no difference of opinion at all," he said. "Hugh is absolutely right, the home environment will calm the players down. We are very, very happy the [England] players are going home and will be back. I want to reiterate, we are changing the second Test match. It will take place in another city, but definitely not Mumbai." Modi also confirmed that the two remaining fixtures in England's one-day series against India had not been abandoned but merely postponed, and that they may yet be played at a later date.
The England team stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, one of the centres of the terrorist attack, just two weeks ago and were due to return there on December 16 prior to the final Test three days later. "On behalf of the board and the England team, we would like to express our condolences to the families and friends of those people who were killed or injured in last night's attacks," said Morris. "The safety and security of the England team is of the utmost importance to the ECB. We have reviewed all our security arrangements in the light of these attacks and will be taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the team."
Those sentiments were echoed by Dougie Brown, the chairman of the Professional Cricketers' Association. "The safety of the players is absolutely paramount in this whole thing," Brown said. "The game of cricket is insignificant when people's lives are at threat. We can only judge if someone's life is at threat from what we are seeing and it is not a safe place for visiting cricketing teams to be at the moment. Is this just going to be in Mumbai? Who knows? The main thing is we have to look after the security of our players. Can the safety of our players be guaranteed? On the basis of what we have seen in the last few hours, no."
Reflecting the government's decision to abandon the "aggressive rhetoric" of the so-called war on terror, the guide tells civil servants not to use terms such as Islamist extremism or jihadi-fundamentalist but instead to refer to violent extremism and criminal murderers or thugs to avoid any implication that there is an explicit link between Islam and terrorism.
It warns those engaged in counter-terrorist work that talk of a struggle for values or a battle of ideas is often heard as a "confrontation/clash between civilisations/cultures". Instead it suggests that talking about the idea of shared values works much more effectively.
The guide, which has been passed to the Guardian, is produced by a Home Office research, information and communications unit which was set up last summer to counter al-Qaida propaganda and win hearts and minds.
It shows that the government is adopting a new sophistication in its approach to counter-terrorism, based on the realisation that it must "avoid implying that specific communities are to blame" if it is to enable communities to challenge the ideas of violent extremists robustly. The new lexicon of terror surfaced briefly last month when the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, made a speech on counter-terrorism declaring violent extremism to be "anti-Islamic".
But the internal Home Office guide shows just how far a new official language, to use when talking about terrorism, is being developed. "This is not intended as a definitive list of what not to say but rather to highlight terms which risk being misunderstood and therefore prevent the effective reception of the message," says the Home Office paper. "This is not about political correctness, but effectiveness - evidence shows that people stop listening if they think you are attacking them."
While the leaked Whitehall papers show a new sophistication in the government's approach to talking about terrorism they reveal that their profiling of those most likely to prove vulnerable to violent extremism remains very vague.
They also reveal the crude criteria under which the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, is distributing 짙45m over the next three years for local communities to build resilience to violent extremism.
In the first year the funds will only be distributed to areas with a Muslim population of more than 4,000 based on 2001 census data. "This data is now 6-7 years old and given high population growth in Muslim communities is likely to be fairly out-of-date," says the internal Whitehall correspondence adding that each qualifying local authority will receive a fixed minimum allocation with increments dependent on the size of its Muslim population.
The limitations of this crude population approach suggest there is only a very limited official understanding of the geography of violent extremism in Britain.
Officials admit this approach will mean that six areas currently funded for tackling violent extremism will not meet the criteria from April. That would include, for example, Crawley which was home to three of the five men convicted over the Operation Crevice plot to bomb the Bluewater shopping centre, in Kent, and the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London.
A separate joint Home Office/ Communities Department paper on the strategy to prevent people becoming or supporting violent extremists suggests a disturbingly vague description of those being targeted: "There is no single profile of those most susceptible to these factors but they are likely to be young (generally younger than 30) and male (although the number of women who support and participate in violent extremism is increasing)."
The same paper stresses that "grievances which ideologues are exploiting" to make new recruits should be addressed where they are legitimately based.
It says: "No perceived grievance can justify terrorism. But where concerns are legitimately expressed then we must be prepared to debate them.
"We are committed to better explaining existing policies, such as the UK's foreign policy, refuting claims made about them in the language of violent extremists."
But it adds that where concerns are "legitimately based we must be prepared to address them."
However, it makes clear that this does not mean changes in British foreign policy but using existing programmes to tackle inequalities and unemployment of the Muslim community in Britain.
The "global opportunities fund" and overseas aid programmes would be used to "help address the real grievances of people in key countries overseas which can increase their susceptibility to the extremists' message".
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a bloody wave of bombings and shootings across Paris that left nearly 130 people dead and which the French president, Fran챌ois Hollande, denounced as an �쏿ct of war�� that must be countered �쐌ercilessly��.
Police reported that at least 128 people had been killed and up to 300 more injured �� including 80 critically �� in the six attacks, France�셲 deadliest since the second world war and the worst witnessed in Europe since the 2004 Madrid railway bombings.
Eight militants also died, seven in suicide bombings and one from police gunshot wounds. Police sources told French media that at least one of the fighters, a French national, had been identified by his fingerprints and was known to security services; a Syrian and an Egyptian passport were found close to the bodies of two others, but it was not yet clear that they belonged to the killers.
Isis said it had dispatched the jihadis, wearing suicide bomb belts and carrying machine guns, across the French capital on Friday night in a �쐀lessed attack on... crusader France��. The �쐁arefully selected�� sites and coordinated nature of the attacks were intended, it said, to show that France would remain one of its main targets as long as its present policies continue.
�쏤rance and those who follow her voice must know that they remain the main target of Islamic State and that they will continue to smell the odour of death for having led the crusade, for having dared to insult our prophet, for having boasted of fighting Islam in France and striking Muslims in the caliphate with their planes,�� the group said in a statement.
The Swedish, Belgian and Romanian governments said their citizens were among those who died and there were fears a British man had also lost his life. Frantic friends and relatives mounted a desperate social media search to identify victims, with few details of their identities yet confirmed.
Hollande described the attacks as cowardly and �쏿n act of war�� that had been carefully �쐏repared, organised and planned from outside the country by Islamic State, but with help from inside��. The president added: �쏻e will be merciless toward the barbarians of Islamic State group. Faced with war, the country must take appropriate action.�� But he but did not say what form that action might take.
These were attacks �쏿gainst France, against the values that we defend everywhere in the world, against what we are: a free country that means something to the whole planet��, Hollande said, calling for �쐕nity and courage��. France would observe three days of official mourning, he added.
Under the first national state of emergency to be declared in France since 1961, an extra 1,500 soldiers were mobilised to reinforce police in Paris, Hollande�셲 office said. All Saturday�셲 sports events in the French capital were cancelled, major shops, department stores, museums and tourist sites �� including the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and Disneyland �� stayed closed, and several metro stations were also shut.
No arrests were announced in Paris, and a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor�셲 office, Agn챔s Thibault-Lecuivre, said authorities couldn�셳 rule out the possibility that other militants involved in the attack remained at large. Police said they were were screening hours of CCTV footage from the six locations where the attacks took place.
In southern Germany, the Bavarian state premier, Horst Seehofer, said there was reason to believe that a man arrested last week during a routine motorway check with �쐌any machine guns, revolvers and explosives�� in his car might be linked to the attacks.
Islamic State also released an undated video on Saturday calling on Muslims to continue attacking France. Its foreign media arm, Al-Hayat Media Centre, filmed a number of militants �� apparently French citizens �� sitting cross-legged in an unidentified location and burning their passports.
�쏛s long as you keep bombing you will not live in peace. You will even fear travelling to the market,�� one of the militants, identified as �쏛bu Maryam the Frenchman��, told the camera. Addressing his fellow jihadis, he said: �쏧ndeed, you have been ordered to fight the infidel wherever you find him. What are you waiting for? There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit.��
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said Paris had been targeted because as a city �쐓trengthened by its diversity��, it was �쐕nbearable for fanatics��. �쏷he message we want to give them is that we will be stronger than those who wish to reduce us to silence,�� she said.
As Parisians queued in their hundreds to give blood at a hospital close to a concert hall where the majority of the victims died, a Muslim community leader, Nadir Kahia, said he feared a �쐔sunami of hatred�� against Muslims and residents of the capital�셲 poorer districts.
The carefully orchestrated series of attacks began at 9.20pm outside the Stade de France stadium north of Paris, where three suicide bombers detonated their explosive belts in the course of about 20 minutes. Hollande, who was at a friendly football match between France and Germany at the stadium, had to evacuated by his security guards to the interior ministry.
At about the same time, four gunmen entered a popular concert hall in the capital�셲 north-eastern 11th arrondissement, while others opened fire on a string of cafes and restaurants not far away, crowded on a mild November evening.They came despite France, one of the founding members of the US-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Iraq and Syria, being on a high state of alert for possible terrorist attacks in the run-up to a global climate conference later this month.
The deadliest assault was at the Bataclan, a popular concert hall a few hundred metres from the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine hit along with a Jewish supermarket by Islamist militants in January during a three-day onslaught that left 20 people dead, including three Islamist gunmen.
Witnesses said the militants marched into the venue, where more than 1,000 people had gathered to hear the Californian rock band Eagles of Death Metal, armed with Kalashnikov rifles and shouting �쏛llahu akbar��. At least 87 people lost their lives in the ensuing carnage, and dozens more were taken hostage for nearly three hours until armed riot police stormed the building at about midnight.
�쏷hey didn�셳 stop firing. There was blood everywhere, corpses everywhere. Everyone was trying to flee,�� said Pierre Janaszak, a radio presenter who was at the concert. Other survivors said three of the attackers detonated their suicide belts as the security forces burst in.
Video footage shot from outside the venue showed bodies lying in the street, dozens of people running away from the entrance and survivors pulling the injured to safety. One witness described the scene as a bloodbath.
The other shootings were at bars and restaurants on the Boulevard de Charonne, where 18 people reportedly lost their lives; Boulevard Voltaire, where one person died; Rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi, where five were killed; and Rue Alibert, where 14 were shot dead.
Mark Colclough, a British-Danish psychotherapist, was on the Rue de la Fointaine au Roi in the 11th arrondissement when a gunman opened fire on patrons inside. �쏦e was standing in a shooting position,�� Colclough said.
�쏦e had his right leg forward and he was standing with his left leg back. He was holding up to his left shoulder a long automatic machine gun. It was fully intentional, professional bursts of three or four shots. Everything he was wearing was tight, no zippers or collars. Everything was toned black. A man in military uniform, black jumper, black trousers, black shoes or boots and a machine-gun.��
The slaughter brought immediate international condemnation, with Barack Obama calling it �쏿n attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share��. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she was deeply shaken.
David Cameron said the UK �쐌ust be prepared for a number of British casualties�� from the Paris atrocity and condemned the �쐀rutal and callous murderers��. The Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said his country �쐓hared the sadness and the pain of the French people��. Terrorist crimes �쐁annot be justified��, he said. �쏷he Paris tragedy requires of us all to unite in the fight against extremism, to bring a strong answer to terrorists�� actions.��
Pope Francis also condemned the killings as inhuman acts that left him shaken and pained. �쏷here is no justification for these things,�� he told a Catholic TV station.
The attacks follow a narrowly averted disaster in August, when an Islamist gunman was overpowered on a packed high-speed train in northern France.
All-inclusive package holidays could become more popular as British holidaymakers try and avoid Brexit-related price rises, according to Thomas Cook.
The travel company revealed on Thursday that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss annual profit targets after terrorist attacks in Turkey hit trade.
Thomas Cook reported a 짙25m pretax loss on operations in the three months to 30 June, compared with a 짙3m profit in the same period a year before, after revenues slid 8% to 짙1.85bn. It now expects an annual profit of 짙300m compared with previous forecasts of between 짙310m and 짙335m.
Despite the warning, shares in Thomas Cook rose 6.5% to 63.9p as investors appeared relieved trading was not worse and chief executive Peter Fankhauser suggested Thomas Cook could benefit from a change in holiday habits.
�쏱ackage holidays are already popular but they could become even more popular in this environment, because of the uncertainty on price movement and, in this volatile environment that we are taking care [of holidaymakers] whatever happens at their destination,�� Fankhauser said.
The value of the pound has sunk 12% against the the dollar and 9% against the euro since the UK voted to exit the EU last month, potentially raising the cost of holiday spending money, hotels and travel abroad. But Fankhauser said Thomas Cook had hedged its currency arrangements until next autumn so that its holiday prices would not change. �쏧t doesn�셳 cost people more to go with us,�� he said.
Thomas Cook�셲 bookings from the UK were down 1% in the three months to the end of June, but the company said it expected a strong start to the winter season in the UK, with bookings up by 19% despite Brexit worries.
Analysts at Mintel had predicted more growth in independent city breaks rather than package holidays this year but Fergal McGivney, travel analyst for the market research firm, says any recession might alter the outlook.
With heavy competition for a more limited number of package destinations, as carriers switch away from Turkey and Egypt, prices have come down and more people have already opted to take a charter flight this year. Any recession or drop in the value of the pound is only likely to increase price competition as companies try to persuade families to go abroad rather than opting for a staycation in the UK.
�쏣verything is up in the air following Brexit but if there is a recession it could give package holidays a boost,�� McGivney said. But he said he didn�셳 think the boost would be as strong as the last recession as competition from budget players such easyJet and Ryanair was strong.
In the three months to the end of June, overall bookings at Thomas Cook slid 5% as a jump in travel to Spain and the US failed to offset a drop in holidays to Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, all of which have been hit by terrorist attacks. So far this year bookings to Turkey were down by up to 40% after Thomas Cook cut the number of flights to the country.
The numbers reflected a 41% drop in tourists visiting Turkey in June, revealed by Ankara�셲 tourist ministry on Thursday �� its worst-ever single monthly decline.
Thomas Cook also booked 짙60m less business from Belgium after a bombing at Brussels airport in March disrupted travel and made locals nervous about holidaying abroad.
Thomas Cook said it expected holidaymakers to switch to Spain, Bulgaria, Greece, Cuba and the US as alternatives to Turkey and Egypt.
Fankhauser said: �쏻e are operating in a challenging geopolitical environment, with repeated disruption in some of our key source and destination markets. In addition, while Brexit has had no noticeable impact on our bookings so far, it has added to a general sense of uncertainty �� for our business and our customers alike.��
The widower of a woman killed in a mass shooting in Tunisia has told an inquest he would not have booked the holiday had travel agents told him there was a terror threat in the country.
Giving emotional evidence in person, Jim Windass told the inquests into the deaths of 30 Britons in Sousse on 26 June 2015 that his wife, Claire Windass, was shot dead on his 65th birthday.
Seifeddine Rezgui, a 23-year-old extremist, opened fire on the beach outside the Imperial Marhaba hotel, killing a total of 38 tourists, including Mrs Windass, a 54-year-old care worker and mother-of-two from Hull. Asked by counsel to the inquests Samantha Leek QC what information he received about the security situation in Tunisia or the Foreign Office (FCO) travel advice when booking the trip at a Thomson holidays shop, Windass said �쐍one whatsoever��.
Under cross-examination by Andrew Ritchie QC, who represents 20 of the victims�� families, Windass added: �쏧f someone had told me �쁳here is a possible terrorist situation there�� I would not have booked, end of story.��
Howard Stevens QC, representing Thomson�셲 owner Tui, showed Windass pages from two documents sent to the couple after they booked, which contained links to travel advice pages on the FCO website. Windass told the lawyer: �쏝ecause we had already been [to the hotel] twice before and no one had mentioned anything untoward, we booked it again.��
Windass described his wife�셲 final moments: �쏧�셫 not medical but it was clear that something had happened [to Claire]. There was no pulse. I closed her eyes.��
Last week, the inquests heard evidence from the FCO and Tui, with which all 30 of the Britons killed had booked their holiday.
The court heard claims that Tui travel agents had reassured some of the survivors that Tunisia was 100% safe when they booked their trip to Sousse, despite travel advice warning of a threat from terrorism. It also heard that tour operators working for the firm told embassy officials they did not want �쏿n army of police�� on the streets of Tunisia because it would scare tourists, although they did accept some increase in security was required.
Lawyers representing families of 20 of the Britons who died are to accuse Tui of �쐏ractically hiding and keeping out of the limelight�� FCO warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, according to papers submitted in advance of the resumption of the inquests. Last week, the inquests were shown how Tui customers were able to access the FCO advice via links on booking pages on the firm�셲 website.
Giving evidence, Tui representatives said they did not carry out regular security risk assessments and did not agree security audits were necessary as they were told the advice would not be changing. Earlier in the day�셲 proceedings, the court heard from Allison Heathcote, who played dead between two sunloungers after she had been shot in the stomach and her husband Philip had been killed.
The Heathcotes, from Felixstowe in Suffolk, were staying at the Imperial Marhaba on a holiday to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. In a statement, Mrs Heathcote, who was later put into an induced coma for a month, described the moment she was shot.
�쏧 became aware of being shot in my upper right arm,�� she said. �쏧t was a stinging pain. I was conscious that I had been shot elsewhere on my body but strangely I did not remember bleeding from my injuries and I was not actually aware I had been shot in my abdomen.��
She said fellow holidaymakers were screaming and running away from the scene as she shouted for help. She then heard the sounds of gunshots getting louder as she realised the gunman was returning to the beach. �쏧 was fearing for my life,�� she said. �쏧 lay still on the sand trying not to move in an effort to not draw attention to the fact I was still alive. I realised my best chance of survival was to play dead.��
Heathcote said she was not aware at this stage if her husband had been shot. �쏛t the first opportunity I was asking Phil if he was all right. There was no response from Phil and I realised he had not made it.��
The hearing also heard from the daughter of a couple who were three months away from their 50th wedding anniversary when they were both killed on the beach.
Fighting back tears, Donna Bradley said her parents, Ray and Angie Fisher, did not live to meet their first grandchild, who was born two days before the inquests resumed, to their son Adam and his fiancee.
A former British soldier who saw the Fishers, both from Leicester, on the beach told how he later walked past the gunman after mistaking him for a security guard. Keith Hawkes, who served with the Gurkhas during a 22-year career, said he saw Rezgui with an AK-47 assault rifle and narrowly avoided being shot himself.
In a statement read to the court, Hawkins described security officers who arrived as a mess, saying: �쏷hey looked like anyone off the street, they didn�셳 have any uniforms and one guy must have been 20 stone.�� The inquests previously heard criticism of local law enforcement, who were accused during a Tunisian investigation into the mass killing of deliberately delaying their arrival at the scene to confront Rezgui.
The hearings will continue until the end of February.
A sudden drop in temperature in Melbourne on Monday evening from peaks of 35C brought with it severe thunderstorms and triggered a mass asthma event that left hospitals struggling to treat 8,500 patients.
There is a small group of researchers around the world working to understand the phenomenon known as �쐔hunderstorm asthma��, which although rare, can have devastating consequences. Climate change, they say, may be where part of the blame lies.
On Sunday 20 people remained in hospitals across Victoria, struggling with respiratory and related conditions, while four remained in critical condition. At least six people are known to have died after their asthma was triggered during the thunderstorm, the health department confirmed over the weekend.
A major, state-wide investigation into the response of emergency services to the event has been ordered.
Paramedics did the best they could to respond to an unprecedented 1,900 emergency calls in five hours on the evening of 21 November but were unable to reach everyone in a reasonable time. Ambulances made constant trips to emergency departments that were already overwhelmed as hundreds of patients streamed in under their own steam.
The acting general secretary of Ambulance Employees Australia, Danny Hill, says it would have been a traumatising night for paramedics.
�쏤or anyone who worked that night, from staff on the ground to senior management, they regarded it as the busiest night they ever worked in their whole careers,�� he says.
�쏺ery few crews got fed. They worked 14 hours straight. Everyone worked together, worked hard, and stepped up. There was about 30 people who were so severely ill that they had to be taken straight into intensive care. So you�셱e talking an event equivalent to a bushfire where people are severely burned, or a terrorist attack where people are critically injured.
�쏷hat�셲 the level of chaos our crews dealt with on Monday night.��
Asthma patients can be some of the most difficult for paramedics to respond to. They deteriorate very quickly, and severe cases require more than the immediate treatment a paramedic can provide, including continuous days of intravenous drugs and ventilation. Many, Hill says, went into cardiac arrest.
Kathy Bowlen from St Vincent�셲 hospital says the emergency department there had considered opening a temporary emergency department in the foyer of the hospital to cope with the demand.
While not the first case of thunderstorm asthma in Melbourne, it was the most deadly and the severe. What researchers don�셳 know is why sometimes a combination of high pollen counts and thunderstorms leads to a mass asthma event, while other times, those two factors combined have little impact on people�셲 respiratory health at all. What other factors might be playing a part?
What is known is that grass pollen is usually too big to get into the lungs to cause asthma, and instead causes a reaction in the superficial respiratory systems of those with pollen sensitivity: a hay fever reaction such as a runny nose, sore throat and itchy eyes are more common.
But when a thunderstorm occurs, pollen which had settled during the day can be swept back into the air and the moisture in those winds combined with wind power causes the pollen to rupture into smaller pieces, between 0.5mm and 2.5mm in diameter. Those small fragments are then able to penetrate the superficial respiratory system and get into the lungs, triggering asthma and other serious respiratory responses.
Gennaro D�섲mato is a professor of respiratory medicine in Italy and chairman of the World Allergy Organisation�셲 climate change, biodiversity and allergy committee. He is the world expert on thunderstorm asthma and one of the most published authors on the phenomenon in the scientific literature.
He has been monitoring thunderstorm asthma events throughout the world and says they have also been seen in London in Britain, Naples in Italy, and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.
A sudden and extreme asthma outbreak that occurred in London in June 1994 coincided with a heavy thunderstorm, D�섲mato says. In the space of just 30 hours, 640 patients with asthma or other airway diseases attended London hospitals, nearly 10 times the usual number. For 283 patients, the storm triggered their first known attack of asthma. And for every patient that did seek help, many more suffered at home.
�쏤ortunately, even though it can induce severe asthma, outbreaks associated with thunderstorms are neither frequent nor responsible for a high number of disease exacerbations,�� D�섲mato tells Guardian Australia.
�쏦owever, the mechanisms involved in the release of allergens from pollens during thunderstorm should be known so that patients can receive information about the risk of an asthma attack, including in those usually only affected by seasonal allergic rhinitis [hay fever].��
The frequency of thunderstorms has recently increased in some geographical areas, he says, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates. Research has shown that thunderstorms and their destructive winds are expected to become more severe as the climate changes.
D�섲mato has found a number of characteristics common to all the asthma epidemics. Their occurrence is closely linked to thunderstorms, limited to late spring and summer when there are high levels of airborne pollen grains, and has an onset close to the arrival of the thunderstorm and to major rises in the concentration of pollen grains. People with hay fever and asthma and who stay indoors with windows closed during the thunderstorm are unaffected.
Those not undergoing asthma treatment are at major risk, his research has found. In the Melbourne epidemic on Monday, between 20% and 40% of those affected had never had asthma before, and so would not have been undergoing treatment.
Associate Prof Paul Beggs, an environmental health scientist with Macquarie University in Sydney, is best known for his research on climate change and its impact on allergens such as pollen.
Some research has found that the potency of pollen grains had been increasing, he says. Anthropogenic climate change through the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere could be responsible for this growing pollen potency.
�쏱lants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis,�� he says. �쏧t�셲 like if you change your diet, there are changes in your body. So plants use carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and if you change the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere then their growth conditions are changing.��
�쏛 few smart scientists thought to put these highly allergenic plants into a glass house where we can control all the conditions, from the temperature to light, water and levels of carbon dioxide.��
What they found, he says, is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide leads to a whole range of changes in the plants, including more pollen and more potent pollen.
�쏛ll of these thing are happening in the background: climate change, increasing pollen potency, and they all mean a thunderstorm asthma episode is more likely than it was 20 years ago.��
Beggs is a researcher with the AusPollen Partnership, a multicentre cross-disciplinary team of investigators including eminent allergy physicians and scientists looking at pollen aerobiology and climatology. Their work is essential given Australia is the fourth worst country for allergic hay fever and asthma.
The principal investigator on that team, Associate Prof Janet Davies, says another factor researchers believe may trigger asthma is a sudden temperature change �� which occurred in Melbourne on Monday as the temperature fell rapidly from 35C into the low 20s. But much more research and data is needed to understand the phenomenon, she says.
�쏷he AusPollen Partnership is encouraging people to tell us about their symptoms and triggers, and free app downloads allow people to do this daily if they want to,�� she says.
�쏷hat will help us understand regional patterns and, by integrating that data with geo-spacial data, will help us understand who is at greater risk and the threshold for triggering a higher risk.��
The difficulty for researchers is that pollen monitoring, though extensive in Melbourne, does not go back far enough to help them develop a clear picture of all the factors triggering thunderstorm asthma. This would allow them to issue alerts when they could see a perfect storm of risk factors about to collide.
But Associate Prof Ed Newbigin from the school of biosciences at the University of Melbourne says thunderstorm asthma is going to be �쏿 hard thing to get a handle on�� because of the lack of data.
�쏷he big question is why sometimes high pollen counts combined with thunderstorms sometimes trigger these asthma events and sometimes don�셳,�� he says.
�쏻e need to understand what other factors work together if we want to reduce thunderstorm asthma. Because in Melbourne, high pollen counts and thunderstorms often coincide. But most of the time when they do, nothing happens.��
The leader of a gang accused of plotting to blow up transatlantic planes was applying for a passport for his baby son at the time of his arrest, a court heard today.
Mohammed Said Ali was nine months old when his father, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, was arrested on suspicion of terrorist offences in August 2006.
A fingertip search of the family home in Walthamstow, east London, uncovered passport application documents signed by Ali on behalf of his baby.
Woolwich crown court heard earlier in the trial how a police bug allegedly captured Ali considering whether he should take his children on suicide missions.
"Should I take my lot on? I know my wife wouldn't agree to it, but..." he asked his co-defendant Umar Islam.
Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said such an act might be beyond contemplation for victims of the attack but not those behind it.
Eight men are on trial accused of attempting to smuggle liquid explosives hidden in soft drink bottles onto planes leaving from Heathrow's Terminal 3.
The prosecution says they intended to detonate the planes en route to North America, killing more than 1,500 people.
The court heard today how a cleaner found Ali's damaged passport on the pavement outside his home in August 2006.
Prosecutors claimed he threw away his passport because it contained Pakistani visas before applying for a new one.
The jury heard further evidence of extremist literature and other documents found at Ali's home.
Several books advocating jihad and martyrdom were found in a child's cot in his bedroom. Among them were The Lofty Mountain by Sheikh Abdullah Azzam and Milestones by Sayyid Qutb.
Wright said the first book inspired Osama bin Laden while the author of the second was executed for terrorist offences in Egypt.
Other items found at the flat included an audio recording of a speech by Respect MP George Galloway.
The defendants deny conspiring to murder between January 1 and August 11 2006, and conspiring to commit an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft between the same dates.
The accused are Ali, aka Ahmed Ali Khan, 27, Islam, aka Brian Young, 29, of High Wycombe, Assad Sarwar, 27, of Walton Drive, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire; Tanvir Hussain, 27, of Nottingham Road, Leyton, east London; Mohammed Gulzar, 26, of Priory Road, Barking, east London; Ibrahim Savant, 27, of Denver Road, Stoke Newington, north London; Arafat Waheed Khan, 26, of Farnan Avenue, Walthamstow; and Waheed Zaman, 23, of Queen's Road, Walthamstow.
Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of plotting terrorist attacks in Crimea and claimed two Russian servicemen were killed in clashes this week, as tensions over the peninsula rise to their highest level since Russia annexed it in 2014.
Ukraine denied the alleged incidents had taken place and dismissed the claims as Russian provocation.
In characteristically bellicose language, Putin accused Ukraine of playing a dangerous game.�쓂e obviously will not let such things slide by,�� the Russian president said on Wednesday. Ukraine had �쐒esorted to the practice of terror��, he said.
Putin�셲 warning that Russia would not ignore the incidents will worry observers. The increased tension in Crimea comes at a time when the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine appears to be heating up. There are almost daily casualties on the frontline between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebel military formations, and little sign of a resolution to the conflict, in which more than 9,000 people have been killed over the past two years.
Russia�셲 security service, the FSB, said in a statement that one of its officers had been killed during a shootout with a �쐅roup of diversionaries�� on Saturday night, when they were supposedly discovered just inside Crimea�셲 border with mainland Ukraine. It said the group had 20 homemade devices with a total of 40kg of explosives in their possession.
The FSB said there had been a further incident on Monday involving �쐌assive firing�� from the Ukrainian side of the border and attempts to enter the region by force, during which another Russian soldier died.
�쏰n the night of 8 August 2016, special operations forces from the Ukrainian defence ministry carried out two more attempts to make a breakthrough by sabotage-terrorist groups,�� it said.
The FSB said it had arrested a man named Evgeny Panov, allegedly a Ukrainian military intelligence operative born in 1977, and said he had made a confession. It gave no further information.
�쏷his is a very dangerous game,�� said Putin. �쏻e will of course do everything to assure the security of infrastructure, citizens and will take additional measures to provide security, including serious additional measures.��
The FSB said Kiev�셲 aim was the �쐂estabilisation of the socio-political situation in the region during preparation for elections��. Russia will hold nationwide parliamentary elections on 18 September, with Crimea taking part for the first time since its annexation.
Locals in Crimea have noted a large amount of Russian military hardware on the move in recent days, and the de facto borders between Crimea and Ukraine were closed over the weekend and subject to increased security checks when they reopened.
Ukraine�셲 defence ministry said: �쏷his kind of FSB statement is nothing more than an attempt to justify the relocation and aggressive actions of Russian military units on the temporarily occupied peninsula.
�쏳ussian security services are trying to distract the population of Crimea and the international community from its criminal actions, turning the peninsula into an isolated military base.��
Oleskandr Turchynov, the head of Ukraine�셲 national security and defence council, also dismissed the claims. �쏷he hysterical and false statement by Russia�셲 FSB has no purpose other than an attempt by occupiers to inflame the situation on temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands,�� he said.
Russia annexed Crimea in a swift military operation following the February 2014 revolution in Kiev that deposed the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Armed men in unmarked uniforms fanned out across the peninsula and seized Ukrainian army bases and other key infrastructure. At the time Putin vehemently denied the men were Russian soldiers,but he later admitted they were.
Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in a referendum that the international community dismissed as flawed and illegitimate and which led to western sanctions against Russia that are still in place.
Ukraine has said it will never give up its claim to the peninsula, but it has acknowledged in the past that it does not have the military capability to regain control. Ukrainian authorities have tacitly supported a blockade of Crimea by a group of Crimean Tatars, an indigenous ethnic group largely opposed the annexation. Crimean Tatars blocked trucks from entering Crimea from mainland Ukraine for several months last year and even blew up electricity pipelines, leading to blackouts on the peninsula.Putin has promised infrastructure will be built in the next few years to make Crimea self-sufficient in energy. Moscow is also building a bridge to link the peninsula with the Russian mainland across the Kerch Strait. It is due to open in 2018.
Crimea�셲 governor, Sergey Aksyonov, who was appointed by Moscow, said attempts to destabilise the peninsula during the summer tourist season would be prevented �쐇n the harshest possible way��, promising that the region was safe for residents and tourists.
Igor Plotnitsky, the head of the self-declared Luhansk People�셲 Republic, was admitted to hospital after an assassination attempt this month. He blamed Ukrainian authorities and the CIA, but other analysts suggested infighting or falling out with his Russian handlers was a more likely cause.
Responding to the alleged incidents in Crimea, Putin also said it made no sense to have a �쏯ormandy four�� meeting in the current circumstances. The quartet of leaders from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have met periodically to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine. A meeting had been mooted for the G20 summit in China next month.
The new Stop and Search figures are out today. The data shows that out of all the searches made under Section 44(1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act none resulted in arrests for terrorism offences and less than 1% resulted in arrests for other offences.
We've extracted some of the data for you from the excel document the Home Office published today.
The data for searches made under terrorism legislation is broken down by police force and ethnicity for England and Wales between the financial year 2010-2011.
It shows that most searches made under terrorism legislation were conducted in London by the Metropolitan Police (9,913 out of 11,792).
It also shows that none of the searches made under terrorism legislation in Wales resulted in any arrests, with just 79 of all such searches resulting in arrests for other offences.
Stop and search has always been a controversial area. In January 2009, the Government's anti-terror policy was thrown into turmoil after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that police who use Section 44 without grounds for suspicion are violating individual freedoms and acting illegally.
Until it was repealed in March last year, Section 44 allowed any police force authorised by the home secretary to randomly stop and search any person or vehicle on suspicion of terrorism. Section 47A took its place afterwards.
In addition to terrorism legislation, stops and searches are also performed under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. As Section 1 is the most general, it has recorded the most incidents: no less than 1,205,495 last financial year, or 94.42% of the total searchs.
While searches under Section 1 of PACE can be made by any officer, searches under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 need to have the authorisation of a more senior officer, because they usually involve suspicion of a serious violence. Last year these amounted to 60,180.
Although considerably fewer than the more general Section 1 searches these were still almost six times the searches under terrorism legislation.
Furthermore as the graph below shows, stops and searches made under Section 1 of PACE are at their highest since 2001. Section 60 searches have almost halved compared to the previous year and Section 44 searches are at their lowest since 2001.
Looking at the breakdown by ethnicity of arrests made following these searches, which were not necessarily made under the sections the searches were conducted, almost 5 times more white people were arrested on the whole than black people.
Still if we take individual sections into account, and as the graph below shows, under Section 60 a similar number of arrests were made for both white and black people, while arrests for asians amounted to half of this number; 505, 532 and 204 respectively.
It also needs to be noted that these figures are not proportional with population numbers and thus don't paint an accurate picture of the ethnic breakdown of arrests following stops and searches.
What else would you show with these numbers?

The idea that computers will soon steal our jobs is an article of faith among many of the world�셲 most powerful people. The argument goes like this: breakthroughs in robotics and artificial intelligence will make it possible to automate various kinds of labour. Self-driving cars will replace taxi and truck drivers; software will replace lawyers and accountants. We�셪l end up with a world where machines do almost all of the work.
Over the last few years, a growing chorus of pundits, academics and executives have made this scenario seem inevitable �� and imminent. There are many reasons to be sceptical of their claims. But even if you accept the argument that mass automation is around the corner, you might find yourself wondering what a post-work future would look like. Would it be a heaven or a hell, or somewhere in between?
Peter Frase gives four answers to this question in Four Futures: Life After Capitalism. He offers two heavens and two hells: two ways that automation might facilitate a flourishing of human life, and two ways that it might maximise human misery. In all of these potential futures, automation is the constant; what changes is the political and ecological context �� in other words, who owns the robots and how혻climate change affects the resources on which technology depends.
Frase�셲 approach stands in stark contrast to other practitioners of the genre. Many mainstream futurists predict that automation will mean lives of leisure for all, as we�셱e liberated from our day jobs to become artists or artisans or lotus-eaters. Perhaps, Frase responds, but technology doesn�셳 dictate outcomes. Rather, it sets the parameters of possibility. Utopia is an option, but the robots alone won�셳 get us there. That�셲 because the distinctly dystopian features of our present �� a small number of people control most of the wealth, and global warming is heating portions of the planet past habitable levels �� won�셳 simply disappear with automation. The day after the robots arrive, Frase points out, capitalist class relations and a collapsing biosphere will still be with us.
This might seem obvious, but it�셲 infuriatingly absent from much forecasting. Frase injects a sorely needed dose of reality to the conversation, and the result is invigorating. In the tradition of the finest science fiction, his futures feel plausible because they�셱e intensified versions of our present. They�셱e not narrowly predictive, but roaming, impressionistic �� �쐓ocial science fiction��, he calls it, a mode of speculative analysis that reads like Philip K Dick ventriloquising Marx.
The first of the book�셲 four futures is혻�쐁ommunism��, a word that Frase restores to its original meaning. For Marx, communism meant not an authoritarian one-party state but the idyll that awaits us after a long period of social and technological transformation. A communist society is so productive and so egalitarian that nobody has to work to survive, fulfilling Marx�셲 famous dictum, �쐄rom each according to his ability, to each according to his need��. For Frase, this ideal might be realised by robots running on an unlimited clean energy source, providing the혻material basis for a post-work, post�몊carcity and post-carbon world.
Just because the technical preconditions for such a world exist doesn�셳 mean it�셪l magically materialise, however. This is the central argument of Frase�셲 book: building the future we want is ultimately a matter of politics, not technology. As he points out, economic elites will surely want to preserve their privileges even if a system of wage labour is �쐔otally superfluous�� for production. �쏦aving power over others is, for many powerful people, its own reward,�� he writes. And if these people manage to retain their dominance in a fully automated economy, then we get �쐒entism�� �� Frase�셲 second future.
Rentism is where abundance exists, but �쐔he techniques to produce abundance are monopolised by a small elite��. This monopoly is maintained by owning not merely the robots, but the data that혻tells the robots how to do their job. A혻world where you can automate everything is a world where you can encode any task as information. You might have a very sophisticated robot, but you�셪l still need to give the robot software that explains how to make pancakes or plunge your toilet. This software can be copyrighted as intellectual property, so that whenever you need your toilet plunged, you have to pay a fee.
That means you�셪l also need a job. The only problem is that there aren�셳 enough jobs, because all the socially useful work is done by machines. That leaves the labour required to sustain the ruling regime: you could be one of the lucky few who gets to write the software, or an intellectual property lawyer who protects it from infringement, or a cop who disciplines the large numbers of desperate people who are too poor to pay for it. But mostly, rentism will be혻prone to underemployment and stagnation, because the economy requires consumers and the jobless masses can�셳 afford to consume.
As unpleasant as it sounds, rentism still contains a kernel of utopia, because it presupposes a form of abundant clean energy. But what if that miraculous energy source never arrives? What if there�셲 no escape from scarcity or the ecological horrors of climate change?
Climate change is often framed as a crisis for the human race as a whole. But혻as Frase explains, this apocalyptic rhetoric obscures the essential fact that climate change affects different groups of people differently. Those who live in less vulnerable latitudes, or who can afford to insulate themselves from extreme heat and weather, will fare much better than the poorer residents of Dhaka or Miami or the Maldives. The question isn�셳 whether human civilisation will survive �� it almost certainly will �� but �쐗ho will survive the change��.
If we find a way to survive it in �쐓ome reasonably egalitarian way��, our society might resemble �쐓ocialism��, Frase�셲 third future. In socialism, there are no shortcuts. Automation exists, but the breakthrough that creates a cornucopia of carbonless energy doesn�셳. This means we have to cool the climate the old-fashioned way, through a massive, state-led campaign to radically remake our infrastructure, our landscape and our patterns of consumption. Frase offers some thoughtful proposals on how to organise such an undertaking fairly and efficiently, through mechanisms such as a universal basic income, paired with market planning. But one혻can�셳 help feeling that this future, while decent and democratic, sounds rather boring when compared with its communist cousin.
There are far worse things than boredom, however. Frase�셲 fourth and final future, �쐃xterminism��, is truly terrifying. Exterminism has the robots and scarcity of socialism, minus the egalitarianism. The result is a neo-feudal nightmare: the rich retreat to heavily fortified enclaves where the robots do all the work, and everyone else is trapped outside in the hot, soggy hell of혻a rapidly warming planet. �쏷he great danger posed by the automation of production, in the context of a world of혻hierarchy and scarce resources,�� Frase says, �쐇s that it makes the great mass of혻people superfluous from the standpoint of the ruling elite.�� The elite can always warehouse this surplus humanity in prisons and refugee camps. But at a certain point, the rich might find it more convenient to simply exterminate the poor altogether, now that they�셱e no longer needed as workers.
It is a testament both to Frase�셲 ability as a writer and the barbarism of our present moment that exterminism feels like the most realistic of his futures. I lost sleep over it. Yet he is혻careful to counsel his readers against despair. �쏷he ruling class tells us that the future is inevitably bright; left-leaning curmudgeons reassure themselves that the future is inevitably gloomy,�� he writes. But the future is neither bright nor gloomy: it�셲 what we make of it. Between the temptations of nihilism and utopianism lies politics, with its rhythms of long, slow struggle punctuated by the occasional social explosion. It may not provide the thrill of pretending to know the future, but it�셲 the only force capable of creating a혻world we might want to live in.

The ruling by an 8-1 majority held that the indefinite detention without trial at Belmarsh, and Woodhill high security prisons was unlawful under the European convention on human rights (ECHR).
Constitutional lawyers called it one of the most important decisions from Britain's highest court in 50 years.
But 24 hours after David Blunkett, the law's sponsor, was forced to resign as home secretary, Downing St and the new home secretary, Charles Clarke decided to tough it out. They would study the judgment - but made it plain they are more likely to renew the controversial laws than modify them.
Lord Hoffmann, ruled that there is no "state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation"- the only basis on which Britain is entitled to exercise its opt-out from article five of the European convention, the right to liberty.
It was the anti-terror laws introduced by Mr Blunkett which posed a threat, he declared. "The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."
The judgment adds to the clutch of election-sensitive law and order problems in Mr Clarke's in-tray. No 10 signalled it is "clearly minded to renew it" and Mr Clarke chose to stress continuity with Mr Blunkett's policies.
On Channel 4 News Hazel Blears, the police minister, said judges who authorised detentions had seen intelligence data which the law lords did not. "This is a matter for parliament to decide" in line with the European convention. "Our over-riding concern is the protection of this nation."
Sixteen Muslims have been detained under the anti-terror legislation, with 10 still held in Belmarsh, south-east London, and Woodhill, Bucks, and one in Broadmoor mental hospital. They are certified as "suspected international terrorists".
The law lords ruling said the state should decide whether a state of emergency existed. But they argued that the government's response breached the human rights convention because it went further than required.
It was a disproportionate interference with liberty and equality and unlawfully discriminated against foreigners because British terror suspects thought to pose a similar risk cannot be locked up without charge or trial.
Lord Scott described the regime under which suspects can be detained indefinitely on the say-so of the home secretary with no right to know the grounds for detention as "the stuff of nightmares, associated with France before and during the revolution, with Soviet Russia in the Stalinist era, and now associated, as a result of section 23 of the 2001 Act, with the United Kingdom".
The judgment does not oblige the government to release the detainees immediately, but under the Human Rights Act the government must take steps soon to remedy the situation. These could include legislation - for example, making evidence obtained from telephone tapping admissible in a criminal court - which would make it easier to try detainees.
Another option would be measures allowing them to be released under constant surveillance and monitoring.
Mr Clarke is expected to produce new proposals in the new year and until then the detainees will remain in Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons.
Gareth Peirce, solicitor for eight detainees, commented: "The government has to take steps to withdraw the legislation and release the detainees."
The judgment puts Mr Clark under huge pressure to devise a solution or face the prospect of more embarrassing court defeats in the run-up to the general election.
The detainees' solicitors could take the case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if the government drags its heels. Lawyers said another possibility was an application in the English courts for a declaration that it was unconstitutional for the home secretary to continue to detain the men in breach of a house of lords ruling.
The case was heard by an al most unprecedented panel of nine law lords, instead of the usual five, because of its constitutional significance.
The attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, who argued the case for the government, had tried to persuade the judges that they were "undemocratic" and should defer to the will of elected representatives.
Jeffrey Jowell, professor of public law at University College London, said: "It establishes that, even where the government claims national security is an issue, the court has authority to delineate the proper boundaries of a rights-based democracy."
Last Sunday I was forced on to a flight to Singapore by four border officers without warning. They gave me just minutes to say goodbye to the family and life I have built over decades.
My husband, John, who I help care for, is a British citizen. I have British children and a grandchild. If I can be taken away from my home in a County Durham village to a detention centre in Scotland overnight, and then spirited out of the country on a Sunday when there was no access to legal advice, what chance does anyone else have?
The authorities have shown their willingness to treat foreign-born people as second-class citizens, no matter how integrated we are �� and, worse, treat us like criminals. I was not allowed a camera phone in the detention centre, presumably in case I photographed conditions there.
During my removal from Britain I was treated like a terrorist: I was restrained by the arms, my every word written down, and there were guards on the door when I went to the toilet. This happened in full view of the public in Edinburgh airport,and was deeply humiliating. The border authorities even claimed that I �� a woman on my own �� posed a risk of violence. And they ticked a form to note the media interest and public sympathy in my case, as if I was to be punished for speaking out.
When I arrived in Singapore I was given a number for people who were supposed to be able to help, but they were in Thailand. I was told I would be met at the airport by someone who would assist with accommodation and settlement �� this never happened. During all this time, my family back home were being put through confusion and distress that they never deserved.
Everything that took place last weekend was the latest step in a long story of an immigration system that provides no adequate support to claimants, and does its best to treat honest people like liars and thieves. For some time now, I have filled out long and complex application forms repeatedly, only to be told that I have been given the wrong form or that the application is invalid for some technical reason.
I have received more support than many in my position. Lawyers, members of parliament and others have intervened on my behalf, albeit unsuccessfully so far. But my case is not peculiar. Families in Britain are routinely broken up. One immigration solicitor says he comes across similar cases roughly twice a week.
Staff at Migrant Voice, who raise the profile of migrants in the press and have helped publicise my story, find themselves overwhelmed with stories of honest people trying to make a life who have been met with injustice and treated with contempt.
The Home Office�셲 legal position seems to be that it is in the public interest to override my right to a family life. Yet from the British public I have received nothing but sympathy and kindness. Messages of support have flooded in from people I have never met. The appeal set up on my behalf has now raised over 짙50,000, more than double its initial target. This is invaluable �� I was forced out with just 짙12 in my pocket. And I am lucky to have access to a secure roof over my head, thanks to my sister, who has three children and is currently sleeping on the sofa. I would certainly not have been able to afford the costs of legal advice otherwise.
However, thanks to the compassion and generosity of my own community in the north-east and people across Britain, I still stand a fighting chance of coming home. I am hoping to lodge an appeal against my deportation, which I believe has been conducted secretly, inappropriately and with little due process.
Above all, I would appeal to all those who have made �쐌igrant�� a term of abuse to think about the human cost of their actions. Wanting to build a life and a family, and to be around people and places that you love, is not a crime.
Lawyers and intelligence experts with direct knowledge of two intercepted terrorist plots that the Obama administration says confirm the value of the NSA's vast data-mining activities have questioned whether the surveillance sweeps played a significant role, if any, in foiling the attacks.
The defence of the controversial data collection operations, highlighted in a series of Guardian disclosures over the past week, has been led by Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, and her equivalent in the House, Mike Rogers. The two politicians have attempted to justify the NSA's use of vast data sweeps such as Prism and Boundless Informant by pointing to the arrests and convictions of would-be New York subway bomber Najibullah Zazi in 2009 and David Headley, who is serving a 35-year prison sentence for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
Rogers told ABC's This Week that the NSA's bulk monitoring of phone calls and internet contacts was central to intercepting the plotters. "I can tell you, in the Zazi case in New York, it's exactly the programme that was used," he said.
A similar point was made in anonymous briefings by administration officials to the New York Times and Reuters.
But court documents lodged in the US and UK, as well as interviews with involved parties, suggest that data-mining through Prism and other NSA programmes played a relatively minor role in the interception of the two plots. Conventional surveillance techniques, in both cases including old-fashioned tip-offs from intelligence services in Britain, appear to have initiated the investigations.
In the case of Zazi, an Afghan American who planned to attack the New York subway, the breakthrough appears to have come from Operation Pathway, a British investigation into a suspected terrorism cell in the north-west of England in 2009. That investigation discovered that one of the members of the cell had been in contact with an al-Qaida associate in Pakistan via the email address sana_pakhtana@yahoo.com.
British newspaper reports at the time of Zazi's arrest said that UK intelligence passed on the email address to the US. The same email address, as Buzzfeed has pointed out, was cited in Zazi's 2011 trial as a crucial piece of evidence. Zazi, the court heard, wrote to sana_pakhtana@yahoo.com asking in coded language for the precise quantities to use to make up a bomb.
Eric Jurgenson, an FBI agent involved in investigating Zazi once the link to the Pakistani email address was made, told the court: "My office was in receipt �� I was notified, I should say. My office was in receipt of several email messages, email communications. Those email communications, several of them resolved to an individual living in Colorado."
Michael Dowling, a Denver-based attorney who acted as Zazi's defence counsel, said the full picture remained unclear as Zazi pleaded guilty before all details of the investigation were made public. But the lawyer said he was sceptical that mass data sweeps could explain what led law enforcement to Zazi.
"The government says that it does not monitor content of these communications in its data collection. So I find it hard to believe that this would have uncovered Zazi's contacts with a known terrorist in Pakistan," Dowling said.
Further scepticism has been expressed by David Davis, a former British foreign office minister who described the citing of the Zazi case as an example of the merits of data-mining as "misleading" and "an illusion". Davis pointed out that Operation Pathway was prematurely aborted in April 2009 after Bob Quick, then the UK's most senior counter-terrorism police officer, was pictured walking into Downing Street with top secret documents containing details of the operation in full view of cameras.
The collapse of the operation, and arrests of suspects that hurriedly followed, came five months before Zazi was arrested in September 2009. "That was the operation that led to the initial data links to Zazi �� they put the clues in the database which gave them the connections," Davis said.
Davis said that the discovery of the sana_pakhtana@yahoo.com email �� and in turn the link to Zazi �� had been made by traditional investigative work in the UK. He said the clue-driven nature of the inquiry was significant, as it was propelled by detectives operating on the basis of court-issued warrants.
"You can't make this grand sweeping [data collection] stuff subject to warrants. What judge would give you a warrant if you say you want to comb through vast quantities of data?"
Legal documents lodged with a federal court in New York's eastern district shortly after Zazi's arrest show that US counter-intelligence officials had been keeping watch over him under targeted surveillance with the warranted approval of the special intelligence court. During the course of the prosecution, the US served notice that it would be offering evidence "obtained and derived from electronic surveillance and physical search conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (Fisa)."
Feinstein and Rogers have also pointed to the case of David Headley, who in January was sentenced to 35 years in jail for having made multiple scouting missions to Mumbai ahead of the 2008 terrorist attacks that killed 168 people. Yet the evidence in his case also points towards a British tip-off as the inspiration behind the US interception of him.
In July 2009, British intelligence began tracking Headley, a Pakistani American from Chicago, who was then plotting to attack Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in retaliation for its publication of cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Information was passed to the FBI and he was thereafter, until his arrest that October, kept under targeted US surveillance.
An intelligence expert and former CIA operative, who asked to remain anonymous because he had been directly involved in the Headley case, was derisive about the claim that data-mining sweeps by the NSA were key to the investigation. "That's nonsense. It played no role at all in the Headley case. That's not the way it happened at all," he said.
The intelligence expert said that it was a far more ordinary lead that ensnared Headley. British investigators spotted him when he contacted an informant.
The Headley case is a peculiar choice for the administration to highlight as an example of the virtues of data-mining. The fact that the Mumbai attacks occurred, with such devastating effect, in itself suggests that the NSA's secret programmes were limited in their value as he was captured only after the event.
Headley was also subject to a plethora of more conventionally obtained intelligence that questions the central role claimed for the NSA's data sweeps behind his arrest. In a long profile of Headley, the investigative website ProPublica pointed out that he had been an informant working for the Drug Enforcement Administration perhaps as recently as 2005. There are suggestions that he might have then worked in some capacity for the FBI or CIA.
Headley was also, ProPublica found, the subject of several inquiries by agents of the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force. A year before the Mumbai attacks his then wife, Faiza Outalha, reported on him to the US embassy Islamabad, saying he was on a secret mission in India and was a "drug dealer, terrorist and spy".
A US terror alert issued this week about al-Qaida plots to attack targets in western Europe was politically motivated and not based on credible new information, senior Pakistani diplomats and European intelligence officials have told the Guardian.
The non-specific US warning, which despite its vagueness led Britain, France and other countries to raise their overseas terror alert levels, was an attempt to justify a recent escalation in US drone and helicopter attacks inside Pakistan that have "set the country on fire", said Wajid Shamsul Hasan, the high commissioner to Britain.
Hasan, a veteran diplomat who is close to Pakistan's president, suggested the Obama administration was playing politics with the terror threat before next month's midterm congressional elections, in which the Republicans are expected to make big gains.
He also claimed President Obama was reacting to pressure to demonstrate that his Afghan war strategy and this year's troop surge, which are unpopular with the American public, were necessary.
"I will not deny the fact that there may be internal political dynamics, including the forthcoming midterm American elections. If the Americans have definite information about terrorists and al-Qaida people, we should be provided [with] that and we could go after them ourselves," Hasan said.
"Such reports are a mixture of frustrations, ineptitude and lack of appreciation of ground realities. Any attempt to infringe the sovereignty of Pakistan would not bring about stability in Afghanistan, which is presumably the primary objective of the American and Nato forces."
Dismissing claims of a developed, co-ordinated plot aimed at Britain, France and Germany, European intelligence officials also pointed the finger at the US, and specifically at the White House. "To stitch together [the terror plot claims] in a seamless narrative is nonsensical," said one well-placed official.
While Abdul Jabbar, a Briton, and others killed by an American drone strike on 8 September in North Waziristan, in Pakistan's tribal areas, were heard discussing co-ordinated plots, including possible "commando-style" attacks on prominent buildings and tourist sites in European capitals, security and intelligence officials said the plots were nowhere near fruition.
The officials did not deny the men, and other foreign-born jihadi recruits who travel to the tribal areas for indoctrination and training, represented a potentially serious threat. "You have discussions about all sorts of things �� that does not necessarily mean there is anything concrete. It is not easy to set up groups," said one counter-terrorism official.
By making it clear that the US drone strikes were pre-emptive, and were not in any way combating an imminent threat, European officials raised fresh questions �� this time directly involving a British national �� about the legality of the attacks, which could be viewed as assassinations.
They said Washington was the "driver" behind claims about a series of "commando-style" plots and that the CIA �� perhaps because it was worried about provoking unwelcome attention to its drone strikes �� was also extremely annoyed by the publicity given to them.
The plot claims, which western intelligence agencies were aware of for months, were leaked last week to the American media.
They were followed by a spate of what security and intelligence officials said were exaggerated claims in the British media, a US state department warning to American citizens to be vigilant when visiting Britain, France, and Germany, a "tit for tat" warning by France to its citizens visiting the UK, and alerts issued by the Swedish and Japanese governments.
Thomas de Maizi챔re, Germany's interior minister, publicly expressed his scepticism about the US terror warning, saying he saw no sign of an imminent attack on Germany. He described the danger to Germany as "hypothetical".
The sharp rise in US unmanned drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal areas, coupled with several cross-border raids by American helicopter gunships that culminated in the killing of two Frontier Corps soldiers last week, was destabilising Pakistan, Hasan said.
"Why are they putting so much pressure on us? It is a threat to the democratic system �� But people in Pakistan feel Washington does not care." American actions were "obviously" linked to Obama's decision to set a timetable for leaving Afghanistan. The US leader had "jumped the gun" and now "the Americans are in a hurry".
He said fears were growing in Pakistan that the US was planning a bombing campaign using fixed-wing aircraft as well as drones in North Waziristan.
Hasan said Washington politicians failed to understand how much the US needed Pakistan in the "war on terror". Nor did they realise that public anger over repeated US infringements of Pakistani sovereignty could boil over into attacks on American personnel and interests that the government might not be able to control.
"The government does not want to go down this road," he said. "But people feel abused. If they [the Americans] kill someone again, they will react. There is a figure that there are 3,000 American personnel in Pakistan. They would be very easy targets."
Hasan said American personnel stationed at the Pakistani air force base at Jacobabad, on the border between Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, could be vulnerable if the situation deteriorated further. The US requested the use of Jacobabad, and other bases at Dalbandin and Pasni, after the 9/11 attacks, and has maintained a military presence there ever since.
Another Pakistani diplomat said Jacobabad was the main centre of operations for CIA and US army drones, which are ultimately controlled from America. "They have hangars there. That's where they fly from and that's where they return."
The drone operations began in June 2004 with the tacit, reluctant agreement and involvement of the Pakistani authorities but were now in effect running beyond Pakistan's control, the diplomat suggested. "We have always denied it in the past. But everybody knows this is happening. We need to wake up," the official said.
A US official said: "Our allies have been briefed on the nature of the threat and the intelligence that led to the travel alert and everyone understands this cannot be taken lightly.
"To try to ascribe any political motivation is misguided and irresponsible."
Abu Qatadah, a German-born Muslim convert, who has brokered our visit to the Islamic State, is almost as wide as he is tall, with a thick, reddish-brown beard. My photographer son Frederic and I load our bags into the bed of the white pickup Qatadah and his driver arrived in. The driver�셲 head and face are so thoroughly wrapped with a large grey shawl that only his eyes and the contours of his nose are visible. He murmurs a greeting in English in a strikingly rhythmic accent. For security reasons, we can�셳 use the main roads. The drive to Raqqa takes more than three hours.
Qatadah claims business is booming in Isis. Almost all the shops are open and lots of goods are being sold, above all at the markets. We notice the new construction. �쏧n places that are not being bombed, life goes on as normal,�� Qatadah tells us. Then he gives us a short lecture on Isis�셲 version of sharia.
For theft of goods worth more than $40 (짙28), a hand is cut off. $40 is the price of a gram of gold.
Christians have to pay jizya, a protection tax. It comes to about $300 (짙210) a year for poor people and $600 (짙420) for the rich. But then that is the only tax. Christians are among the more prosperous inhabitants of the country. All they have to do is sell a couple of sheep to raise the money to cover the tax.
Muslims pay a zakat, or religious tax, based on their assets. Rich Muslims pay more tax than Christians. Poor ones pay less. The money is used for social programmes. In Raqqa, for example, Isis runs three hospitals.
At the moment, Isis finances itself mostly through assets seized in war, sales of oil and the zakat. In reality, Qatadah claims, there are no slave markets the way we imagine them. Slaves are part of the spoils of war and therefore either go to the fighters or are sold. A Yazidi woman is worth about $1,500 (짙1,050) at the moment. About the same price as a Kalashnikov.
It is already dark when we arrive in Raqqa. We drive by a circular plaza we recognise from media reports. It�셲 surrounded by an iron fence. This is where the heads of decapitated enemies are impaled and put on display. I had imagined the eerie plaza to be much larger. Frederic is not allowed to take any photographs �� the decision of the masked driver, who evidently has a lot of say.
Frederic asks what they did with the bodies of the hostages they killed; James Foley and all the others. �쏷hey were buried individually, or rather, tossed into the ground. Somewhere,�� Qatadah answers impassively.
Tomorrow we�셱e supposed to be going to Mosul. Because our iPhones have built-in GPS systems that cannot be disabled, they would pose a security risk. Therefore, the phones are going to stay here. We won�셳 be able to retrieve them until we leave.
Qatadah explains that, at the end of our journey, all our video and photo files will be reviewed. That�셲 normal procedure in war.
We look grim. That was not what we agreed to. We try to negotiate a compromise. But our driver, still completely disguised �� and who clearly has more authority than we first realised �� repeats the requirement emphatically, and with stinging coldness. Then, jutting his head forward, he looks us in the eye and asks if we finally understand. His right eyelid seems to droop a little.
An icy silence fills the room. The tone and atmosphere have suddenly changed. Qatadah seems to find the whole situation rather uncomfortable.
Our request to report freely without any censorship has been categorically denied by Qatadah�셲 superiors. The security risk is too high. A drone only needs a single photograph of an individual to be able to target that person and kill him.
Qatadah tells us we�셱e no longer allowed to go out and about in Raqqa. We have to stay in the apartment until we leave for Mosul. I ask if before we leave we can at least see the British hostage, the journalist John Cantlie, or the famous executioner Jihadi John. Qatadah�셲 answer is a resounding �쐍o��.
Abu Loth �� a wiry fighter who looks about 25, also German, with Moroccan roots �� appears along with our English �쐂river��, whose face is still hidden. The driver immediately takes charge of the conversation. Basically, he doesn�셳 trust journalists, and if we don�셳 want to accept that, then we can go. �쏡o you think it�셲 smart to let somebody come, someone you don�셳 know, to invite him to your state, the state everybody is fighting against? And then you don�셳 control him?��
He suggests a compromise. On this trip, he�셪l show us a couple of things we want to see. If we prove ourselves to be trustworthy, we are welcome to come back and visit another time. Then all restrictions would be lifted. As it is, we have already achieved a great deal and can count ourselves lucky. We are the first non-Muslim journalists to come here without having our heads cut off.
Why are we so interested in this �쏪ihadi John, as you call him��, and Cantlie, the masked one wants to know. Why aren�셳 we interested in Muslims who are suffering in this country?
Despite his protestations, the theme of Cantlie seems to interest him. He leaves to speak with his superiors again to find out if we might be able to visit Raqqa after all, and whether a meeting with Cantlie might be possible, even without cameras. Our visit has been arranged by the central media department and by the caliph�셲 office. So no one wants to take any chances.
When Qatadah and the driver return, both look extremely sullen. Have their proposals been rejected? The driver sits down again on the armchair across from me. �쏮osul or Turkey. That�셲 it,�� he snaps disagreeably. And he sticks by his original proposal in the matter of Cantlie. I am mystified. He needs to treat us with more respect, I say.
The masked man ups the stakes. There will be restrictions in Mosul as well. I tell him calmly that the ban on leaving the apartment is completely unacceptable. Such a thing has never happened to me, not even when I visited the Taliban. �쏻e aren�셳 the Taliban,�� the masked man snarls. The only part of his face that is visible is that one eye with the half-closed lid. Meanwhile, Frederic is staring at the Englishman with a horrified look on his face.
I take the invitation from the caliph out of my pocket and say: �쏽ou gave us a formal invitation filled with grand words. Instead, you�셱e treating us like prisoners.��
�쏽ou are not prisoners,�� the masked man yells in his rhythmic accent. �쏱risoners don�셳 get to choose what they want for breakfast.��
�쏞hange your tone right now,�� I yell so loudly that he jumps.
The way he�셲 looking at us, there�셲 nothing he�셝 like better than to cut off our heads.
We try to extricate ourselves from this conflict without losing too much face and most importantly to return to a position where we can negotiate. So I tell the Englishman as calmly as I can that we are now going to return to our room to decide whether we wish to drive on to Mosul or turn back.
If we end the journey now, there�셲 a good chance Isis will change their minds and see a greater advantage in kidnapping or beheading us. That would be no worse loss of face for them than if, on our return, we describe how Isis�셲 word isn�셳 worth the paper it�셲 written on. It�셲 all too complicated for me. I don�셳 want to break off the journey because of a breach of etiquette. Apart from that, film and photos are also censored by western states in war zones for security reasons. We decide to continue with the journey, but to insist on changing the tone of our exchanges.
After a while, Qatadah comes into our room and asks if he can bring us anything. He obviously wants to smooth things over.
When he leaves, Frederic sits down next to me, white as a sheet. He whispers: �쏧�셫 not absolutely sure because I can�셳 check without my computer, but I think the masked Englishman is Jihadi John.��
We sit together in silence for a long time, just looking at one another.
We have travelled in a small minibus to Mosul, in the heart of Isis. Five thousand Isis fighters control this city, which once had a population of two million. Fewer than 400 men were all it took to rout more than two divisions of Iraqi soldiers, 20,000 of them. Qatadah tells us it was only 183 men.
Mosul looks normal to us, just like other big cities in the Middle East �� vibrant, with lots of traffic and countless people on the street. Did we just drive by an Isis traffic cop? I�셫 not sure, but that�셲 what it looked like.
Of course, as I look around, I don�셳 forget that countless Shias and Jews have been murdered in this city or driven out, and a zillion Christians have fled. Mosul is now a completely Sunni town. You can�셳 see the misery of those who were murdered or driven out.
We turn off into a side street to meet someone from the media department who is going to explain what will happen next. We�셱e led through a glass door into a small shop. This is where �쏧sis Publishing�� conducts its business. The books and brochures piled up here will soon be distributed to mosques all over Isis territory. The latest flyers and brochures are laid out in a display case: �쏦ow to Handle Your Slaves��, �쏦ow to Swear Allegiance to the Caliph��, �쏦ow Women Should Behave and Dress��, �쏦ow to Look After the Poor��, �쏦ow to Be a Good Isis Fighter��.
Also on display is the first book officially published by Isis, Fiqh al Jihad (Understanding Jihad). Qatadah thinks that, if this book were found on me in Germany, I would be sentenced to at least seven years in jail.
I suggest we go into one of the small fish restaurants to eat masgouf �� carp baked in a clay oven, a speciality from Baghdad. It isn�셳 exactly the cleanest place in town. But as long as the food tastes good, we don�셳 mind. There is water and, of course, Pepsi to drink. Everyone likes the fish, which is indescribably crisp on the outside and wonderfully moist on the inside. Except for Qatadah. He orders a different fish, which he doesn�셳 like very much.
When I have to cross a neighbouring room on my way to the toilet, I see our two drivers from Raqqa without their masks sitting with two of our local escorts. I apologise and continue on my way. The strongly curved nose of our driver sticks in my mind. As does his long black hair, which falls down the back of his neck.
On the drive back to our bungalow, we notice there is something up with our driver. He�셲 furious with us again �� probably because I saw him without his mask. After we�셱e parked, he gives Frederic an unfriendly nod and signals that he should follow him. Bent slightly forward in a domineering manner, with his head to one side and his eyelid half closed, the driver stares hard at Frederic: �쏽ou will go and get your cameras now, including all your memory cards. You will give them to me. I will look at everything, make a copy for you, and give you your cameras back tomorrow morning. Are we clear?��
Frederic tries to tell him he�셲 not OK with that and that he needs his original memory cards back. We did not agree that Isis would make copies of his material. That is not going to happen under any circumstances.
Our driver is on the point of exploding. He is seething with rage.
Frederic sees that the situation could escalate at any time and he shrugs his shoulders. Then he gets his cameras and gives them to our poisonous chief driver before he blows up completely.
Confused, we go to our bungalow. Just before the entrance, Qatadah and I get into an argument about the behaviour of our driver. Suddenly, Qatadah starts shouting.
�쏻e don�셳 give a shit how you are welcomed and treated in other countries in the Muslim world. They are all just kissing your ass. We will not kiss your ass,�� he curses. �쏽ou are never satisfied. You are always asking questions. Challenging us the whole time, everything we do. And may I say, you are really pissing off some people here. We will not accept that.�� Our Isis minders are a bundle of nerves. We are, too.
An even greater distance develops between us and our escorts over the next two days in Mosul, before we return to Raqqa and begin the long wait to cross the border. Finally, on Monday 15 December, we are given our mobile phones back, and left to run in the shadow of an armed Turkish watchtower, across a ploughed field and over the border.
A couple of days after our return, Frederic gives me a call. �쏡o you recognise this voice?�� he asks. The voice I hear is unclear, but the rhythm of the speech seems familiar �� it�셲 our �쐂river��. Frederic says: �쏷hat is Jihadi John, the executioner.��
Later, Frederic plays me the video where Jihadi John threatens to behead two kidnapped Japanese nationals. It�셲 as though someone has slapped me upside the head. The rhythmic, driving speech pattern, the mostly half-closed eyes, that piercing stare, the body language �� exactly the same. Although the voice in the video has been electronically altered by lowering its pitch, for me there�셲 hardly a shadow of a doubt.
Frederic has one more surprise. He has found a YouTube video released by the infamous hacker group Anonymous, in which Jihad John�셲 voice has been restored as far as possible to its normal pitch. We can hardly believe how much it sounds like our driver. Recently published photos of Jihadi John show an incredible similarity to the man I saw �� albeit briefly �� without his disguise. They also match the outline of the masked face that sat across from me in the car for so many days.
None of this is 100% proof, and I would never pretend it is. But everything fits together. The way he appeared to have easy access to the journalist Cantlie. His irritation when I refused to take part in the propaganda show with Cantlie. His absurd disguise all day and all night. The way he freaked out when I happened to see him one day without it.
We have no doubt Isis will deny everything. After all, Jihadi John is one of the most sought-after terrorists in the world.
The next day, Frederic sends Qatadah the Anonymous audio. He asks whether the voice doesn�셳 remind him of our driver. The terse response comes right away.
�줥his is an edited extract from My Journey Into the Heart of Terror: Ten Days in the Islamic State by J체rgen Todenh철fer, published in English by Greystone on 21 April at 짙17.99
Britain�셲 intelligence agencies should have the legal power to break into the encrypted communications of suspected terrorists to help prevent any Paris-style attacks, David Cameron proposed on Monday.
The prime minister said a future Conservative government would aim to deny terrorists �쐓afe space�� to communicate online, days after a warning from the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, that the intelligence agencies are in danger of losing the ability to monitor �쐂ark places�� on the net.
His proposed legislation, which would be introduced within the first year of Cameron�셲 second term in Downing Street if the Conservatives win the election, would provide a new legal framework for Britain�셲 GCHQ and other intelligence agencies to crack the communications of terror suspects if there was specific intelligence of an imminent attack. Political approval would also be necessary.
The prime minister outlined his plans after meeting Britain�셲 intelligence chiefs in the wake of the Paris attacks. He promised to ensure there would be what officials describe as �쐍o no-go areas�� on the net where terrorists can hide.
Speaking after giving a speech on the economy in Nottingham, Cameron said: �쏧n extremis, it has been possible to read someone�셲 letter, to listen to someone�셲 call, to mobile communications �� The question remains: are we going to allow a means of communications where it simply is not possible to do that? My answer to that question is: no, we must not. The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.��
But the intervention by the prime minister was given short shrift by Nick Clegg, who criticised Cameron for standing up for freedom of expression by attending the rally in Paris on Sunday before advocating limits to freedom.
In a speech to the Journalists�� Charity at the Irish embassy on Monday night, the deputy prime minister said: �쏷he irony appears to be lost on some politicians who say in one breath that they will defend freedom of expression and then in the next advocate a huge encroachment on the freedom of all British citizens.��
The coalition clash came as senior EU officials prepared to hold discussions on Friday to allow government security services to trade information on travellers flying between European cities. Passport and identity checks are also to be reintroduced within the EU�셲 passport-free travel zone, according to measures being discussed urgently among governments in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
Senior European Union officials dealing with security and counter-terrorism are to meet in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to prepare new policies which will then be put to an EU summit next month.
After two years of attempts to produce a coherent counter-terrorism strategy that have produced scant results, European officials are galvanised by the Paris, attacks and are racing to correct perceived gaps.
One senior Liberal Democrat said the prime minister appeared to be suggesting he would try to ban UK citizens from Snapchat, the photo-sharing service which deletes messages within seconds.
Whitehall officials declined to be drawn on whether they would try to tackle services such as Snapchat. But the Guardian has established that the prime minister has in mind the need to create a better legal framework for breaking into and monitoring the encrypted communications of terror suspects.
The prime minister said the new legislation would be needed in two areas: the collection of communications data �� information about when a call is made, by whom and to whom; and the interception of calls and online communications, known as accessing content.
Interception would need to be approved by the home or foreign secretary.
Cameron said: �쏷he powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data, or on the content of communications �� I am very comfortable those are absolutely right for a modern, liberal democracy. The next government will have to legislate again in 2016. If I am prime minister, I will make sure that it is a comprehensive piece of legislation that makes sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other. That is the key principle: do we allow safe spaces for them to talk to each other? I say no, we don�셳, and we should legislate accordingly.��
The proposals will involve reviving some elements of the draft data communications bill, known as the snooper�셲 charter, which was rejected by Clegg. But the prime minister believes a different legislative vehicle will be necessary, possibly amending the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act (Ripa), which is being reviewed by David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation.
Fresh legislation is needed because the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (Drip), the emergency legislation pushed through last summer, expires at the end of 2016. Anderson told Radio 4 that the emergency legislation addressed some of the elements in the so-called snooper�셲 charter because it allowed some data powers to extend beyond the UK. He added that the counter-terrorism and security bill, which is about to be debated in the lords, makes it easier to find out which device used a particular IP address at a particular time.
Cameron�셲 intervention came as EU ministers prepare to press the social media industry �� providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter �� to cooperate in preventing jihadists and terrorists using the internet as recruiting sergeants and propaganda instruments inciting hatred and violence.
But the focus in Europe is on fast-tracking the pooling of air travel data within the EU, known as PNR or passenger name records, meaning that millions of EU citizens could have their personal information stored for years. The Spanish, with French and German support, are also pushing for curbs on passport-free travel within the Schengen area that covers most of the EU, though not Britain and Ireland, by reintroducing national border ID checks, moves previously rejected on the grounds that they will generate huge airport queues.
But the travel data storage is opposed by the European Parliament, while changing the Schengen rules is being resisted by the European Commission.
EU member states already supply PNR data to the Americans under a clutch of bilateral agreements and can introduce their own national travel data systems, as Britain has done.
But there is no pooling of such data between EU countries as the legislation has been blocked by the European Parliament since 2013. Laimdota Straujuma, the prime minister of Latvia which has just taken over the rotating presidency of the EU, and Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, are to demand an end to the parliament blockade this week in Strasbourg.
The calls for a bigger pan-European crackdown got louder last year with the ascendancy of ISIS in Syria, boosted by an estimated 3,000 Europeans joining its ranks, hundreds of whom are believed to have already returned home. The Americans are alarmed at the implications of radicalised EU nationals returning home from the Middle East and then using visa-waiver systems between Washington and the EU to board planes to the US.
On Sunday in Paris as dozens of world leaders joined hundreds of thousands on the streets, interior ministers from 11 EU countries, the US and Canada as well as top officials from the European Commission met to mull their options.
Eric Holder, the US attorney-general, complained that the Europeans were not doing enough to gain the cooperation of the social media in combatting Islamist violence, an official present said. The Americans are also demanding that they be allowed to retain travel data supplied by the Europeans for longer than the 10 years currently permitted, said another source involved in the policy-making.
Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, insisted that the rules governing the Schengen passport-free zone had to be changed.
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU commissioner for home affairs, resisted the demands from Spain and France for changes to the Schengen travel regime, pointing out that there is already scope for temporary introduction of document checks and the re-erection of national border controls if a government invokes emergency conditions.
Before changing the rules, said Natasha Bertaud, a commission spokeswoman, �쐄irst we want to make maximum use of the existing rules.��
Officials point out that revised rules would have made no difference in Paris as the three killed assailants were French nationals resident in the capital.
Officials involved in the discussions also say that the value of the computer data bases underpinning the Schengen system is impaired by the reluctance of national intelligence services, not least the British, to feed in information. The national services were sometimes happy to share intelligence with other countries, but loth to input the information into a pooled data base.
British intelligence, however, is slated for a key role in a new office under the Belgian government called the Syria Strategic Communication Advisory Team (SSCAT) which is �쐔o combat terrorist propaganda and the misleading messages it conveys��, according to Sunday�셲 meeting.
Cazeneuve also called for the European PNR regime. �쏻e are convinced of the irreplaceable usefulness of this tool at the European level.��
That view was dismissed by Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Greens MEP specialising in data protection.
�쏣U home affairs ministers are playing into terrorists�� hands by demanding �쁞ig brother�� measures entailing blanket data retention without justification. This approach provides a false sense of security for citizens, at the expense of their civil liberties.�� he said. �쏤ar-reaching data collection in France would not have prevented the odious attacks in Paris. The perpetrators were already known to security authorities. Instead of creating an ineffective dragnet on all air passengers, security authorities should have been exchanging the data they already had on these suspects.��
The British are the hawks on the counter-terrorism crackdown and strong supporters of the European PNR system, having previously also called for data collection on rail and ferry travellers.
Following the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, the British shaped an EU data retention directive, adopted the following year, allowing the capture and storage of electronic communications. But last April the European Court of Justice struck down the directive as in breach of the EU�셲 charter of fundamental rights.
That ruling means the collection and retention of travel data may also fall foul of the court.
�쏷he Paris stuff means that the council [EU governments] wants faster solutions,�� said Claude Moraes, the Labour MEP who chairs the parliament�셲 civil liberties committee. �쏧t has to be legislation that tackles terrorism but upholds freedom. They want to move quickly. And speed is not the enemy. But we have to exercise the greatest care. We don�셳 want legislation that collapses. It has to be watertight.��
The shift marks a turning point in British political thinking about the strategy against extremism and underlines the growing gulf between the British and American approaches to the continuing problem of radical Islamic militancy. It comes amid increasingly evident disagreements between President George Bush and Tony Blair over policy in the Middle East.
Experts have welcomed the move away from one of the phrases that has most defined the debate on Islamic extremism, but called it 'belated'.
'It's about time,' said Garry Hindle, terrorism expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'Military terminology is completely counter-productive, merely contributing to isolating communities. This is a very positive move.'
A Foreign Office spokesman said the government wanted to 'avoid reinforcing and giving succour to the terrorists' narrative by using language that, taken out of context, could be counter-productive'. The same message has been sent to British diplomats and official spokespeople around the world.
'We tend to emphasise upholding shared values as a means to counter terrorists,' he added.
Many senior British politicians and counter-terrorism specialists have always been uneasy with the term 'the war on terror', coined by the White House in the week following the 9/11 attacks, arguing that the term risked inflaming opinions worldwide. Other critics said that it was too 'military' and did not adequately describe the nature of the diverse efforts made to counter the new threat.
Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of MI5, recently stressed the threat from growing radicalisation among young British Muslims. Whitehall officials believe that militants use a sense of war and crisis and a 'clash of civilisations' to recruit supporters, and thus the use of terms such as 'war', 'war on terror' or 'battle' can be counter-productive.
Though neither Blair nor Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, has used the term 'war on terror' in a formal speech since June, President Bush continues to employ the term liberally. The American leader spoke of how he hoped that Iraq would become 'an ally in the war on terror' during a joint press briefing with Blair in Washington last Friday.
A spokesman for the US State Department yesterday told The Observer that there was no question of dropping the term. 'It's the President's phrase, and that's good enough for us,' she said.
The White House website has a page devoted to explaining the 'war on terrorism', the terminology preferred by the Pentagon, and how it will be won. In April this year Bush compared the 'war on terror' to the Cold War in a keynote speech.
Not all British government figures are abiding by the advice, issued by the Foreign Office's Engaging with the Islamic World Unit. Writing in the Sun recently, Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to 'our police and armed forces in the front line of the war on terror'.
'One of the problems will be getting all parts of government to abide [by the new guidelines],' said Hindle, the RUSI expert. 'Whether the Home Office will want to follow remains to be seen. And politicians all have their own agendas.'
The US justice department is preparing a report which concludes that the FBI repeatedly broke the law by invoking terrorism emergencies that did not exist to obtain more than 2,000 telephone call records over four years from 2002, including those of journalists on US newspapers, according to emails obtained by the Washington Post.
The bureau also issued authorisations for the seizure of records after the fact, in order to justify unwarranted seizures.
The Washington Post said the emails show how counter-terrorism 짯officials inside FBI headquarters breached regulations designed to protect civil liberties.
The FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni, told the Washington Post that the agency violated privacy laws by inventing non-existent terrorist threats to justify collecting the phone records. "We should have stopped those requests from being made that way," she said.
Caproni said that FBI's issuing of authorisations after the fact was a "good-hearted but not well thought-out" move to give the phone companies legal cover for handing over the records.
After the 9/11 attacks, the USA patriot act greatly expanded the government's ability to monitor American citizens, including increased access to their phone calls with the approval of lower-level officials than previously allowed. But the authorisation had to be tied to an open terrorism investigation.
The Washington Post said two FBI officers had raised concerns. Special agent Bassem Youssef observed that the necessary authorisations were not being sought before phone records were seized and were sometimes only given later in response to complaints from phone companies. Another official, Patrice Kopistansky of the FBI's legal office, noticed a similar problem. She also raised concerns when she was unable to get investigators to provide her with an open terrorism case to justify issuing relevant authorisation.
The Washington Post reported that Kopistansky and Youssef discussed the worsening "backlog" of cases without the necessary authorisations, or where false claims were made about terrorism emergencies. "I also understand some of these are being done as emergencies when they aren't necessarily emergencies," Kopistansky wrote to Youssef in April 2005.
The FBI subsequently issued a blanket authorisation covering all past searches, although its legality was questioned.
The Washington Post said journalists on the newspaper and the New York Times were among those whose phone records were illegally searched. The FBI later apologised to editors of both papers.
When Bilal Berjawi spoke to his wife for the last time, he had no way of being certain that he was about to die. But he should have had his suspicions.
A short, dumpy Londoner who was not, in the words of some who knew him, one of the world's greatest thinkers, Berjawi had been fighting for months in Somalia with al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group. His wife was 4,400 miles away, at home in west London. In June 2011, Berjawi had almost been killed in a US drone strike on an al-Shabaab camp on the coast. After that he became wary of telephones. But in January last year, when his wife went into labour and was admitted to St Mary's hospital in Paddington, he decided to risk a quick phone conversation.
A few hours after the call ended Berjawi was targeted in a fresh drone strike. Perhaps the telephone contact triggered alerts all the way from Camp Lemmonier, the US military's enormous home-from-home at Djibouti, to the National Security Agency's headquarters in Maryland. Perhaps a few screens also lit up at GCHQ in Cheltenham? This time the drone attack was successful, from the US perspective, and al-Shabaab issued a terse statement: "The martyr received what he wished for and what he went out for."
The following month, Berjawi's former next-door neighbour, who was also in Somalia, was similarly "martyred". Like Berjawi, Mohamed Sakr had just turned 27 when he was killed in an air strike.
Four months later, the FBI in Manhattan announced that a third man from London, a Vietnamese-born convert to Islam, had been charged with a series of terrorism offences, and that if convicted he would face a mandatory 40-year sentence. This man혻was promptly arrested by Scotland Yard and is now fighting extradition to the US. And a few weeks after that, another of Berjawi's mates from London was detained after travelling from Somalia to Djibouti, where he was interrogated for months by US intelligence officers before being hooded and put혻aboard an aircraft. When 23-year-old Mahdi Hashi혻next saw daylight, he was being led into a courtroom in Brooklyn.
That these four men had something in common is clear enough: they were all Muslims, all accused of terrorism offences, and all British (or they were British: curiously, all of them unexpectedly lost their British citizenship just as they were about to become unstuck). There is, however, a common theme that is less obvious: it appears that all of them had found their way on to the "disposition matrix".
When contemplating the euphemisms that have slipped into the lexicon since 9/11, the adjective Orwellian is difficult to avoid. But while such terms as extraordinary rendition, targeted killing and enhanced interrogation are universally known, and their true meanings �� kidnap, assassination, torture �� widely understood, the disposition matrix has not yet gained such traction.
Since the Obama administration largely shut down the CIA's rendition programme, choosing instead to dispose of its enemies in drone attacks, those individuals who are being nominated for killing have been discussed at a weekly counter-terrorism meeting at the White House situation room that has become known as Terror Tuesday. Barack Obama, in the chair and wishing to be seen as a restraining influence, agrees the final schedule of names. Once details of these meetings began to emerge it was not long before the media began talking of "kill lists". More double-speak was required, it seemed, and before long the term disposition matrix was born.
In truth, the matrix is more than a mere euphemism for a kill list, or even a capture-or-kill list. It is a sophisticated grid, mounted upon a database that is said to have been more than two years in the development, containing biographies of individuals believed to pose a threat to US interests, and their known or suspected locations, as well as a range of options for their disposal.
It is a grid, however, that both blurs and expands the boundaries that human rights law and the law of war place upon acts of abduction or targeted killing. There have been claims that people's names have been entered into it with little or no evidence. And it appears that it will be혻with us for many years to come.
The background to its creation was the growing realisation in Washington that the drone programme could be creating more enemies than it was destroying. In Pakistan, for example, where the government estimates that more than 400 people have been killed in around 330 drone strikes since 9/11, the US has arguably outstripped even India as the most reviled foreign country. At one point, Admiral Mike Mullen, when chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, was repo rted to be having furious rows over the issue with his opposite number in Pakistan, General Ashfaq Kayani.
The term entered the public domain following a briefing given to the Washington Post before last year's presidential election. "We had a disposition problem," one former counter-terrorism official involved in the development of the Matrix told the Post. Expanding on the nature of that problem, a second administration official added that while "we're not going to end up in 10 years in a world of everybody holding hands and saying 'we love America'", there needed to be a recognition that "we can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us".
Drawing upon legal advice that has remained largely secret, senior officials at the US Counter-Terrorism Center designed a grid that incorporated the existing kill lists of the CIA and the US military's special forces, but which also offered some new rules and restraints.
Some individuals whose names were entered into the matrix, and who were roaming around Somalia or Yemen, would continue to face drone attack when their whereabouts become known. Others could be targeted and killed by special forces. In a speech in May, Obama suggested that a special court could be given oversight of these targeted killings.
An unknown number would end up in the so-called black sites that the US still quietly operates in east Africa, or in prisons run by US allies in the Middle East or Central Asia. But for others, who for political reasons could not be summarily dispatched or secretly imprisoned, there would be a secret grand jury investigation, followed in some cases by formal arrest and extradition, and in others by "rendition to justice": they would be grabbed, interrogated without being read their rights, then flown to the US and put on trial with a publicly funded defence lawyer.
Orwell once wrote about political language being "designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable". As far as the White House is concerned, however, the term disposition matrix describes a continually evolving blueprint not for murder, but for a defence against a threat that continues to change shape and seek out new havens.
As the Obama administration's tactics became more variegated, the British authorities co-operated, of course, but also ensured that the new rules of the game helped to serve their own counter-terrorism objectives.
Paul Pillar, who served in the CIA for혻28 years, including a period as the agency's senior counter-terrorism analyst, says the British, when grappling with what he describes as a sticky case �� "someone who is a violence-prone anti-western jihadi", for example �� would welcome a chance to pass on that case to the US. It would be a matter, as he puts it, of allowing someone else to have their headache.
"They might think, if it's going to be a headache for someone, let the Americans have the headache," says Pillar. "That's what the United States has done. The US would drop cases if they were going to be sticky, and let someone else take over. We would let the Egyptians or the Jordanians or whoever take over a very sticky one. From the United Kingdom point of view, if it is going to be a headache for anyone: let the Americans have the headache."
The four young Londoners �� Berjawi, Sakr, Hashi and the Vietnamese-born convert �� were certainly considered by MI5 and MI6 to be something of a headache. But could they have been seen so problematic �� so sticky �� that the US would be encouraged to enter their names into the Matrix?
Berjawi and Sakr were members of a looseknit group of young Muslims who were on nodding terms with each other, having attended the same mosques and schools and having played in the same five-a-side football matches in west London.
A few members of this group came to be closely scrutinised by MI5 when it emerged that they had links with the men who attempted to carry out a wave of bombings on London's underground train network on 21 July 2005. Others came to the attention of the authorities as a result of their own conduct. Mohammed Ezzouek, for example, who attended North Westminster community school with Berjawi, was abducted in Kenya and interrogated by British intelligence officers after a trip to Somalia in 2006; another schoolmate, Tariq al-Daour, has recently been released from jail after serving a sentence for inciting terrorism.
As well as sharing their faith and, according to the UK authorities, jihadist intent, these young men had something else in common: they were all dual nationals. Berjawi was born in Lebanon and moved to London with his parents as an infant. Sakr was born in London, but was deemed to be a British-Egyptian dual national because his parents were born in Egypt. Ezzouek is British-Moroccan, while al-Daour is British-Palestinian.
This left them vulnerable to a little-known weapon in the government's counter-terrorism armoury, one that Theresa May has been deploying with increasing frequency since she became home secretary three years ago. Under the terms of a piece of the 2006 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, and a previous piece of legislation dating to 1981, May has the power to deprive dual nationals of their British citizenship if she is "satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public혻good".
This power can be applied only to dual nationals, and those who lose their citizenship can appeal. The government appears usually to wait until the individual has left the country before moving to deprive them of their citizenship, however, and appeals are heard at the highly secretive special immigration appeals commission (SIAC), where the government can submit evidence that cannot be seen or혻challenged by the appellant.
The Home Office is extraordinarily sensitive about the manner in which this power is being used. It has responded to Freedom of Information Act requests about May's increased use of this power with delays and appeals; some information requested by the Guardian in June 2011 has still not been handed over. What is known is that at least 17 people have been deprived of their British citizenship at a stroke of May's pen. In most cases, if not all, the home secretary has taken action on the recommendation of MI5. In each case, a warning notice was sent to the British home of the target, and the deprivation order signed a day or two later.
One person who lost their British citizenship in this way was Anna Chapman, a Russian spy, but the remainder are thought to all be Muslims. Several of them �� including a British-Pakistani father and his three sons �� were born in the UK, while most of the others arrived as children. And some have been deprived of their citizenship not because they were assessed to be involved in terrorism or any other criminal activity, but because of their alleged involvement in Islamist extremism.
Berjawi and Sakr both travelled to Somalia after claiming that they were being harassed by police in the UK, and were then stripped of their British citizenship. Several months later they were killed. The exact nature of any intelligence that the British government may have shared with Washington before their names were apparently entered into the disposition matrix is deeply secret: the UK has consistently refused to either confirm or deny that it shares intelligence in support of drone strikes, arguing that to do so would damage both national security and relations with the US government.
More than 12 months after Sakr's death, his father, Gamal, a businessman who settled in London 37 years ago, still cannot talk about his loss without breaking down and weeping. He alleges that one of his two surviving sons has since been harassed by police, and suspects that this boy would also have been stripped of his citizenship had he left the country. "It's madness," he cries. "They're driving these boys to Afghanistan. They're making everything worse."
Last year Gamal and his wife flew to Cairo, formally renounced their Egyptian citizenship, and on their return asked their lawyer to let it be known that their sons were no longer dual nationals. But while he wants his family to remain in Britain, the manner in which his son met his death has shattered his trust in the British government. "It was clearly directed from the UK," he says. "He wasn't just killed: he was assassinated."
Mahdi Hashi was five years old when his family moved to London from Somalia. He returned to the country in 2009, and took up arms for al-Shabaab in its civil war with government forces. A few months earlier he had complained to the Independent that he been under pressure to assist MI5, which he was refusing to do. Hashi was one of a few dozen young British men who have followed the same path: in one internet video clip, an al-Shabaab fighter with a cockney accent can be heard urging fellow Muslims "living in the lands of disbelief" to come and join him. It is thought that the identities of all these men are known to MI5.
After the deaths of Berjawi and Sakr, Hashi was detained by al-Shabaab, who suspected that he was a British spy, and that he was responsible for bringing the혻drones down on the heads of his brothers-in-arms. According to his US lawyer, Harry Batchelder, he was released in early June last year. The militants had identified three other men whom they believed were the culprits, executing them shortly afterwards.
Within a few days of Hashi's release, May signed an order depriving him of his British citizenship. The warning notice that was sent to his family's home read: "The reason for this decision is that the Security Service assess that you have been involved in Islamist extremism and present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom due to your extremist activities."
Hashi decided to leave Somalia, and travelled to Djibouti with two other fighters, both Somali-Swedish dual nationals. All three were arrested in a raid on a building, where they had been sleeping on the roof, and were taken to the local intelligence agency headquarters. Hashi says he was interrogated for several weeks by US intelligence officers who refused to identify themselves. These men then handed him over to a team of FBI interrogators, who took a lengthy statement. Hashi was then hooded, put aboard an aircraft, and flown to New York. On arrival he was charged with conspiracy to support a terrorist organisation.
Hashi has since been quoted in a news report as saying he was tortured while in custody in Djibouti. There is reason to doubt that this happened, however: a number of sources familiar with his defence case say that the journalist who wrote the report may have been misled. And the line of defence that he relied upon while being interrogated �� that Somalia's civil war is no concern of the US or the UK �� evaporated overnight when al-Shabaab threatened to launch attacks in Britain.
When Hashi was led into court in Brooklyn in January, handcuffed and dressed in a grey and orange prison uniform, he was relaxed and smiling. The 23-year-old had been warned that if he failed to co-operate with the US government, he would be likely to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But he appeared unconcerned.
At no point did the UK government intervene. Indeed, it cannot: he is no longer British.
When the Home Office was asked whether it knew Hashi was facing detention and forcible removal to the US at the point at which May revoked his citizenship, a spokesperson replied: "We do not routinely comment on individual deprivation cases, nor do we comment on intelligence issues."
The Home Office is also refusing to혻say whether it is aware of other individuals being killed after losing their British citizenship. On one point혻it is unambiguous, however. "Citizenship," it said in a statement, "is혻a privilege, not a right."
A glimpse of even closer UK-US counter-terrorism co-operation can be seen in the case of the Vietnamese-born convert, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Born in 1983 in the far north of Vietnam, he was a month old when his family travelled by sea to Hong Kong, six when they moved to the UK and settled in London, and 12 when he became a British citizen.
While studying web design at a college in Greenwich, he converted to Islam. He later came into contact with the banned Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, and was an associate of Richard Dart, a fellow convert who was the subject of a TV documentary entitled My Brother the Islamist, and who was jailed for six years in April after travelling to Pakistan to seek terrorism training. In December 2010, this man told his eight-months-pregnant wife that he was going to Ireland for a few weeks. Instead, he travelled to Yemen and stayed for seven months. MI5 believes he received terrorism training from al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula and혻worked on the group's online magazine, Inspire.
He denies this. Much of the evidence against him comes from a man called Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali who once lived in the English midlands, and who was "rendered to justice" in much the same way as Hashi after being captured in the Gulf of Aden two years ago. Warsame is now co-operating with the US Justice Department.
On arrival back at Heathrow airport, the Vietnamese-born man was searched by police and arrested when a live bullet was found in his rucksack. A few months later, while he was free on bail, May signed혻an order revoking his British citizenship. Detained by immigration officials and facing deportation to Vietnam, he appealed to SIAC, where he was given the cipher혻B2. He won his case after the Vietnamese ambassador to London gave evidence in which he denied that혻he was one of their citizens. Depriving him of British citizenship at혻that point would have rendered him혻stateless, which would have been혻unlawful.
Within minutes of SIAC announcing its decision and granting B2 unconditional bail, he was rearrested while sitting in the cells at the SIAC building. The warrant had been issued by magistrates five weeks earlier, at the request of the US Justice Department. Moments after that, the FBI announced that B2 had been charged with five terrorism offences and faced up to 40 years in jail.
