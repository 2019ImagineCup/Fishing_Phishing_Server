(MARSHALL,TX)--Harrison County Sheriff¡¯s Office is receiving calls from citizens inquiring about warrants that are supposed to be issued for their arrest.

This is another twist on the bogus telephone call using official sounding circumstances.

The scammer sets up the caller as an official of the Harrison County Sheriff¡¯s Office or District Attorney¡¯s office and they want to have the person settle a case prior to being taken to court, or to post a bond for a bogus offense that has been filed against the person.

The caller gives the person a ¡°case number¡±, which is bogus. The caller will then ask the person to get a Wal-Mart, CVS, or loadable credit card, for an amount of money to settle the case.

They are then given a telephone number to call. That number has been an area code of 844, which is a toll free number, recently.

After the person has obtained the card, they are instructed to call another telephone number and give the PIN number on the back of the card.

This money is then accessed by that PIN number. This is not a legitimate phone call. The District Attorney or Sheriff¡¯s Office will not call anyone and ask for a payment.

Once this person has taken the money from the card, there is no method to retrieve the money.

The caller is most often in a foreign country and using cell phones that they manipulate to appear that they are legitimate callers from Harrison County.

As the holiday season is under-way, please be mindful that there are people that are preying on citizens and using scare tactics to take money from unsuspecting citizens.

"Many of these people that have been contacted are terrorized by these folks. They will continue to call them and quite honestly, scare them and harass them," says Lt. Jay Webb, Harrison County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer.

"The scams this time of year come around the Publisher's Clearing House. If you didn't enter the Publisher's Clearing House, you didn't win anything. They will also tell you they are from a lottery commission. Many of the times they use the lottery commissions of overseas agencies. Unless you were overseas and you bought a lottery ticket, you didn't win anything."

You might think only the naive and gullible fall victim to online scams, but scammers actually target everyone. Here's how to avoid falling into their traps.

Thousands of Australians have received a voicemail message that¡¯s likely to have sent shivers down their spine.

The robotic-sounding voice warns the recipient that they are the subject of a lawsuit and should return the call immediately.

If they don¡¯t, a warrant will be issued for their arrest, the message threatens.

This is the latest iteration of a well-worn scam which demands payment of a tax debt ? and it has fleeced unsuspecting and terrified victims out of thousands of dollars each.

Authorities say elderly people are especially prone to believe the claim and are often threatened by fraudsters when they phone the number back.

¡°The reason behind this call is that there is a lawsuit cases getting filed under your name,¡± the computer-generated message begins.

¡°The moment you get this message I want you to get back to me on my department division number. Now, if we don¡¯t hear from you, we have to issue arrest warrant under your name and get you arrested so get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you.¡±

In a call received by this reporter on Wednesday, the return telephone number was 08 6102 5755. The number has been reported and now appears to have been discarded by the scammers.

The Australian Taxation Office has received 28,000 reports about attempted scams since July 1, with the lawsuit-related telephone call among them.

The ATO¡¯s Assistant Commissioner Kath Anderson said fraudsters are growing increasingly sophisticated and hope to exploit vulnerable people, often using aggressive tactics to swindle people out of their money or personal information.

The phone numbers used to call victims are always Australian-based and the latest round have carried West Australian and Victorian area codes.

However, cyber crime police have said in the past that the scammers are unlikely to be calling from Australia, but using a call forward service instead.

Some fraudsters will even offer to contact a victim¡¯s accountant to verify that they owe money and then dial in an accomplice who impersonates the tax agent.

RELATED: Been getting voicemails in Mandarin left on your phone? Here¡¯s what to do

Ms Anderson said the peak season for scammers was about to begin, with the November 21 deadline for 2017-18 income tax payments fast approaching.

¡°Be wary if someone contacts you demanding payment of a tax debt you didn¡¯t know you owed,¡± Ms Anderson said.

Payments through Bitcoin ATMs have now overtaken iTunes vouchers as the most common method of scam payments reported to the ATO.

¡°Our advice is simple ? the ATO will never ask you to make a payment into an ATM or via gift or prepaid cards such as iTunes and Visa cards, or direct credit to be paid to a personal bank account,¡± Ms Anderson said.

The ATO never demands the immediate payment of debts in any circumstances, she said, and despite the taxman¡¯s hard-nosed reputation, rudeness and aggression are not standard tacts.

¡°That¡¯s just not how we do business,¡± she said.

¡°If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a call, hang up and call us on 1800 008 540.¡±

The ATO is also worried about the number of people who fall victim to non-financial scams and hand over valuable personal information to criminals.

Since July 1, some 6000 Australians have given away sensitive details including tax file numbers, bank account details and dates of birth.

¡°Your identifying information can be used by scammers to break into your life if they are compromised,¡± Ms Anderson said.

¡°If you¡¯ve received an unsolicited email or text, or if you have any doubts about whether any contact is legitimately from the ATO, don¡¯t hesitate to get in touch with us to check.

¡°Scammers have been known to impersonate tax agents too so it¡¯s recommended that you hang up and call your agent direct on a number you have sourced independently.¡±

The Better Business Bureau of the Mid-South and the FBI are warning small business owners and franchisees in the Memphis area about a new phone scam that could cost them a full day's profit if they fall for it.

At least two local businesses have already been impacted.

Here's how the scam works: Someone will call the company, usually during the closing shift on a Saturday or Sunday. The caller will pretend to be someone with authority, in the case of franchises, the chief operating officer from the corporate office.

To further establish their authority, the scammer may also share some personal information about the company before saying there is a threat either to an individual employee or the whole company and tell the employee to gather all the cash on hand and put it all on a prepaid debit card.

"The employees who received the calls were told that they, too, would be in trouble if they did not cooperate," the BBB said in a written statement.

Once the cards are purchased, the employee is instructed to call back and give the caller the numbers. After that, a day's profit is gone.

The BBB and the FBI is warning small business owners to train their employees, especially those working nights and weekends, so more businesses aren't victimized.

The BBB didn't share which franchisees were targeted.

How to spot this scam

There are things to look out for that can often help employees and business owners tell when they are talking to a scammer, according to the BBB.

Scammers will often pretend to be a person in authority or someone employees will know and trust. They will then try to intimidate the employee and create a sense of urgency to make the employee act fast so there is no time to check on what they have been told.

It's also common to use untraceable payment methods like wire transfers, prepaid cards and gift cards.

How to report if you get a call

If you are a victim of this scam or get a similar phone call, contact the Memphis FBI Complaint hotline at 901-747-4300, the Arkansas FBI at 501-221-9100, or the Jackson FBI at 601-948-5000 to file a complaint.

A Kamloops resident is out $4,000 after receiving a phone call from a scammer and Mounties are warning others to be wary of such fraudsters.

Cpl. Jodi Shelkie said the victim answered a call from a man claiming to be employed in the security department of a major Canadian bank.

The caller told the victim to use a credit card to purchase Apple gifts cards and, utilizing a downloaded computer program, scan and upload the card¡¯s information into the program. The victim was assured they would be reimbursed for the expenditure by the bank.

Alas, when the $4,000 was not reimbursed, the victim called the bank and learned it was a scam.

Shelkie said people need to be wary of calls, texts or emails from people claiming to be from a bank.

¡°Banks will never request that their customers purchase gift cards of any kind,¡± Shelkie said. ¡°If you are unsure if a phone call, letter or email is a scam, check with the bank by contacting them yourself. Look up the bank¡¯s phone number independently or go in person.¡±

Scams can be reported to the federal government¡¯s Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre by calling 1-888-495-8501. It is a toll-free number.

A 23-year-old Hong Kong woman has been cheated out of 121,000 yuan (HK$136,000) by fraudsters posing as mainland officials on the phone, becoming the latest victim as such scams more than doubled citywide over the past four months.

The woman, who lives in May Shing Court, Sha Tin, received a call from a man impersonating a law enforcement agent from across the border, according to police.

¡°She was accused of being involved in a criminal case and ordered to reveal her bank information,¡± police said in a statement. As instructed, she complied with the con artist.

Girl, 14, among 82 students to lose HK$7.6 million in phone scams over 4 months

She realised it was a scam when she later found out the money had been transferred from her bank to another account, and called police at 9.17pm on Tuesday.

Detectives from the Sha Tin criminal investigation unit are handling the case. No arrests have been made.

Between July and October, police handled 138 phone scam cases involving fake mainland officials ? a 133 per cent rise compared with 59 reports in the first six months this year.

The 138 victims scammed in the past four months included 82 mainland and Hong Kong students who were conned out of HK$7.6 million (US$970,000) in total.

Among the cases was a first-year university student from the mainland, who was duped out of HK$950,000 in mid-September. The youngest victim was a 14-year-old girl who was accused of breaking mainland law and convinced into transferring HK$27,000 to a mainland bank account in the same month.

Hong Kong businessman cheated out of record HK$58m in phone scam

Among the 82 students, 17 per cent were working on a master¡¯s degree or PhD, 60 per cent were bachelor¡¯s degree students, while 7 per cent were in secondary school. The remaining 16 per cent were studying diploma or sub-degree programmes.

The surge had prompted the force to issue an alert on its website warning the public to be on the lookout for scammers.

In the whole of last year, police handled 698 phone scam cases involving bogus mainland officials.

The city¡¯s biggest telephone deception case involved a 52-year-old Yuen Long resident conned out of more than HK$58 million in 2016.

Many of those falling prey received pre-recorded calls from swindlers pretending to be the staff of couriers firms, telecom companies or the Hong Kong Immigration Department, before the calls were transferred to fraudsters impersonating officers from mainland public security departments.

Victims are often accused of violating mainland laws. They are then assured by scammers posing as mainland police officers that their case will be investigated properly if they transfer funds to a designated bank account as surety.

The Will County Sheriff¡¯s Office is advising licensed physicians, that several doctors within the Will County area have received phone calls from an unknown individual who claims to be a ranking Sergeant or Lieutenant with the Sheriff¡¯s Office. These individuals state that because the doctor did not show up for jury duty they will need to pay a fine or will be arrested. Some of the doctors who have made reports with us have stated that they were told that a Failure To Appear warrant had already been filed for their arrest. The Will County Sheriff¡¯s Department wants to remind people that this is a scam. These scammers are aggressive and appear legitimate by using Docket numbers and other legal terms in order to scare the person into believing them. In some cases, the individuals threaten the doctor with having their doctor¡¯s licenses pulled if they do not pay the fine. The phone numbers being used in the calls appear to be local callers, however, these phone numbers are fraudulent and untraceable. Neither the Sheriff¡¯s Office nor the Jury Commission will ever call citizens regarding jury duty no-shows. You are advised to simply hang up the phone if you receive one of these calls.

Phone scams are on the increase and a Saval woman was very lucky not to have been caught this week when a caller claiming they were from Danske Bank told her that her card had been added to Apple Pay and they wanted to remove it for her.

The lady wisely didn't give any information even though the caller seemed to know her and was able to give her full address. He told her he needed to send a text to her to confirm the removal.

"He stated that he needed confirmation to remove the card by sending a text."

The Co Down woman was so distracted with her baby in the background that she never read the text message properly when it came through and just gave the code to the caller.

As she explains "After I hung up I copped on....It was the verification to ADD it to Apple."

Realising the potential for fraud quickly she called Danske Bank and cancelled her card straight away and luckily wasn't out any money.

Commenting on her near miss the woman added "Just don't want it happening to anyone else. I don't have a clue where they got my details from"

Winnipeg police are warning the public about phone scammers they believe are targeting local numbers, faking a credit card fraud investigation to swindle money from victims.

In the scam, a caller will phone a victim and pretend to be a retail business, police said in a Wednesday news release. The callers advise victims their credit card was fraudulently used and then connect victims with a fake "investigator" who attempts to convince them to transfer money to protect it during the investigation.

One case has been reported so far, said Const. Jay Murray, but he suspects more have taken place and gone unreported.

In that case, an elderly woman got a phone call from an out-of-province jeweler, who said her credit card had been used to purchase an expensive item. The scammer then transferred the woman to a person who pretended to be an employee of a bank and told her an investigator would contact her.

Then, the victim got a call from a person who told her to dial 911 ? while the line was still open ? to confirm an investigation was underway.

The victim believed the caller had hung up, but the scammer remained on the line. The scammer then pretended to be a police officer and tried to convince the elderly woman to transfer a significant amount of money.

At that point, the victim became suspicious and contacted Winnipeg police, the release states.

Talk to older loved ones, police say

Murray said it doesn't appear the scammers are targeting elderly people specifically.

But Winnipeg police are advising family members and friends to speak to older loves ones to ensure they're not being targeted in this or any other type of scam.

Police also provided tips to help avoid scams:
? Be cautious of any unexpected callers, such as a bank. Take reasonable steps to confirm the identities of people who call.
? Financial institutions will never ask you to transfer money to external accounts for security purposes.
? Do not assume phone numbers appearing on call display screens are accurate.

More information and tools to report scams can be found on the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre's website.

The next time another unknown number unexpectedly rings your phone, send it straight to voicemail.

Or better yet, Pixel phone users can let their Google Assistant screen the call for them. The Google Assistant¡¯s new call screening feature (built into the Pixel 3 phone debuting this month, and coming to the Pixel 1 and 2 in November) prompts you to tap ¡°Screen call¡± when you get an incoming call from an unknown number. What¡¯s more, the A.I. assistant will answer the call for you and send a transcript in real-time, so that you can decide whether to pick up or block it as spam.

Here¡¯s how it works: The Google Assistant will answer the call for you, and an automated voice will alert the caller that you are ¡°using a screening service from Google¡± and that you will receive a copy of this conversation. It will then ask them to state their name and reason for calling, which will be sent to you in real time. If the call sounds legit, you can: answer it or text a response (for example, ¡°I¡¯ll call you back later¡±). If it sounds sketchy or the scammer doesn¡¯t identify themselves, then you can ignore the call, block the number and report it as spam.

Screening these calls is the safest way to weed out a legit caller from the scammers that spammed Americans with more than 30 billion robocalls in 2017 that cost consumers $350 million.

And it¡¯s only going to get worse.

Half of all mobile calls are expected to be spam robocalls in 2019, according to call protection company First Orion, which analyzed data from 50 billion calls over the last 18 months. It found the percentage of spam phone calls has jumped from 3.7% of total calls in 2017 to 29.2% in 2018 ? and it predicts that number will hit 44.6% by early 2019, and it will keep rising until half of all calls are spam by the year¡¯s end.

¡°Year after year, the scam call epidemic bombards consumers at record-breaking levels, surpassing the previous year, and scammers increasingly invade our privacy at new extremes,¡± said Charles D. Morgan, CEO and Head Data Scientist of First Orion, in statement.

Spam call blocking service YouMail also reports that a record 4.2 billion robocalls blew up our phones in August 2018 alone, with the average person getting 7.7 unsolicited calls. And robocalls increased 33.2% to 28.5 billion calls in the first eight months of this year, compared to the 21.4 billion robocalls in the same period in 2017. And ironically, this increase is partly due to more people screening their calls; turns out, ignoring the robocalls spurs the scammers to place even more calls while trying to get through.

¡°The problem is, the technology making these robocalls is cheap and easy to make, so it¡¯s a low barrier to entry,¡± Susan Grant, the director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, told Moneyish. ¡°They obviously work often enough that more scammers keep entering the market. And it¡¯s hard for law enforcement to go after every single robocall, because there are so many of them.¡± It is speculated that it costs just $0.01 for a spammer to place a spoofed spam call.

Clever con artists often try profiting off of topical subjects, like calling about donations following a national tragedy, such as powerful hurricanes like Florence and Michael, or a slew of phony IRS and debt collecting calls during tax season. They phish for your personal information, or get you to agree to buy shoddy products and accept fraudulent charges. And the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has warned that the calls asking, ¡°Can you hear me?¡± or ¡°Do you pay most of the bills in your home?¡± are probably trying to record you saying ¡°Yes¡± to use your own voice against you in authorizing charges on a bill or a stolen credit card.

And while the FTC received 63,000 complaints about illegal robocalls each month in 2009, that number increased almost sixfold to 375,000 complaints a month last year. So the FCC created a Robocall Strike Force in 2016 to hang up the con artists. The team is trying to develop technology to pinpoint where these calls are coming from so that they can shut them down. It also adopted new rules earlier this year allowing phone companies to proactively block calls that are likely to be fraudulent, like appearing to be from area codes that do not exist. The FCC also began exploring ways to set up a reliable system to verify that a phone call is really coming from the phone number that it claims to be coming from to stop ¡°neighborhood spoofing,¡± where scammers place calls that appear to be local because they have the same area code that you do.

¡°What people can do right now is use the tools that are being made available to them, and be very careful not to give personal information -- like your name, Social Security number or birth date - to somebody who calls them out of the blue, whether it¡¯s a live call or not,¡± said Grant.

And here¡¯s what else you can do to protect yourself in the meantime.
? REGISTER YOUR NUMBER: Register with the free National Do Not Call Registry if you haven¡¯t already at donotcall.gov or 1-888-382-1222. This will stop the legit marketers from calling you within a month.
? DON¡¯T PICK UP: When you get an unsolicited call from a number you don¡¯t recognize, let it go to voicemail. Many spammers won¡¯t leave a message. ¡°I hate to say you that you can¡¯t trust any callers these days, but you certainly have to be careful,¡± said Grant.
? NEVER SAY ¡®YES¡¯: If you do answer the suspicious call, or respond to a voice message from an unsolicited caller, do not answer ¡°yes¡± or offer any personal information during the conversation. If the caller asks something like, ¡°Are you the homeowner?¡± or ¡°Can you hear me?¡± politely respond, ¡°Where are you calling from, and why do you need this information?¡± The sooner you hang up after sensing a call is sketchy, there¡¯s less of a chance you¡¯ll let something slip.
? THE IRS, SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE DMV AREN¡¯T CALLING YOU: Hang up if the caller claims to be from the IRS, Social Security, the DMV or a similar agency, as government officials will only ever reach out to you through the mail, unless you call them first. And many spam callers claim to be debt collectors for debit and credit cards, student loan offices, banks and retailers. Hang up and contact your bank, credit card company or loan office directly to see if they actually need something.
? CHECK FOR CHARGES: If you fear you¡¯ve let something slip to a scammer, check your banking, credit card, phone and cable statements for unfamiliar charges. Call the billing company and dispute anything that you didn¡¯t knowingly authorize. Demand proof if they claim you were recorded approving the charge. And you can also contact the Federal Trade Commission to dispute charges.
? SEE WHAT YOUR PROVIDER PROVIDES: Look into what spam and robocall controls your phone carrier provides to block unwanted and anonymous calls, like AT&T¡¯s Call Protect, or T-Mobile¡¯s Scam ID and Scam Block. ¡°Most of these are free, so check your phone company¡¯s website to see what¡¯s available,¡± said Grant.
? THERE¡¯S AN APP FOR THAT: If you don¡¯t have a Pixel phone or use the Google Assistant, robocall-blocking apps are also popping up. Hiya, free for iOS and Android, flags potential scam calls, adds context to where unknown numbers might be to coming from and lets you report scam numbers in the app. Nomorobo for $1.99 a month on iOS works similarly to Hiya. Truecaller is a free iOS and Android app that alerts you to fraudulent calls before you pick up. And the free Should I Answer? app for Android crowdsources nuisance numbers, so users can warn each other about the worst unwanted call offenders.

And check out the FCC¡¯s web resources for blocking robocalls.

The caller said Erickson had two outstanding warrants costing $950 each for failing to report to jury duty.

Erickson said she believed the claim at first because she had received a questionnaire in the mail about federal jury duty.

"The timing having had that just happen, I kind of was like, 'oh my God, maybe this is legit' " said Erickson.

But it wasn't, which she soon found out when the caller threatened her with an arrest warrant.

"I think if you had a warrant they arrest you if they pull you over, but I'd never heard of somebody being called on their warrant, so that kind of was the first part of me thinking it's a scam," said Erickson.

So she called the scammers back, well aware of what was going on.

"Sergeant O'Connor Duluth Police Department what's going on now," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

After asking for Erickson's name, the scammer told her that she again had two citations for not showing up to jury duty.

"It's showing up on file that you were expected to serve on October 8, and you never showed up," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

To fix this, the scammer said Erickson should go to WalMart and buy a Department of Treasury card that she would then bring to the sheriff's office.

"We have to keep open lines of communication until you ride down here to the sheriff's department," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

Erickson was fortunate she caught onto the scam, but says elderly people she works with could be more at risk.

"I can't tell you how many elderly people I have had crying in tears, who have fallen for stuff like this scam, and have given these people and done what they said because they're scared, and find out it's a scam," said Erickson.

But she stresses it's something that could happen to any of us.

"It does seem legit. Anybody could have had jury duty that didn't come in their mail or they misplaced it," said Erickson.

Duluth Police say this scam is targeting mental health professionals, but say they do not know why that is.

Erickson says she has heard of other people that have been the victim of it as well.

She says says the number they are calling from is 218-755-7371.

Duluth Police say the scammers are convincing as they set up caller ID's similar to that of DPD's. DPD says to never answer an unknown number, or provide any personal information.

They want to remind the public that they will never call and demand money.

If you receive a call like this you are asked to hang up and call 911.

Yet another Hawkins Countian falls victim to phone/internet scam
###########################################################################################
Last month, Guy-Paul Larocque received a call from a man claiming to be a representative of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

The man claimed Larocque had qualified to receive a grant and needed to share some of his personal financial information before the payment would be released.

Although the man sounded ¡°like a person of authority,¡± Larocque was suspicious. For one thing, Larocque is Canadian, not American, so how could he be eligible for money from the IRS?

The second red flag may have been even more telling: The call had gone to Larocque¡¯s work phone. The work phone he uses as a sergeant on an RCMP team focused on protecting Canadians from phone scams.

Larocque decided not to let on that he knew the man on the other end of the phone was trying to scam him. He asked questions, and found the caller¡¯s responses to be vague and evasive. Eventually, the supposed IRS agent hung up on him out of frustration.

¡°If a person is refusing to provide answers to very basic questions, it¡¯s a good indication that it¡¯s a scam,¡± Larocque said Wednesday.

Larocque was speaking at a press conference announcing the latest developments in the RCMP¡¯s ongoing battle against the Indian call centres believed to be behind the Canada Revenue Agency scam.

The CRA scam typically takes the form of a phone call in which the recipient is told they owe money to the agency and are threatened with arrest if they do not pay. The scammers often try to receive their money via Bitcoin, gift cards, wire transfer or another unusual method of payment.

More than 74,000 complaints about the scam have been filed since the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre began tracking the activity in 2014. An estimated 4,000 Canadians have lost more than $15 million to the scam over the same time period.

None of that money is believed to have been recovered, and authorities believe there are many more victims who have never reported the crimes to police.

One blow was struck against the scammers in 2016 when a 750-employee call centre in India was busted. Several arrests were made there, as well as about a dozen in Canada.

The RCMP reported at the time that the arrests had led to a ¡°significant decrease¡± in the number of reports of CRA scams.

Since then, though, the reports have returned.

¡°It is a large problem for Canadians as well as the Indian government,¡± RCMP Supt. Peter Payne said at Wednesday¡¯s press conference.

Police have responded in kind. Three call centres in India were raided ¡°over the past few weeks,¡± Payne said, with ¡°several fraudsters¡± arrested.

Authorities did not have information on exactly how many people were arrested or where in India the call centres were located, but did say that officers were able to seize a spreadsheet containing information about more than 600 Canadian victims.

¡°The takedown of the call centres has been important for disruption of fraudulent scams which affect Canadians,¡± Payne said.

Speakers at the press conference said enforcement was unlikely to ever bring CRA scams to a complete halt, because the people behind them are able to shift their tactics to stay ahead of detection.

Paine said one such change has even taken place in the past few years, with the large-scale call centres like the one busted in 2016 replaced by smaller shops employing ¡°maybe a dozen or 15 people.¡±

The officials stressed that the most effective tool to curb the spread of the scam is through education.

¡°We know that other call centres will spring up ¡¦ but if we can really focus on prevention to educate people what is a fraud, then that will be better,¡± Larocque said through a French translator.

Newcomers to Canada are often said to be more at risk of becoming victims of the CRA scam. Payne said the RCMP are looking at expanding their anti-scam education efforts into languages other than English and French.

The Sandwich Police Department and the Will County Sheriff's Office both released press releases this week on phone scams that have occurred in their jurisdictions recently.

Sandwich Police officials say that suspects are spoofing the Social Security Association¡¯s 1-800 customer service number to try to and get personal information.

Spoofing means that a suspect can call from anywhere, but can make a victim's caller ID show a different number.

In these incidents, the caller says they work for the SSA and need personal information, like a Social Security number, to increase a benefit's payment.

Officials say that real SSA employees will never promise to increase benefits in exchange for personal information.

Another phone scam happening in the Sandwich area involves callers alleging they are from the Sheriff's Office, telling victims that there are warrants out for their arrests.

The caller will state that the victim has missed jury duty, and that an arrest warrant has been issued. They then ask that the victim pay for the warrant over the phone.

Sandwich Police officials say that warrants can not be taken care of over the phone.

Will County Sheriff's Office officials say that several doctors in the Will County area have received phone calls from an unknown individual who claims to be a ranking Sergeant or Lieutenant with the department.

The callers state that because the doctor or his wife did not show up for jury duty they will have to pay a fine or will be arrested.

Some of the doctors who have made reports have stated that they were told by the caller that a Failure to Appear warrant had already been filed for their arrests.

Sheriff's Office officials say that the callers are aggressive and appear legitimate by using docket numbers and other legal terms as scare tactics.

The phone numbers being used in the calls appear to be local, however, the numbers are fraudulent and untraceable.

Officials say that the Will County Sheriff's Office and the Will County Jury Commission do not call citizens regarding jury duty no-shows or to threaten arrest warrants.

The San Diego County Sheriff¡¯s Department is warning the public of a scam involving phone calls from suspects falsely claiming to be members of the department, asking for money.

The SDSO said scammers have recently been targeting residents of Poway and surrounding communities.

Here¡¯s how the scam plays out: an unknown person will call a potential victim, claiming the person they have called has a warrant for their arrest and owes money to the SDSO.

The impersonators try to cover their bases to look legitimate, sometimes giving the victim a real phone number belonging to the SDSO. At times, they have also used names of real employees that work for the department.

The SDSO said the scammers sometimes even try to arrange a meeting in the parking lot of a government building of sheriff¡¯s station to add to the ruse.

The department said Friday that these calls are never the real deal. The SDSO, the County of San Diego, or any of its employees will never contact the public via telephone to solicit money in the manner.

¡°Nor would any employees ever try to arrange a meeting to allow the ¡®payment¡¯ to be made,¡± the SDSO said.

The scam calls are under investigation. Anyone who gets a phone call like this should immediately hang up and report the incident to the Federal Trade Commission by clicking here.

The SDSO said victims who suffer a financial loss due to one of these scam calls can call the Sheriff¡¯s Communication Center at (858) 565-5200 or the law enforcement agency that oversees their community.

FRANKLIN COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) - Business owners are being targeted by a scam asking for $200 donations to help for Hurricane Michael relief in Franklin County.

Scammers are asking for the money to be paid over the phone, the Franklin County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook, and saying that Oyster Radio is sponsoring the event.

"It is not true," the sheriff's office said. "Do not pay anything over the phone and be very cautious of other scams."

SANTA CLARA, CA -- Santa Clara police arrested a Fremont man for allegedly trying to bilk the elderly by posing as someone with privileged information about a family member.

The police department was tipped off to the nationwide scheme by the Richland County Sheriff's Office in Montana when it said a 77-year-old resident in the state fielded a call from an unknown party who was trying to convince the victim that his grandson had been arrested and needed bail money. Over the course of several days, the victim was instructed to send over $20,000 to an address in Santa Clara.

Investigators set up surveillance at the pick-up location where they later observed Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla, 24, of Fremont arrive. He was detained and later arrested. During the probe, it was determined Kotla bilked four victims out of $28,000. He is believed to be an operational member in a list of national phone scams involving Medicare, prescription drugs, funderals, anti-aging products, investments, sweepstakes, contests, lotteries, mortgages, home improvement, IRS/taxes and utility services.

When in doubt, residents are asked to call the police department at 408-615-4700.

TUCSON, Ariz. - The Tucson Police Department says it has received several reports of a well-known phone scam.

TPD says a caller is pretending to be a family member in trouble or distress. Another person then takes the phone and says they have kidnapped the family member and a ransom must be paid. Police say the caller ID often shows an out of area phone number, but those can be spoofed to look like it came from a more local area.

The person on the other end of the phone is given information on how to obtain prepaid cards or other means of sending amounts of $5,000 or more.

TPD says if someone happens to get this call, a phone call to the family member can often reassure the victim. Victims can also ask questions that only the real family member would know to the scammers, such as names of other family members or pets.

Phone scams can be reported to the Federal Trade Commission here.

HOUSTON - There's a day for just about everything and Wednesday is National Utility Scam Awareness Day.

Ironically, some Houstonians are experiencing a scam where the scammer tries to get money from them over the phone.

Rex Solomon told KHOU 11 he got a call from someone claiming they worked for CenterPoint Energy.

Centerpoint officials say those calls are not coming from them.

Wednesday morning, Solomon says someone claimed to be Centerpoint when they called his jewelry business, telling his employee to pay up on a "past due bill" or lose electricity.

Solomon dialed the given call back number and told the alleged rep this:

"Yes, you are an electric company and you own all the transmission lines in the greater Houston area but you do not provide residential or business electrical services. You provide natural gas services in this unregulated market... and then there was just a click." said Solomon.

The number they were calling from is almost identical to a real CenterPoint number.

"I've spoken to another business owner this morning that had the exact same phone call." said Solomon.

CenterPoint officials told us scammers are targeting utility customers around the country.

They tell us their agents will never demand banking or credit card information over the phone.

Instead, they encourage you to call a number listed on your bill or their website.

They also ask you report it to your local utility provider and the Better Business Bureau.

¡°It's a numbers game. The more you hit, the more the chance that somebody's going to bite." said Solomon.

He hopes that sharing his story puts the odds in your favor. ¡°It's the season to be scammed and watch out for it!"

CenterPoint officials also say you should report any suspicious activity to police.

A 54-year-old former West Palm Beach man on Thursday pleaded guilty to multiple charges in connection with a sophisticated scheme to steal personal information about cell phone users to clone their numbers to make illicit profits.

Braulio DelaCruz Vasquez, who was picked up in his native Dominican Republic in August, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, credit card fraud, aggravated identity theft and other charges. He faces a mandatory two-year prison term when he is sentenced in U.S. District Court in Miami on Jan. 18.

The 2016 investigation, dubbed ¡°Operation Toll Free¡± by FBI agents, netted five arrests. A sixth man, Edgar Estarlin Peralta Lopez, remains at large. The others ? Edwin Fana, Farintong Calderon, Jose Santana and Ramon Batista ? are serving prison terms ranging from 36 to 75 months.

DelaCruz operated a call center from his West Palm home, federal prosecutors said. After his co-conspirators had stolen personal information from cell phone users¡¯ accounts, DelaCruz would reprogram the phones and make thousands of calls over the internet. Many of the calls were routed to Cuba, Jamaica and other countries with high calling charges, prosecutors said.

The calls were billed to customer accounts. DelaCruz received ¡°tens of thousands of dollars¡± from a Voice over Internet Protocol company for fraudulently routing international calls through his call center, prosecutors said.

MOUNTAIN BROOK, AL - A new phone scam has been reported to the Mountain Brook Police Department from a local resident, and the MBPD posted the details of the scam to social media to spread the word to other potential victims.

"One of our residents reported getting a text message on their phone," the statement from the MBPD said. "The text indicated it was from a company that owed our victim a refund of a certain amount of money. It further stated that they had been unable to contact our victim by phone, and to call them to get the refund."

Reportedly, when the victim called the number they spoke with a person that directed them to a website. The victim was given instructions on filling out information on that site, then told to type in the amount that had been indicated as the refund. When this was done, the amount changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars.

"The person on the phone then told our victim that there had been a mistake and that it had already gone through to our victim's bank account.

A look into the identity of serial con artist Dene Broadbent

The salacious details of unsolicited late night phone calls in which a former radio jock turned con-artist allegedly told his one-time personal trainer he ¡°wants (his) d***¡±, have been revealed in court.

Some might know Dene Broadbelt, 25, as real estate tycoon Harrison Eyles. To others he¡¯s Infinity Music Festival director Dene Mussillon, anti-bullying advocate Harrison O¡¯Connor, music promoter Nic Lloyd or Clay O¡¯Connor. But to NSW Police and local courts, he¡¯s now Luke Hemmings.

Mr Broadbelt has used several aliases and impersonated various characters for a string of failed business ventures and unpaid debts across Australia but has never been charged or convicted in relation to the matters.

News.com.au can exclusively reveal that the founder of the now defunct internet station Ridge Radio ? who was once accused of faking his own death ? last week pleaded guilty to the charge of using a carriage service to menace, harass and offend before it was dismissed on mental health grounds at Sydney¡¯s Downing Centre Local Court.

In a statement of police facts viewed by news.com.au, Mr Hemmings was alleged to have harassed Dale Berry, the owner of Peak Fitness gym in Woollamia on the NSW South Coast, in a series of unsolicited phone calls in July this year.

Mr Berry told police he was in bed asleep next to his wife and two-year-old daughter when Mr Hemmings made several calls to his mobile phone from 1.41am on July 12.

¡°I want your d***. How big is it?¡± Mr Hemmings allegedly said during one of the calls around 1.44am before the victim hung up on him.

Court documents allege that Mr Hemmings made further calls to Mr Berry two days later, around 9.40pm.

The victim replied: ¡°Good one, mate. You f***ing idiot. Now that you¡¯ve made contact, I¡¯ve seen the police and they can trace your number.¡±

Mr Berry¡¯s wife Shelby recorded the last phone call, according to the police statement of facts. Both the victim and witness have been ¡°unsettled by the phone calls¡±.

Mr Hemmings had attended a personal fitness session with Mr Berry about two years earlier but they didn¡¯t know each other on a personal level, the statement read.

Mr Hemmings, who lives with his mother in Surf Beach, NSW, was last week discharged by the magistrate on the condition he sees an allocated mental health care professional for two years and ¡°takes all medications, strictly as prescribed¡±.

In 2015, Mr Hemmings admitted to ¡°ripping off creditors in hundreds of thousands of unpaid fees and failed ventures¡±.

His past dealings have included promoting and selling tickets to bogus music festivals; hiring camera equipment, hotel rooms, limousines and services of small businesses on false work accounts; and luring teens out of school and work with the promise of a dream career before leaving them high and dry.

He has operated under various company names including Sly Creators, One 11 Agency, Aquaholic Photography, Colemans Studios, and VA Entertainment Australia and set up websites with fake staff profiles. He¡¯s tricked high school students, ambitious university graduates, a police officer, small business owners, aspiring musicians and professionals out of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

He promised to pay them back as long as they allowed him to film their reactions during the handover. Some humoured him and said they¡¯d welcomed the exchange if it meant they¡¯d get their money back. He has not yet delivered.

Dream Media Darwin owner Chris O¡¯Brien said Mr Hemmings still owed him about $20,000 after failing to pay for camera equipment hire in 2014.

¡°We sent him to Alice Springs for a job he said he was doing for Channel 9 (but it turned out to be a scam),¡± he said. Mr Hemmings had purported to be part of a film crew covering a story for the network about a charity cancer walk in the Outback.

Mr Hemmings went on to promote The Infinity Music Festival ? in Darwin and several NSW and Queensland country towns ? as a major electro-music event to be headlined by big name performers. It turned out be a sham and never went ahead.

Publicist Jarrod Meakins said he was hired by Mr Hemmings to promote the festival but quit when he wasn¡¯t paid for his work.

¡°Some of the artists being advertised didn¡¯t even know they were booked to play, because they weren¡¯t. The last thing I did was help announce Darwin, and after that I pulled out when I found out what he was up to,¡± he said.

¡°In hindsight ¡¦ It was never going to go ahead.¡± He was right.

Among the youngest of Mr Hemmings¡¯ victims was a teen who claimed he was tricked into dropping out of school with the promise of a dream career. He reportedly promised to pay him $25 per hour as an assistant for Aquaholic Photography before loading him up with professional camera equipment then luring him to the other side of the country and leaving him to find his own way home.

VA Digital Hire later alleged Mr Hemmings obtained the equipment using business accounts that were not settled, leaving unpaid bills estimated at $20,000.

Ulladulla Web Design owner Scott Richardson previously told news.com.au he was contracted by Mr Hemmings to create posters and online flyers for the Infinity Music Festival. He said Mr Hemmings never paid him the $2000 for his work.

Eagle Embroidery business owner Roy Day, based in Bega NSW, said Mr Hemmings made two separate orders to embroider ¡°photographer¡± and ¡°crew¡± on to work uniforms and post them to a Batemans Bay address in 2013. Mr Day did the work but was never paid the $2000 for his services.

Mr Hemmings was also at the centre of a dispute between unpaid performers at the Eagle FM Mini Day Event and Goulburn Radio, NSW, that same year.

As pressure mounted on Mr Hemmings to pay back the money he owed, a press release was sent to national media informing them of his death, in 2015.

¡°I have to inform everyone of the sad news that Dene Broadbelt, died unexpectedly on Saturday night when he took his own life,¡± the email read. ¡°There is to be a memorial service held ASAP (date and time will be announced as soon as possible). We would ask that Dene¡¯s final wishes are observed, and there are to be no flowers, donations to World Vision would be welcomed instead.¡±

Mr Hemmings ? who then called himself Dene Broadbelt ? wasn¡¯t dead. He denied he was behind the email.

Mr Hemmings later issued a press release where he claimed to be a changed man who had become an anti-bullying advocate. He said he had been approved by the NSW Department of Education to spread awareness about mental health in public schools.

A spokesman for the NSW Department of Education told news.com.au the claims it had approved Mr Hemmings were false and that it was the role of individual principals to approve or manage guest speakers in schools.

Mr Hemmings has previously claimed he was an official ambassador for Beyond Blue and Lifeline. Both organisations said the claims were untrue.

In another press release Mr Hemmings claimed he was writing an autobiography titled Too Good To Be True for a 2016 release. The title said it all, with a book about Mr Hemming¡¯s life yet to hit the shelves.

Instead, he turned his sights to a young entertainer from a reality TV show.

Singer-songwriter Ben Denman was reeling when he discovered his talent manager of six months, who he knew as Luke Hemmings, was actually Mr Broadbelt.

Mr Denman, whose stage name is Ben Oddie, said he was first contacted by Mr Hemmings after he appeared as a contestant on X Factor Australia earlier that year.

Mr Hemmings introduced himself over social media as a businessman from ¡®Sly Creators¡¯. He told Mr Denman he was impressed by his talent and could help make him a star.

Mr Hemmings claimed he worked with Blink 182 and 5 Seconds of Summer ? whose lead singer is also named Luke Hemmings. He said he knew international producers in Los Angeles who had worked with Afrojack, Iggy Azalea, Leona Lewis and Kelly Rowland, who had heard Mr Denman¡¯s music and wanted to work with him. He sent Mr Denman stock pictures of a luxury office he claimed was in the same building as Sony in Los Angeles.

He told Mr Denman he had leased the property as his LA headquarters and had lined up work and meetings for them to make the overseas move in 2017.

It was all a sham. In reality, Mr Hemmings was unemployed and, according to him, bankrupt. But it would take six months of being managed by Mr Hemmings until Mr Denman became privy to it.

¡°I couldn¡¯t believe it but lots of the other contestants on the show were getting signed by independent labels so I just thought that¡¯s what was happening to me as well,¡± Mr Denman told news.com.au at the time.

¡°I made a video for Facebook to announce my dreams were coming true and I was moving to LA and everything.¡±

It all unravelled when Mr Denman became suspicious of Mr Hemmings and questioned him about his real identity. He said Mr Hemmings immediately stopped responding to his emails.

Mr Hemmings¡¯ website soon disappeared and his business phone number was disconnected.

That same year, Mr Hemmings, operating under the alias of Harrison Eyles, the managing director of a business called Coast and Country Real Estate, attempted to lease a shopfront, order cars, and even held face-to-face interviews with people who replied to his job adverts.

Burswood Car Rentals owner Morrison Todd said Mr Hemmings owes him about $4000 for damaging a hired vehicle and unpaid bills.

¡°We had a credit card (when Mr Hemmings made the booking) but it stopped working after about one week,¡± he said.

Skip Film Productions NSW owner Noel Sadler ? who is one of the con-artist¡¯s victims ? said Mr Hemmings ¡°never follows through on anything he promises¡±.

¡°He doesn¡¯t see the consequences of his actions ¡¦ it¡¯s all about him and the right now,¡± he said.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

While several people have reported their cases to police there is no active investigation into Mr Hemming¡¯s dealings, according to NT Police. NSW Police didn¡¯t respond to questions

NSW Police previously told news.com.au its ¡°fraud squad (is) unaware of any incidents that are currently under investigation with this man¡±. Those who reported the incidents to police said they were told it was a civil case and they would have to go to court to get their money back.

The NSW Fair Trading complaints register only provides information about businesses that are the subject of 10 or more complaints in one calendar month.

¡°NSW Fair Trading has no current actions or prosecutions against Broadbelt,¡± a spokesman for NSW Fair Trading previously told news.com.au.

¡°Fair Trading¡¯s advice to consumers who are dissatisfied in their dealings with this trader is to contact the trader and try to resolve the matter in the first instance.

¡°Customers who are unable to resolve their issues with the trader are advised to lodge a written complaint with NSW Fair Trading at www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au.

¡°Fair Trading will assess the complaint to determine next steps.¡±

NSW Fair Trading is ¡°unable to intervene¡± if the dispute is between two businesses.

¡°Businesses seeking to recover debts may seek their own independent legal advice,¡± the spokesman said.

¡°In the event a debt is owed for services provided to a business, the creditor is advised to contact the NSW Small Business Commissioner on 1300 795 534 or 02 8222 4800, or online.¡±

Consumers are being warned not to be caught out by phone scams from far-flung destinations such as Antarctica that could leave them with a huge bill.

UAE residents reported receiving a series of calls from Antarctica, the tiny Pacific island of Nauru and Luxembourg in the past week.

Experts have warned phone users against returning missed phone calls from overseas numbers they don't recognise.

Users can be charged up to $50 per minute if they return the call.

Dubbed the Wangiri scam, those behind the scam have targeted phone users across the globe. Wangiri translates to ¡®one ring and cut¡¯ in Japan, where it first began.

Indian consulate warns fraudsters are using its name for a scam

Philip Hitchcox, 38, the leasing director for a Dubai property agency, received missed calls from Antarctica and Nauru - both established hubs for the scam - along with South Korea and Grand Prairie in Texas in the past week.

"At least with Antarctica, it's so unusual that you can tell it must be some sort of scam," he said.

"But people could be taken in by some of the other destinations. You do get calls from all over the world when working here."

"You do get a lot of unsolicited calls from companies here, for offers and upgrades, but I knew this must be something more suspect so I didn't answer," said the construction sector employee, who asked that her surname not be used.

"You do hear of scams that charge you by the minute, and of WhatsApp offers with dodgy links and so on."

Other social media users living in Dubai also shared images on Facebook and Twitter of missed calls from Antarctica.

The phone calls are usually disconnected after a few rings prompting the receiver to call back.

The method used by fraudsters involves routing people who ring back to a premium rate number. The callers are unable to disconnect as they are locked into an automated recorded message until it runs out after a few minutes.

The scam works by keeping the caller on the phone for a prolonged period connected to premium rate numbers.

The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority has urged residents to file any complaints with the service providers directly.

Both du and Etisalat have told residents to phone customer care services if they suspected hoax calls.

Residents have previously been targeted by fraudsters who promise to award them large sums of money while asking for bank details and personal information.

In a public advisory, du asked customers not to entertain calls from people they did not know, to be aware of fraudulent calls and to decline to divulge bank details.

RICHLAND COUNTY, Ohio - If you¡¯re in the Richland County area and receive a suspicious call from the Richland County Sheriff's Office, be warned: it's probably a scam.

According to deputies, a string of incidents have been reported to the actual Sheriff¡¯s Office. Citizens claim they have been receiving calls from a scammer identifying themselves as a law enforcement officer from the Richland County Sheriff¡¯s Office.

The scammer advises the citizen that they have warrants out on them and that the citizens need to go get money cards and meet the scammer at a designated location to pay the scammer so that the warrant can be dismissed, deputies said.

According to deputies, the scammer even goes as far as using a spoofing method to make the call appear to come from the sheriff¡¯s office dispatch. The number that appears is 419-524-2412.

The actual sheriff¡¯s office said that they will never ask citizens for money over the phone for any reason, as they handle all monetary transactions in person at the Sheriff¡¯s Office.

The Richland County Sheriff¡¯s Office urged citizens receiving these calls to simply hang up and ignore the scammer's attempts.

SAN ANTONIO, TX - "We'll turn off the heat if you don't pay," is the threat scammers are making while temperatures continue to plummet.

CPS is now seeing an increase in those types of scams. The company said bottom line, they will never threaten to turn off your energy to pay your bill.

One military family in San Antonio was fearful their power would be turned off and is now out hundreds.

Juanita and Eliseo Salazar are both 83 and retired.

They have lived in San Antonio for four decades, the same house the entire time. For the first time, just this week, a bill collector called for a late payment. Asking for $1,000.

The person on the other end of the phone gave Juanita a tough choice.

"He said, "If you don't want us to turn off your electric, you'll have to pay at least half of that," Juanita said.

With cold temperatures in our city, turning off the heat was the last thing they wanted.

"It got us rattled," Eliseo said.

Even though caller ID reads CPS, the energy provider said it's a scam, one they are seeing more of as temperatures continue to drop.

"Our money doesn't grow on trees," Juanita said.

They're living on a fixed income. The military father has military children and military grandchildren.

He ended up giving the scammer $500.

It's his mission to spread a message to families in Military City USA.

"Before you do anything, check with CPS," Eliseo said.

A 24-year-old Fremont man was arrested Wednesday in connection with a phone scam targeting elderly residents across the country, Santa Clara police said Friday.

Police in Richland, Montana, contacted Santa Clara police on Wednesday to tell them a 77-year-old man had been instructed to send $20,000 in bail money for his grandson to a Santa Clara address.

Officers set up surveillance at the pickup location and saw Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla arrive and retrieve the package at 6:04 a.m., police said. Kotla was detained and later arrested.

Police identified four other victims during their investigation and retrieved $28,000 in cash from the suspect's home. Kotla is believed to be a member of a group which targets and runs scams on elderly residents.

Police said residents should be wary of calls demanding money over the phone and call police at (408) 615-4700 when in doubt.

CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. ? Chambersburg police are warning of a telephone scam in which the caller claims to be a representative of Shell Oil Co. advising the person who takes the call that he or she won a substantial amount of money.

"In an attempt to legitimize the scam, the caller tells the individual to contact attorney John Donavan with Ropes and Gray Law Firm out of New York City. Another number is provided for the attorney. When called, another individual answers the phone and pretends to be attorney John Donavan," police said in a news release.

The person purporting to be Donavan tells the scam victim that he or she would owe the law firm $5,000 to obtain legal counsel before winnings could be claimed, the release said. The money was to be transferred by wire service.

Police said they talked to an attorney with the same law firm. That person said his firm has been dealing with the scam for about a week.

"Attorney Donavan does not represent Shell Oil Co. in any way," the release said.

Major Chinese technology firm Xiaomi has apologised after a "crazy deal" on its website sold a handful of mobile phones for ¡Ì1, angering customers.

The brand took flack when it advertised a "flash sale" offering phones for ¡Ì1 each, and it emerged only two or three phones were actually sold at this price before the website said it was "sold out".

The UK's ads watchdog said it had received a complaint and was deciding whether to open an investigation.

The "misleading" ads prompted backlash on social media, as some users called the company out for the "clickbait scam".

Xiaomi said it hoped customers would not be discouraged from taking part in future campaigns.

"We've held flash sales all over the world since our first one back in 2013 as a way to give a lucky few customers a chance to get their hands on our smartphones at incredibly low prices," said a spokeswoman.

"[This] was our first in the UK and attracted enormous levels of demand, far beyond what we were expecting.

"We're sorry so many Xiaomi fans missed out this time round but we hope they'll take part in future flash sales as and when we announce them."

Xiaomi has regularly held similar promotions, attracting consumer attention by selling its hardware at low profit margins to gauge demand.

Last year a promotion in space offered 50 units at ¢æ1 (88p), and in this latest spate of promotions in the UK, only two or three phones were sold at the advertised price.

Users needed to click on a link to its terms and conditions to read the fine print of the sale.

Xiaomi denied accusations that no phones had been sold at the promised price.

UK sales manager Wilkin Lee said a lottery had taken place made up of those who had pressed the button closest to the set time.

"Of the thousands who clicked 'buy' simultaneously, the tie-breaker is done by selecting the winners randomly," he tweeted.

The Advertising Standards Authority's rules state that consumers must be informed "clearly and in a timely fashion" about the limited availability of a product.

An ASA spokeswoman told the BBC: "If the ad didn't include significant conditions and the terms and conditions were changed part way through the promotion, then that could potentially be a problem."

Peterborough police say three more residents have lost thousands of dollars after falling victim to the Canada Revenue Agency phone scam.

Two incidents happened on Monday, police say. In one case, a 24-year-old woman received a voice message on her cell, stating she owed the CRA around $8,000 from two years ago and that there was an ongoing investigation into her debt. The message indicated she would be arrested for her outstanding debt.

Police say the woman informed the called she only had $4,000 but could repay the full amount later. However, the caller said she needed to repay the full amount on that day or face arrest.

As a result, the woman withdrew a $4,000 loan from a MoneyMart and then purchased $8,000 in BitCoins and sent a QR code to complete the transaction, police said. A family member later informed her she was likely a victim of fraud and she then called police.

Also on Monday, police say a 27-year-old woman received a similar call, stating she had to pay $5,000 to the CRA. Police say this woman sent $5,000 through BitCoin to an unknown person. She later called police to report the incident after she realized she had been scammed.

Earlier this month, police say a 57-year-old man also received a call from someone claiming to be a police officer investigating on behalf of the CRA.

¡°As a result of the phone call, the victim purchased $2,000 in Google Play gift cards and sent the fake officer the serial numbers on the cards in order to pay his fake debt,¡± police stated.

Det. Const. Keith Calderwood with the police service¡¯s fraud unit says scammers are aggressive and relentless.

¡°They are targeting everyone and anyone, regardless of gender or age,¡± he said.

¡°If you get a call from someone you don¡¯t know stating you owe money and threatening your arrest, stop, pause and think. Hang up, call a trusted friend or family member and call your bank.¡±

Calderwood notes the CRA will not ask for payment in the form of BitCoins, gift cards or prepaid credit cards.

¡°They will not threaten arrest or send a police officer to your home,¡± he said.

If believed to have been victimized by a scam, police advise residents to report the incident to the Peterborough Police Service or its online reporting system.

SANTA CLARA ? Police have arrested a man suspected of belonging to a national phone scam that bilked elderly people out of thousands of dollars by conning them in to believing their grandchildren were in trouble and needed large sums of cash fast.

Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla, 24, of Fremont, was booked at the Santa Clara County jail on suspicion of money laundering, forgery, conspiracy and grand theft, according to Santa Clara police. But jail records did not show anyone in custody under Kotla¡¯s name, suggesting that he posted bail.

Authorities say Kotla came to police¡¯s attention in Montana when the Richland County Sheriff¡¯s Office were investigating a case with a 77-year-old man claiming to be a scam victim in Sydney, Montana. The man told deputies that an unidentified person called and convinced him that his grandson had been arrested and needed bail money.

¡°Over the course of several days and phone calls, the victim was instructed to send over $20,000 to an address in Santa Clara,¡± police said.

Richland County investigators contacted Santa Clara police, which sent officers to the cash pickup location provided by the victim. Wednesday, officers secretly watching the spot saw Kotla pick up a package linked to the suspicious phone call, and arrested him.

The ensuing investigation into Kotla turned up more packages containing cash from three other presumed victims in California, police said. In total, officers recovered more than $28,000 in cash.

Investigators contend that Kotla was part of a larger group that preys on elderly people with an array of phone scams that have leveraged fears about issues including Medicare, prescription drugs, funerals, investments, lotteries, mortgages, the IRS and utilities.

Santa Clara police offered some precautionary measures people can take to help avoid becoming the victims of these kinds of schemes.

¡°Instead of engaging with someone who has contacted you, hang up and initiate a call to the companies you interact with via the phone number on your bill (or) statement,¡± police said in a news release. ¡°Residents are encouraged to be wary of phone calls where the caller is requesting money to be sent.¡±

Police also directed those looking for more information about elder scams to a web page by the California Attorney General¡¯s Office at oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/seniors.

MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. ? The Latest on charges brought against a New Jersey couple and a homeless man allegedly involved in charitable scam (all times local):

Authorities say a New Jersey couple and a homeless man made up a ¡°feel good¡± story about the man helping them so they could raise money through an online fundraiser.

Burlington County prosecutors outlined the allegations against Mark D¡¯Amico, Katelyn McClure and Johnny Bobbitt on Thursday. All three are charged with theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception.

The couple has claimed they set up a GoFundMe page for Bobbitt after he helped McClure get gas when she became stranded in Philadelphia last year. But prosecutors say they found evidence all three knew each other for at least a month before and set up the scheme.

D¡¯Amico and McClure surrendered Wednesday night. Their attorney said they have no comment. Bobbitt is jailed in Philadelphia. A previous lawyer of his didn¡¯t return a call seeking comment.

Authorities say a homeless man who benefited from a GoFundMe page set up by a New Jersey couple they said helped them with a disabled car has been arrested.

A Philadelphia prisons spokeswoman says Johnny Bobbitt was brought in Wednesday night by U.S. marshals and remained in custody Thursday on probation detainers and a $50,000 bond.

The development came as a New Jersey prosecutor planned to announce developments in a criminal investigation related to the fundraiser that raised $400,000 for Bobbitt.

The couple have denied any wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not answer a phone call.

The couple claim Bobbitt bought Katelyn McClure gas late one night when she was stranded in Philadelphia.

Bobbitt¡¯s lawyer says he has been told the money is gone. It¡¯s unclear what happened.

Older adults lose more than $36 billion every year to financial scams, according to a 2015 study. Unfortunately, con artists see the elderly population as an easy and vulnerable target.

Mike Rothman, president of the American Securities Administrators Association, told CNBC that scammers take this approach because the current elderly population is one of the wealthiest we¡¯ve seen with such hefty retirement savings. Where the money goes, the con artists follow.

With so many scams targeting older adults, it¡¯s essential to make yourself and your loved ones aware of the different types of cons. Here is a list of common financial scams that specifically target the elderly and how you can prevent them:

The grandparent scam is common because it appeals to older adults¡¯ emotions. Scammers get the phone number of a senior and they call pretending to be a grandchild. Making their lie seem more believable, the con artist will playfully ask the older adult to guess what grandchild is calling. Of course, the first reaction will most likely be for the senior to name a grandchild and then the scammer can easily play along, acting like they guessed right. Now the grandparent thinks they are talking to their grandchild.

Don¡¯t miss: How I got duped by a phishing scam

The scam artist will then begin to confide in the grandparent, saying they are in a tough financial position and they need the grandparent¡¯s help. Asking them to send money to a Western Union or MoneyGram, they plead for the grandparent not to tell anyone. If the grandparent complies and sends the money, the scammer will likely contact the senior again and ask for more money.
? Never send money to anyone unless you have 100% proof that it is who you think it is. Scammers can find out quite a bit of information from social media and other methods, so don¡¯t think that just because they know a couple pieces of information about you and your family that it is legit.
? Verify that it is actually your grandchild on the phone by texting or calling the grandchild¡¯s real phone number and verifying if it is him or her.
? Call the parent of the supposed grandchild and find out if the grandchild really is in trouble.
? Talk to your family members now and compile a list of questions only you and your family know the answers to. If a family emergency really does happen, you can ask the questions and know if it is your family member based on the answers.

The sweepstakes scam is when con artists contact the elderly either by phone or email and tell them they have won something, whether that be a sum of money or another type of prize. To claim the prize, scammers tell them they have to pay a fee. Once the senior agrees, scammers send a fake check in the mail. Before the check doesn¡¯t clear and seniors can realize it is a scam, they have already paid the ¡°fee.¡±
? Do not give out any financial information over the phone or email.
? Practice internet safety by protecting your passwords, shopping on encrypted websites, and avoiding phony emails.
? Be skeptical of any message that says you have randomly won a prize and you must do something before you can claim it. Unless you specifically enter a contest, you most likely aren¡¯t going to randomly win a monetary prize.

Because of the Affordable Care Act that allows seniors over the age of 65 to qualify for Medicare, scam artists don¡¯t have to do much research about seniors¡¯ health-care providers. This makes it simple for scammers to call, email, or even visit seniors¡¯ homes personally and claim to be a Medicare representative.

There are a variety of ways these con artists use this Medicare scam to target the elderly. One way is telling seniors they need a new Medicare card and to do so, they need to tell the ¡°Medicare representative¡± what their Social Security number is. An additional way is they can tell seniors there is a fee they need to pay to continue their benefits.
? Do not give out any information to someone you have not verified is from Medicare. Real Medicare employees should have your information on file so if you are skeptical, ask the person some questions to verify it is legitimate.

A common scam to target seniors who live alone is the ¡°woodchuck¡± scam. Scam artists will claim to be contractors and will complete house projects if seniors agree to let them.

The scammers will gain seniors¡¯ trust and eventually come up with a variety of fake repairs that need to be done, such as a roof repair. This often results in seniors giving the fake contractors thousands of dollars.
? Make sure the person doing your home repairs is a professional. Find out what company they work for and call and verify they are indeed a legitimate contractor.

Con artists are using senior homeownership to their benefit. The mortgage scam is when scammers offer a property assessment to seniors, telling them they can determine the value of their home. This scam has become increasing popular as housing confidence is hitting record highs and people are putting a large chunk of their income toward saving for new homes.

The scam artists make the process look legitimate by finding the home¡¯s information on the internet and sending seniors an official letter detailing all of the found information. The scammers do this because it is an easy way to con seniors into paying a fee for the requested information.
? Ensure the property assessment is legitimate by asking what company they work for and following up with the real company to verify.

Talk to your loved ones

Older adults are often too embarrassed to tell authorities or a family member they have been scammed. Talk to the seniors in your life and let them know they can confide in you and let you know if they have been scammed. You can also have them read through this article and make themselves aware of the scams that could potentially target them in the future.

Check your credit regularly so you are aware of any suspicious activity on your accounts.

Investigators with North Canton police received the initial complaint of a phone scam that occurred in the city on Wednesday.

Authorities received a call from a potential victim who said they were contacted by someone who identified themselves as "Detective Whitehouse" from the Stark County Sheriff's Office.

The caller told the victim that they failed to comply with a legal requirement of the sheriff's office and would need to purchase $2,000 in Google Play cards and provide the scammer with the card codes.

A number was given to the victim to call which duplicates the sheriff's office call system but is not connected to the department.

If you get a phone call from the Social Security Administration, officials from the Federal Trade Commission have some advice: Hang up.

The FTC has warned of a new "spoofing" scam, where scammers who call your phone mimic (or "spoof") the SSA's 1-800 customer service number to trick you into handing over personal information.

According to Lisa Weintraub Schifferle, an attorney with the FTC, the scam works like this:

When your phone rings, your caller ID shows it's the SSA calling from 1-800-772-1213. Then the caller says he or she is with the administration and needs your personal information (like your Social Security number) to increase your benefits or to prevent them from being cut off.

More: Charity call to 'Help the Vets' was a scam, and so were many others, says FTC

The 1-800 number is the SSA's real number, but the call is fake, Schifferle said in a release. The scammers are "spoofing" the number, essentially tricking your caller ID into making the call appear genuine.

Real SSA employees will never threaten you or promise to increase you benefits in exchange for information, she said.

If you get a call like this, hang up immediately.

If you are in doubt, hang up anyway and call the SSA back directly at itscustomer service line, Schifferle said.

More: Beware of these scams

"If you dial that number, you know who you're getting," she said.

If you receive a call you suspect is fake, FTC officials encourage you to report it to the SSA's Office of the Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271, or visit https://oig.ssa.gov/report. You can also report these calls to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.

Scammers calling people claiming they have won large cash prizes have upped their game ? and nearly cost one man Dh65,000 in the process.

British teacher Karl Marsden received a call by someone claiming to work for du on June 20 to say he had won Dh200,000.

Already familiar with similar scams, Mr Marsden was sceptical, so the "employee" proceeded to rattle off his personal details including his Emirates ID, passport and even his last dialled number from his existing du mobile phone account.

¡°Then he said I¡¯ll prove that I work for du. I¡¯ll put you on the diamond plan. I said ¡®what¡¯s the diamond plan?¡¯¡± a question the man did not answer, said Mr Marsden, who lives in Dubai.

The so-called employee proceeded to sign Mr Marsden up to the du diamond plan ? which comes with a Dh2,500 cancellation charge and Dh2,500 for every remaining month. That added up to Dh65,000 in Mr Marsden¡¯s case as it was applied to both his du mobile accounts.

The du "employee" then asked Mr Marsden for his card verification code number, the three-digit code on the signature strip on the reverse of bank cards.

¡°At that point I hung up,¡± he said.

¡°I had heard about this scam and I thought this was ridiculous but the fact was he had all my details was frightening.¡±

Dubai Police urge residents to report phone scams after increase in fraud cases

The latest mobile phone scam follows a warning issued by Dubai Police in June which called on residents to be vigilant about phone scams in the wake of a rise in the number of cases in which people lost ¡°hundreds of thousands of dirhams¡±.

Police said 33 fraudsters had been arrested in the previous two months for tricking people into transferring money they believed they had won. In one case, 19 Asian men were arrested in a raid by police in early June. The men were accused of repeatedly calling residents promising monetary rewards.

Mr Marsden reported the scam to du the same day he was almost conned.

¡°I went down to a du store and lodged a complaint. This lady came over and took photographs of my text messages,¡± said Mr Marsden.

¡°She said 'what has happened is we have had a falling out with a company and they have taken all our data and they are using it'. But why would a hack do that? Why would he put me on the diamond plan?¡±

The du employee did not give him a complaint number but told him not to worry, assured that they were aware of the scam and the cancellation charges for the two diamond plans would be waived.

After not hearing anything for two weeks, Mr Marsden visited another du store for an update on the case.

¡°Another guy opened a file case in Mall of the Emirates and he said ¡®don¡¯t worry, it will all be sorted out¡¯.

¡°So I went away back to England and then I got this Dh65,000 bill to cancel the diamond plan in the summer.¡±

Mr Marsden lodged several complaints with the telecoms Regulatory Authority about the case and was subsequently told by the department that he would not be charged the cancellation fee for the diamond plans.

Until this week, four months on, the charge remained on his account. But after being contacted by The National about the case, du got in touch with Mr Marsden on Monday to confirm that the charges will now be cancelled.

du said Mr Marsden was signed up to the diamond plan "to a result of communication between the customer and a third party." The company said he reported the matter on July 3, rather than on June 20 as Mr Marsden claimed.

"We have reached out to the client and have settled upon a mutually-amicable resolution - both numbers belonging to the customer will be reactivated in due course," du said.

He is relieved, but said it should never have gone on so long.

¡°Du didn¡¯t handle it appropriately. They should have said ¡®sorry, this shouldn¡¯t have happened¡¯. I have been a customer with du for six years,¡± he said.

¡°I actually also invoiced du for Dh200,000. I said you owe me Dh200,000 because you said I won that. Funnily enough, I haven¡¯t heard back about that.¡±

Last month, The National reported how another du customer, David Tobias, had been charged Dh65,000 to cancel a contract he said he was signed up to in error. du agreed to waive the Dh65,000 charge, but Mr Tobias said the company still want him to pay for the VAT on the amount. He was cut off again this week after being reconnected last month.

Du advised customers to report suspicious offers or promotions directly to them or police.

Dubai Police and the TRA were contacted for comment.

An Edmonton couple is out $175, and say it could have been thousands of dollars, after falling victim to what¡¯s known as the fat finger scam. Sharon and Yves Baril are sharing their story in hopes of warning others.

On Monday afternoon, Sharon, 64, called the customer service number on the back of her Scotiabank bank card in hopes of getting information about her account balance.

The person on the other end of the line told her she had won a cruise to Bermuda for being a loyal bank customer; Yves, 71, has held the account since he was 18.

¡°Somebody answers saying, ¡®Congratulations, you just won a cruise.¡¯ All fancy and everything,¡± Sharon said. ¡°They made it sound so good.¡±

Sharon gave the person her bank card number and the number on the back of her card. But then, the person on the other end of the phone continued to sweeten ¡°the deal.¡± They said for an extra $1,200 they could stay for another two weeks.

The couple said they asked their son to help them check their bank balance online, but within minutes of hanging up the phone, $175 was gone. Yves immediately went to the bank where he was told he had fallen victim to a scam.

¡°They said, ¡®No, there¡¯s no promotion for that,'¡± Yves explained.

¡°They told me I wasn¡¯t the only one. I go to the same girl all the time, the teller, and she said I¡¯m not the only one, she said it¡¯s been going on a couple days now.¡±

The scam is referred to as ¡°fat finger dialing.¡± Scammers are buying up phone numbers similar to the customer support lines of major companies in hopes of fooling customers who have misdialled, according to the Better Business Bureau.

The scammer on the other end of the line offers free giveaways, such as prizes and gift cards. Because the customer has dialled the number themselves, they assume the gift offer must be the real deal so they stay on the line to speak to the representative.

The BBB said scammers will often ask for personal information such as your name, address and banking or credit card information in order to process the gift. Scammers are impersonating a wide range of organizations from banking and credit institution, to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to Walmart.

Watch below: The Better Business Bureau is warning consumers about some of the top scams making the rounds this fall.

Seanna Lawrence, president and CEO of the BBB in central and northern Alberta, said the scam has been prevalent in North America for the past couple of years. While her BBB location hasn¡¯t received any recent local reports of the scam, she said it isn¡¯t uncommon.

If people suspect the offer is too good to be true, Lawrence encourages them to hang up the phone. If it¡¯s a legitimate offer, they can always call back. In addition, she said to keep an ear out for offers that are more than just nominal rewards.

¡°A cruise is a great example because that is something that¡¯s exorbitant,¡± she said. ¡°Or if there¡¯s a 50 per cent discount, some kind of massive discount or reward, that¡¯s the best indicator that you should do some further research.¡±

Lawrence said companies that are being targeted will often have alerts posted on their websites. She said people should never give out their credit card or banking information because their institution would already have that information.

Scotiabank would not say if the bank has been hit by this particular scam recently or how many people may have been affected by the scam.

¡°The number and sophistication of phishing and fraud attempts have increased globally,¡± Scotiabank spokesperson Brynne Moore said in a statement.

¡°The safety and security of our customers and their accounts are a top priority for the bank. No bank is immune to these threats and both the customer and the bank have responsibilities to protect their information. We encourage our customers to report any suspicious activity immediately to the bank, as well as to the appropriate authorities.¡±

Officials say the suspects are calling people and saying they have kidnapped the victim¡¯s child, even threatening murder if the victim is not compliant.

¡°We were advised that these calls may be originating out of Mexico,¡± said authorities.

The caller will give the victims directions on how to send the money to a location in Mexico for the suspects to retrieve it.

¡°Unfortunately, this department was just involved in such a hoax. Very unnerving for the parents and law enforcement.¡±

The FBI is working with agencies at this time to locate the suspects.

The call centres behind those fake CRA calls have been raided. It follows our investigation that revealed where many of the scammers were operating. In one of the facilities, police found details on more than 600 Canadian victims. RCMP will contact them to find out how much was stolen and whether there is any prospect of getting the money back.

Why does Stats Can need your banking info?

Statistics Canada has been asking banks across the country for your financial information, and that's prompted the privacy commissioner to launch a probe. The agency says the data is for research on the housing market and debt levels, and there are no privacy violations.

Canada's two biggest telecoms say they don't tolerate misleading sales tactics. Their defence to the CRTC came after hundreds of telecom employees told CBC's Go Public about aggressive attempts to get customers to sign up for new services. Hundreds of customers have also complained since the regulator started public consultations.

We're back on the case investigating the dark side of high-tech home security systems. Ferial Nejim says her ex-partner used smart home technology to harass her. She says she contacted local police, but was told nothing could be done because her ex-partner owned the home.

What else is going on?

American Apparel returns to Canada with an online store. One year after its bankruptcy and closure, the brand is now Canadian-owned and won't have any physical stores.

Hungry squirrels go nuts over Ottawa man's Honda. Lenard Broadhead says rodents gnawed on the biodegradable parts on his eco-friendly car.

RCMP victimized by $100,000 credit card cloning scam. The police force has changed its procedures after organized criminals cloned one of their gas credit cards and the fraud went undetected for months.

Chinese phone maker Xiaomi is in damage-control mode after an online promotion coinciding with its big UK launch somewhat backfired.

The plan was to offer handsets for just a quid in Blighty, when a countdown on its UK website reached zero, with the impression being that if you clicked soon after the timer ran out, you'd be able to snap up a pretty decent phone on the cheap. Thousands of people eagerly piled in, but were disappointed. The offer was too good to be true. When the countdown hit zero, the Xiaomi website reported all of the ¡Ì1 units were out of stock.

Now some people, technical folks loving a bargain, had set up multiple web accounts to try and get hold of the cheap Chinese kit. When everyone seemingly struck out, these savvy netizens got suspicious, and one bright spark decided to dig a little deeper into the offer. It appeared, from the public-facing website code, that no attempt was made by the JavaScript to check for whether or not stock was available: when the timer hit zero, hopefuls were simply told, sorry, there are no mega-discounted handsets. You'll just have to pay the full price.

It thus appeared the website was hard-coded to reject attempts to buy the offered ¡Ì1 phones, leading some to assume it was all a scam to generate hype and publicity. So we asked Xiaomi what was going on. Its UK marketing boss got back to us:

In other words, this isn't a scam nor a bug, but a feature, of sorts. It was a lottery, not a special offer. Get a load of people looking at the site, get them to compete for a bargain device per day, pick just a few lucky winners at random, and it's done. How do we know this? As well as the above explanation, Xiaomi actually stated it in the terms and conditions of the promotion, which were linked to at the bottom of the page:

So there you have it: 10 phones for the 60 million people of the UK to fight over. Understandably, some British buyers were a little peeved: if it was a lottery, it should have said so. People thought it was a first-come, first-served special discount, with a decent stockpile of gear up for grabs, when really it was nothing of the sort. It was a raffle draw.

Of course, if a biz is offering you a new smartphone for a quid, you might well assume stocks are limited or some other catch applies. In this case, there was a catch: there were only a few devices available during each offer-slash-giveaway. One might say it's not entirely unreasonable to expect a phone maker to only offer a few devices at ¡Ì1. Anything else is commercial suicide.

The biz has since apologized, though, for the confusion, insisting it was a lost-in-translation blunder. Here's the official statement we got on Monday:

The promotion was originally named ¡®Crazy Deal¡¯ and would make a total of 10 Xiaomi smartphones available in the UK for ¡Ì1. The devices were to be distributed in four phases at four time slots. In each time slot, a total of three, three, two and then finally another two devices were included. Before launch however, concerned about the vagueness and potentially negative connotations of the term ¡°Crazy Deal¡±, we changed the name of the promotion to ¡°Flash Sale¡±. Unfortunately, we did not realise that the public associates this term with a very particular type of deal Xiaomi has run for in the past across different global markets, where more than 10 devices were available. This has led to concern on social media that the terms of the UK flash deal were unclear, and/or that the devices were not available for ¡Ì1 as promised. We can confirm that 10 customers have received discount codes which will allow them to purchase a Xiaomi device for ¡Ì1. Of the thousands who clicked ¡®buy¡¯ simultaneously, our system will randomly select the winners, and he or she will be able to add this item to the shopping cart and pay this handset at ¡Ì1. We¡¯re sorry so many of our Mi fans missed out this time round, but we hope they¡¯ll take part in future flash sales as and when we announce them. @XiaomiUK would like to apologise for any misunderstanding. For future deals, we will take into account the need for clarity and differentiating in promotions we are running.

We'll be watching to see if the promotion results in any complaints to the regulators: the Advertising Standards Agency or local Trading Standards. ¢ç

ROCKVILLE, MD ? Montgomery County police are warning residents about a phone scam in which callers pretend to be Pepco employees and ask for money.

In one incident on Oct. 30, a scammer ? who claimed to work for the utility company ? told a resident he was behind on his utility bill, officials said. The scammer told the resident he could pay the bill over the phone by getting a prepaid debit card and relaying the debit card's information over the phone.

The Cumberland County District Attorney's Office has received several reports from residents getting phone calls from people claiming to be the IRS, the office said Thursday. They DA's office warns these are scams.

The caller claims that the resident is under investigation, and threatens arrest, fines, freezing of accounts and more if the resident doesn't make a payment, investigators said.

The caller ID could show a phone number from Washington DC, the IRS or other law enforcement, investigators said.

"These calls are not legitimate, and not the way the IRS conducts business," the DA's office said in a release. "Residents are advised not to provide account or payment information over the phone."

Anyone concerned that a call may not be legitimate is encouraged to call local police for assistance.

The IRS also has a tipsheet about scams that can be viewed on their website.

The Boston University Police Department warned students Thursday afternoon about an international phone fraud scheme targeting Asian students on its Charles River campus.

The department sent an alert to students at about 4:50 p.m. notifying them of three incidents that have been reported since Oct. 12. ¡°All three appear to involve similar themes and are clearly targeting our Asian student population,¡± the department said in a statement on their website.

¡°These appear to be part of a much larger scheme, which has been perpetrated over the last several months in cities such as New York, Boston, San Francisco, Houston, Los Angeles, as well as in Canada and Australia,¡± BU police said in the statement.

On Nov. 2, a BU student was convinced to transfer $49,000 in separate payments using an online payment platform relating to Bank of China, according to the statement.

The student received a pre-recorded phone call of a female voice speaking in a Chinese dialect and claiming to be from the DHL package delivery company, The student was then transferred to a man claiming to be a Shanghai police officer.

This person accused the student of dealing in fake credit cards and requested the money transfers.

The fake call followed two other calls targeting BU students in October.

A student on Oct. 12 received a call from DHL and was connected to a person who claimed to be a Chinese customs agent accusing the student of using fake credit cards.

The student sent $5,500 using the same payment platform.

On Oct. 24, another student received a similiar phone call and was convinced to share personal information, but did not transfer any money.

The suspect has also sent photos of a person in uniform in order to convince the student of their status, the department said.

He is most likely located overseas and could be operating with others.

He will also threaten students with the cancelation of their visas if they refuse to comply, and tells them they may not speak to anyone about the transaction.

The scheme is meant to capitalize on international students¡¯ fear of not cooperating with the government, campus police said , and assured those students that they are not obligated to speak with them or transfer any money.

The department also provided tips from the Federal Trade Commission on avoiding fraud.

The incidents are under investigation by the Boston University Police Detective Unit.

Anyone with information should contact the BUPD at 617-353-2121, or report anonymously by texting ¡°BU¡± to 847411.

Hawai¡®i Electric Companies reports that residents and small businesses are losing thousands of dollars to increasingly aggressive thieves and scam artists posing as utility workers and bill collectors. As part of national Utility Scam Awareness Week, local utilities, police and consumer experts are joining forces to prevent customers from being scammed.

The Hawaiian Electric Companies, Hawaiian Telcom, Hawai¡®i Gas, Board of Water Supply and Kaua¡®i Island Utility Cooperative have partnered with the state Office of Consumer Protection and Honolulu Police Department to combat scammers who target utility customers. Customers need to be alert and recognize scams, especially when criminals threaten to disconnect service unless a payment is made.

¡°Unfortunately, scammers are always looking for potential victims, and the utility scam is one of the common ruses,¡± said Honolulu Police Deputy Chief John McCarthy. ¡°Whenever you receive a phone call or email or letter that sounds suspicious or out of the ordinary, always check with the organization or business before making any payment or giving out personal financial information. You don¡¯t want criminals to get your hard earned money.¡±

Scammers are targeting customers who rely on vital services such as electricity, water, gas and telecommunications. And utilities often see a spike in scams during the holidays.

The utilities offer the following tips:
? If the caller says your utility account is delinquent and threatens to shut off service immediately unless payment is made, it¡¯s a scam.
? If someone calls from a utility demanding immediate payment over the phone, via money transfer, prepaid debit cards or by Bitcoin, it¡¯s a scam.
? If the caller asks to meet the customer in person to pick up a payment, it¡¯s a scam.
? If you receive an email from your utility urging you to click on an embedded link or attachment to resolve a utility issue or pay a bill, think before you click. It¡¯s likely a scam.
? If a utility worker shows up at your home or place of business, ensure that person is wearing official attire with a logo, driving a properly labeled vehicle and carrying company identification. When in doubt, call the utility¡¯s customer service center.

Some people in the Greater Morgantown Area have been getting some interesting calls over the last week.

Scam artists, now posing as one of the Monongalia County Sheriff's Office's own deputies. Deputy Bise, but it's not the real Deputy Bise.

"Some of the victims were called and said that this was Deputy Bise, which we do have a deputy name Bise, and that they missed jury duty and they needed to pay a fine," said Sheriff Perry Palmer.

Palmer says phone scams typically come in cycles and when a new one comes along people need to be aware.

He says this time, someone fell victim.

"One person that did report it to us did go get them money and they were able to con him," said Palmer.

These scammers are asking you to get a green dot card, put money on it and to call back with the pin number.

When scammers get someone to do this, it's their lucky day.

"These people, if they can get two or three people out of 100 calls to actually give them some money, then they've had a good day," said Palmer.

This is the first time Palmer has heard of someone using a deputy's name and they're calling about a range of things.

"Missing jury duty to your loved one needs bail money to you have a warrant or citation," said Palmer.

Police departments do not solicit for tickets or warrants. Anything like this will go through the court system.

Palmer also says nine times out of ten, the people can't be traced down because they use disposable phones.

He says, people just need to be cautious.

"Do not give out any money. Don't give out any personal information. Hang up and call your local agency," said Palmer.

OXFORD TOWNSHIP ? Eastern Adams Regional Police are warning residents of a potential phone scam after an elderly resident of the Brethren Home in Oxford Township was recently victimized.

According to police, the crime was reported by the victim¡¯s son, who said his mother was contacted by a man purporting to be a member of an unidentified police department on October 19.

The suspect told the victim her grandson was involved in an accident in New Jersey, had been arrested, and needed bail money. Another man, who identified himself as a public defender, contacted the victim a few minutes later, instructing her to go to Home Depot, put $2,000 on a gift card, and provide him with the card number to transfer the funds, which he said was bail money for the victim¡¯s grandson.

The victim did as she was instructed. She was then contacted again later in the day by a man claiming he needed an additional $2,900. This time, the victim refused, police say.

Later in the day, the victim called her son, who contacted the victim¡¯s grandson and confirmed that he had not been in New Jersey and was not involved in any car accident.

The victim provided two phone numbers to police. The first was an untraceable 877 number, police say. The second is believed to be a burner phone number from a Lynchburg, VA area code.

Eastern Adams Regional Police are advising all residents not to fall victim of this type of scam. Police Departments do not contact any individuals for bail money. Most importantly, if anyone asks for payment to be made by a gift card, Walmart Card, Home Depot card, etc., this is the telltale sign of a classic fraud, police say. No government agency ever accepts nor requires this type of payment.

A recent jail sentencing in a phone scam operation may have put a dent in what has become a rival to the drug trade as one of Jamaica's most lucrative criminal enterprises.

Last week, U.S. prosecutors reached a major milestone when Lavrick Willocks, an alleged kingpin in the scam, was sentenced to six years in federal prison and ordered to pay $1.5 million US in restitution.

According to a local Jamaican news outlet, Willocks faced up to 40 years in prison but prosecutors agreed to a lighter sentence because he co-operated with authorities.

The scammers generally target people, particularly seniors, by telling them they've won a lottery prize in the millions of dollars. All they need to do is pay a processing fee to claim their prize.

The FBI believes there are hundreds of victims, including Canadians.
? CBC News: 'You don't want to tell anybody': Winnipeg senior describes scam ordeal

Agnes Frechette of Winnipeg was one such victim. She ended up losing her life savings, after sending them a total of $6,000 Cdn via Western Union.

"[The man on the phone] said that I was not listening to him and I never came back with the money fast enough for him. So he was going to punish me," she told CBC Winnipeg.

"You find yourself getting weaker every day, and you don't want to tell anybody because it's so, so embarrassing."

Jessica Gunson, an acting manager at the Canadian Anti-fraud Centre in North Bay, Ont., says she hears stories like Frechette's every day.

"I think a common trend with victims of fraud is that they are embarrassed or ashamed that they've fallen for the scam and they don't know who to turn to," she told The Current's guest host David Common.

She said the chances of victims getting their money back are "slim." More recently, fraudsters may request payments in bitcoin, making it more difficult for investigators to track the cryptocurrency payments.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O'Konek prosecuted Willocks, and worked closely with the FBI to uncover the case that spanned five U.S. states.

He said fraudsters find potential victims by using "lead lists" ? databases usually used by legitimate telemarketers with information on potential or likely customers.

"Once you pay that initial part of what they think is a fee, they believe so strongly that they will continue to give more and more, because they have already essentially put so much money in," O'Konek told Common.

He added that the scams often target elderly people, who may be less tech-savvy. The scammers may also warn victims that their prize money will be lost if they tell anyone else about their supposed winnings.

Jovan Scott Lewis, a professor of African-American studies in geography at the University of California in Berkeley, has been studying the lottery scamming industry and community in Montego Bay, Jamaica ? where he's originally from.

He told Common that when these types of phone scams grew to prominence around 2012, some of the scammers saw what they were doing as "a form of reparations for slavery, and for the many years of colonialism."

Some coveted the middle-class lifestyle they saw from North American or European tourists who flooded Jamaican beaches in the winter.

A moderately get-rich-quick scheme, like taking part in phone scam operations, offered them a measure of that lifestyle to themselves.

"As a middle income country, and especially in Montego Bay having the kind of regular tourist encounter, there is a kind of familiarity with Western wealth that makes a kind of ambition for that kind of lifestyle a very common experience," he said.

"And so there is a knowledge as to what lifestyle could be had. And because many of the call centres and the access to the victims, it made it quite possible."

ATLANTA - You may want to think twice before letting a stranger borrow your cell phone.

Atlanta Police have received reports from people saying they were scammed out of thousands of dollars after letting someone use their phone.

Since September, four people have contacted police with similar stories. They were approached by someone who asked to borrow their cell phone to make a call. Later, three of the victims received notifications from their bank alerting them of the transactions. In each case, money was sent from their cell phones to another party using the cash sharing app Venmo.

On September 18, a 28-year old woman left Woody's CheeseSteaks located on Monroe Drive. She told police she was approached by a man who asked to use her cell phone to contact a friend and tell them where he was located.

Later that day, she received a fraud alert from her bank for two transactions; one for $1,000 and another for $500. She told police the suspect was a young light skin African-American male who had short locs with blonde tips. He was wearing a green bomber jacket with letters, no shirt underneath and shorts. He was last seen in a red car with Mississippi plates.

On October 4, a 26-year old man was walking home from Inman Perk Coffee Shop when a man approached him saying he had an emergency and asked to borrow his phone because his was dead.

The man told police the thief made a call then sent a text because he said the person didn't answer. He received an email from his bank saying he had insufficient funds from three transactions of $1,000, $500, and $1,000. No description of a suspect was giving in the report.

Another 28-year-old woman said she was at the corner of 8th and Cypress Streets on October 11 when a well-dressed African-American teenager riding a scooter approached her. He asked to borrow her phone to call his friend because he was lost. After pretending to call and text someone, she said he asked her for directions to the nearest MARTA station. The next morning, she got an overdraft protection alert for a $1,000 and another for $1,500.

And on October 25, a woman said she let a black male use her phone while she was on the Beltline near Ralph McGill Blvd. She later realized he sent $1,500 to someone using the Venmo app.

Atlanta Police have not made an arrest in these cases and gives the following tips for people to help protect themselves:
? Keep any personal and financial information secure on your phone.
? Avoid using an auto login feature on any that app that contains sensitive information.

2018 has been the year of scams, to say the least. From fake CRA calls and emails to cloning credit cards, Canadians have had to be more vigilant than ever when it comes to protecting their funds. Unfortunately, the latest scam is the sneakiest, as it comes as a result of people attempting to call their own bank's service numbers, and not realizing it isn't their bank who is answering the phone.

The news of this scam came after an Edmonton couple fell victim to it. The victim, named Sharon, decided to call her bank's customer service in order to know what the balance on her account was. She dialed the number listed on the back of her card and when a person answered, they claimed she had won a cruise as a result of being such a loyal customer.

Her husband Yves had the account since he was 18 years old, so Sharon believed it was legit, telling Global News "they made it sounds so good." The offer was that everything on the cruise was paid for except for the flights to Florida and a $130 deposit on the room and food.

After Sharon accepted the offer and gave her credit card information over the phone, assuming she was talking to a bank employee, the next thing the "customer service representative" said made her husband realize she had made a terrible mistake.

It was after she gave her bank information that the "customer service representative" said they could "sweeten the deal," offering another two weeks onto the cruise if they paid an extra $1200. It was then that Yves realized his wife was being scammed saying "when they said $1200 bucks I said, 'No, no, no, I shook my head. I told my wife, 'Hang up, it's a scam.'"

Sure enough, by the time the couple was able to check online what their bank balance was, $175 had gone missing within the time she had hung up the phone and gotten to her computer. Thankfully, the pair was able to get to a bank location in enough time to freeze the account before more money was taken out. There they learned from bank employees that the scam was becoming a common occurrence for customers.

If you are still trying to figure out how a scammer picked up the phone instead of the bank's customer service if Sharon called the number on the back of her card, it's because she had made a typo in the number when dialling.

Scammers are purposely buying up phone numbers that are similar to popular bank customer service numbers in hopes people will make a mistake and think they are on the phone with their bank.

The scam is known as the "Fat Finger Phone Scam" and is definitely a dangerous one, considering most people don't think twice about dialling their bank and immediately assuming the person on the other end is a customer service representative. Especially considering that those conversations usually involve giving your personal and banking information, it's the perfect opportunity for scammers to get your information.

Meaning the next time you have to call customer service, you are definitely going to want to double check the number before you give out any of your personal information. Or if you are really worried, just go to a bank location in person for assistance!

The Cedar Rapids Police Department is alerting residents of a scam they received reports of this morning.

Police say the scam involves phone calls to residents where the person on the phone claims $2,000 has been removed from the recipient's bank account.

The scammer then tells the resident they need to call a number to have the money returned.

Police say residents shouldn't call the number back. They also want to remind people not to give out personal or financial information.

Residents who are called by the scammer should contact their credit card company or financial institution directly to verify the account hasn't been compromised.

A phone scam in the South West is leading residents to believe they have been contacted by the Cyber Crime Unit.

The agency has issued a warning about the scam, which misleads people into thinking their internet service has been "compromised" and will be shut down.

The South West Cyber Crime Unit tweeted: "We've had a report that criminals are pretending to be us and carrying out automated scam calls.

"The call says that your Internet has been compromised and will be shut down within 24 hours, and if you want to speak to a technical team you should 'press 1'.

"This is a scam, if you do receive a call like this, hang up the phone immediately."

The agency says they do not operate an automated call service.

If the Cyber Crime Unit does need to contact someone by phone, they provide verification that it is genuine, such as a collar number which can be given to a 101 call handler.

Anyone who thinks they may have been affected by the scam is asked to contact Action Fraud UK online or by phone at 0300 123 2040.

CENTREVILLE, Md. ? The Queen Anne¡¯s County Sheriff¡¯s Office is warning residents of a potential telephone scam in the area.

According to the Sheriff¡¯s office, the caller will claim to be a deputy that is employed by the QA Sheriff¡¯s office, telling the victim that there¡¯s an outstanding warrant out for their arrest. During the call, the scammer will attempt to obtain personal and financial information from the victim, and may attempt to intimidate them by stating that police are on their way to arrest them if they don¡¯t agree to pay a particular fee.

The Sheriff¡¯s office wants to inform residents that they will never make notifications of warrants via telephone, and will never ask for any type of payment to expel a warrant.

If you would like to verify if an individual has an active warrant, you can view the most wanted section of the Sheriff¡¯s office website here, or call 410-758-0770.

ELKTON ? Delmarva Power and the Elkton Police Department are getting the word out about a telephone scam after at least one person reported receiving a fraudulent call Wednesday.

"Fortunately the person was head's up on this," said Capt. Joseph Zurolo, EPD spokesman. "He did not do it. He knew it was hanky."

The caller told police ? and also the utility ? that he received a call from someone claiming to represent Delmarva Power just before 2 p.m.

"They said he had a late payment of over $1,000," Zurolo said. "He was told to go to Acme and buy a prepaid credit card."

Scammers then tell their victim to call back and give the card account information so the thief then has access to the funds.

"A utility representative is never going to require a customer to pay a past due with a prepaid card," said Timothy Stokes, spokesman for Delmarva Power.

Furthermore, he said DPL will never give its customers just one notice before a shutoff occurs.

"Customers will receive multiple shutoff notices," he said of the company policy. "We work to remedy the situation."

Since it was the first such report in a while, Zurolo took it as an opportunity to post a release issued earlier in the day from DPL warning about the potential for telephone scams.

"They're very brazen," he said of the scammers, noting they are difficult to track and prosecute.

Police are running the phone number and other information just the same.

Stokes said anyone who receives one of these calls should follow the Elkton resident's response and call law enforcement and the utility. Ironically, Wednesday was also "Utilities United Against Scams Day," part of a weeklong campaign embraced by DPL, Exelon and other utilities nationwide.

"It's an opportunity to provide education and insight to our customers," Stokes said Thursday.

Stokes said there are red flags customers should remember to protect themselves including the mood of the scammer, who will become angry and threaten the potential victim. Scammers will also give the victim a very short window to make the payment, which is another sign of fraudulent intentions.

First and foremost, he said customers should call 1-800-375-7117 and let DPL know such a call has been received.

Utilities are not the only companies being spoofed by scam operations. Law enforcement across Maryland report incidents where callers have received threat of arrest for failure to pay a court cost, or for failure to appear for jury duty. In these incidents there is also the urgent need to buy a prepaid card and give that information to the scammer.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, 26 percent of telephone scams reported use this type of ruse, up from 7 percent in 2015. In an October 2018 report at FTC.gov's Consumer Protection site, these prepaid cards are the perfect foil for criminals.

"Con artists favor these cards because they can get quick cash, the transaction is largely irreversible, and they can remain anonymous," the report reads.

Scammers also manage to scare people into using a variety of payment cards including iTunes and Google Play, directing their victim to nationally known chain stores including Walgreens, Target, Walmart and CVS.

According to the FTC, this type of crime caused consumers to lose $40 million in 2017, compared to $27 million the year before. On average, scammers now get $959 from each victim. That's a 60 percent increase from 2017.

It's that time again, time to talk about the IRS scam call. You may have heard about it but not everyone has, and I know this because 2WTK gets calls every week about it! One couple reached out to our TEGNA Verify team after they received two phone calls in a day and the couple really feared they owed back taxes and were going to jail.

THE IRS DOES NOT:

Call you at home out of the blue.

Threaten immediate jail time or arrest without payment.

Take payment in any kind of gift card.

Verify any correspondence by you calling the IRS number on the website.

You can let the IRS know you got the scam call or the NC Attorney General's office. But what you really need to do, is just delete the message, don't pick up the phone if you don't recognize the number or don't engage when you get the call.

Moranbah Police report a scam caller who called the office more than once.

Moranbah Police report a scam caller who called the office more than once. Kevin Farmer

POLICE have issued a scam alert after a person pretending to be from Telstra Technical Support called Moranbah station in an attempt to persuade them to hand over sensitive information and money.

Senior Constable Steve Smith said an officer at the station received a direct phone call from a person who claimed to be from a phone company.

"The scam caller attempted to persuade the police officer in question that there was an internet connection technical issue which only he could fix - remotely and at a cost of course," Snr Const Smith said.

"It was clearly explained to the scam caller that he may have poorly selected his target on that day.

"Once the penny dropped, our scam caller tried a different tact and began to communicate his point using only obscene language."

Snr Const Smith said after the caller hung up, he called the station a second time.

"They called back once again to explain their thoughts and opinions on law enforcement globally, using the same obscene communication method to highlight their ideas," he said.

In this example, the officer did not allow the caller remote access to the computer so no money or sensitive information was stolen.

Snr Const Smith said residents need to stay aware as this is not always the case.

"Police received a further report from a local retired resident of Beaconsfield who received the same style of call from a phone scammer on November 2," he said.

"In these circumstances, she did lose money, many thousands of dollars in fact and sensitive information was indeed compromised."

Staff in mobile phone shops have become key to the execution of "Sim swap" scams, Watchdog Live has discovered.

Undercover filming revealed that O2 and Vodafone employees are bypassing basic ID checks and handing over replacement Sim cards to potential criminals.

Once fraudsters gain control of a mobile number, they can intercept SMS text messages from banks containing security codes.

Scammers have drained thousands of pounds from victims' bank accounts.

O2 told the BBC it currently only asks for photo ID when replacing Sims on a monthly contract, and that customers on Pay As You Go contracts would always receive an authorisation code alerting them that someone is trying to access their number.

However, that did not happen with any of the numbers being used by the Watchdog Live team, who were able to walk out with a replacement Sim in almost every case.

O2 says it did send out authorisation codes, but they were not received by the victims' smartphones.

Vodafone said that it takes Sim swap fraud "extremely seriously" and that it is disappointed that two of its employees did not follow established security check procedures, despite being given mandatory training, reinforced by regular reminders to the contrary.

Previously, in some countries, Sim swap scams were used by scammers to ring and text premium numbers to run up large mobile phone bills.

But now that more online services use two-factor authentication, which requires text messages to be sent to mobile phones, there is more at risk.

Olga from Buckinghamshire had ¡Ì2,000 taken from her bank account, after a fraudster managed to successfully request a replacement Sim for her mobile number without her knowing anything about it.

"It was like a state of shock and my first thought was that there must be some sort of error," Olga told Watchdog. "I was just sobbing down the phone saying all my money's been stolen."

Initially, Olga's bank refused to refund her the money, blaming her for not keeping her details safe.

But it eventually became clear that the fraudster had found a way in to her account after being given a replacement Sim card by EE.

Watchdog's undercover visits found that staff in EE and Three stores always stuck to their security policies by demanding photo ID.

Sim swap scams occur when a criminal is able to convince a mobile operator to issue them with a replacement Sim card, by claiming a false identity and pretending that their mobile phone has been either lost or stolen.

Criminals are able to do this using people's personal details that have been stolen using malware or cyber-attacks. Many of these details are then sold on the dark web.

The victim's Sim card stops working and the criminal can then access any online service that requires security codes to be sent to a user's mobile phone.

Security researchers have long believed that UK crime gangs are behind these scams, as the fraudsters manage to trick banks by logging onto mobile banking systems from locations close to the victim's home address.

In the past, this scam has been perpetrated by fraudsters calling the customer service call centres of mobile operators, as well as by hackers using fake mobile base station equipment bought from the black market.

While the scam has been in existence for at least four years - BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme demonstrated that they could attack bank accounts in 2016 - the number of cases of Sim swap fraud have rocketed by 60% since 2016.

There's an emergency scam, also known as the "Grandparent Scam," that targets well-meaning senior citizens who think they are helping a grandchild in distress.

Typically, the grandparent receives a frantic phone call from someone they are led to believe is their grandchild.

President/CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Acadiana, Sharane Gott, says, "When somebody calls you out of the blue usually in the middle of the night early morning they're calling you at that time on purpose to get you off guard.. not think. They want you reacting and they want you to do it right away and it's high pressure. And ¡®oh my god it's my grandchild,¡¯ well, it's not probably."

Experts say senior citizens are frequent targets of scammers because they are often trusting and quickly willing to help a loved one.

"So let me tell you about robocalls,¡± adds Gott. ¡°What robocalls is basically a computer that calls these numbers as soon as somebody answers it switches to a person so what happens is the computer is making the robotic calls."

The scammer, posing as the "grandchild," asks for thousands of dollars to be wired to them for reasons including posting bail, repairing the grandchild's car, or even paying hospital bills after a car accident.

News 10 reports, "So when we're talking about this particular of a scam how do these scammers know which people to essentially target?"

"Well, you can buy lists of senior citizens. We won't call them the elderly. We'll call them senior citizens. Like anybody on AARP and any lists like AARP or somebody over 50," explains Gott.

News 10 reports, "So what can people do to prevent this scam from happening to them?"

Gott says, "If you get one of these phone calls in the middle of the night, which is what they like to do, one of the things you need to remember is not to be high pressured."

Robokiller is an app that intercepts scam and spam calls and uses "bots" to waste the time of the callers. It won a competition by the Federal Trade Commission.

Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) - Monroe County's 585 area code is among the most targeted in the country by scam and spam callers. More than 15,500,000 of these calls were placed in September 2018 alone, adding up to 32 calls a month per person.

The U.S. average is 20.

A 13WHAM investigation found reasons why 'Do Not Call' registries are not effective - in part, because many of these organizations operate illegally and don't care about the rules legitimate telemarketers must follow.

But what if you could get rid of the calls? Better yet, what if you could turn the tables and annoy the scammers for a change?

Small business owner Bryan Maslin estimates he receives between four and eight of these calls every day.

"While I was doing this interview with you, I got another call," Maslin said, holding up his cell phone.

Scammers trick people into turning over money or credit cards and rake in a whopping $9.5 billion in revenue every year. They often operate overseas and frequently change numbers to avoid detection.

"These guys aren't trying to follow the law or honor a list the government put out there," said Ethan Garr, VP of products for Robokiller. "There's no single solution from the government or regulator or carrier."

Robokiller is an app. It identifies and blocks more than a million numbers known to be used to make these annoying calls. It also identifies scammers through voice recognition technology and can block calls when the caller IDs are spoofed.

Here's the best part: When callers interrupt your day, Robokiller interrupts theirs.

"Our robots talk back to scammers and waste their time," said Garr. You can choose from more than a dozen "bots" - including one with a Russian accent or even one that imitates President Trump.

"We don't just want to block their calls, we want to disrupt their whole business," said Garr. "That's time they can't use to call someone else or scam someone's elderly mother."

Robokiller won a competition by the Federal Trade Commission. For $24.99 a year, it promises to reduce spam and scam calls by up to 90 percent and does so within three months.

CHARLESTON ? West Virginia residents should be cautious of scams involving people pretending to work for utility companies, according to the state Public Service Commission.

Commission officials said in a release that several such scams have been reported recently throughout the state. The scams take many forms, including a person claiming to be from a company coming to a customer¡¯s house, a phone call or an email.

The commission outlined the following guidelines for residents to protect themselves against these scams:
? If someone claims to be from a utility company, ask to see identification; employees are issued company IDs.
? If someone seems suspicious, do not let them into the home. Use information on a utility bill to contact the company and verify if a worker was sent to the home.
? If receiving a suspicious call, hang up immediately. Caller ID spoofing can make a scammer¡¯s number appear to be from a utility.
? Similarly, an email may appear to be from the company and even link to a website that appears to be the utility¡¯s site. If an email is suspicious, do not click any links and delete the email.
? Utilities will give written notice of payments being past due. If someone from the company calls over the phone, that person will explain how payment may be made.
? A utility will never ask for bank or credit card information over the phone or by email or direct a customer to buy a prepaid debit card or make a wire transfer as payment.
? Anyone who believes they may have been the victim of a utility scam should
? contact local law enforcement or the commission¡¯s Consumer Affairs Technicians at 1-800-642-8544.

Scammers claiming to be from the Chinese Consulate targeted UCR faculty and staff with phone calls during during the week of Oct. 1. This situation was originally publicized through a schoolwide email sent by John Virden, Chief Information Security Officer of Information Technology Solutions (ITS). ¡°The message suggests a critical parcel is available at the consulate that can affect a person¡¯s ability to remain in the United States,¡± according to the email sent by Virden.

In an interview with the Highlander, Virden revealed some of the specifics of the scam. According to reports, a victim would first receive a call from an unknown number and, if answered, a scammer would relay the following message, ¡°This is the consulate; we have an important document that needs to be picked up; it may affect your status in the U.S.; press a button to speak with a specialist.¡± If a target of the scam happened to press the button to proceed, they were connected to another scammer describing a situation of a parcel associated with a police investigation of money laundering. The victim would eventually be connected to a fraudulent law enforcement officer claiming that said victim would have to transfer a sum of money to a bank in Hong Kong in order to have the money laundering charges dropped. The exact amount of money required is unknown.

When asked about the whereabouts of these callers Virden stated, ¡°Sadly, because of the spoofing of phone numbers, the identities and exact locations are currently unknown. However, there are ongoing investigations.¡± The term ¡°spoofing¡± describes the method of deceptively changing the shown location of a call to mask the true location of the call¡¯s origin. While the location isn¡¯t known, according to Virden, it is ¡°highly likely¡± that the calls originate from China due to the request of the scammers to transfer money to a bank in Hong Kong.

One anonymous student claims that his roommate received one of these calls. Realizing the call was a scam, the roommate set his phone on speaker so that he and his roommates could be entertained by the call. This is not recommended by ITS.

These calls are not limited to the UCR campus, as a large series of scam calls have occurred throughout the US, United Kingdom and Australia. Virden urges students and faculty alike to immediately hang up if the scam call is received. If a scam finds its way to a student through email, the email should be deleted. If students or faculty have any further questions, or if they would like to report a scam phone call, they¡¯re urged to contact ITS at (951) 827-IT4U (4848) or BearHelp@ucr.edu. If a student or faculty member happens to comply with the scam, they are urged to contact UCPD at (951) 827-5222.

(WXYZ) - For many Metro Detroiters, it began with a ring but ended in heartbreak.

We¡¯ve tracked countless victims in our area falling for malicious phone scams, often preying on your fear.

We met Kelly Hamlin back in April after she forked over a thousand dollars in gift cards to someone she thought was an IRS agent.

With 127 complaints in the last three years, the BBB says IRS imposters are the top phone scam.

"Take a second, listen to who it is and recognize immediately that the IRS is never gonna call you. They¡¯re not gonna ask for (gift) cards," said Melanie Duquesnel of the Better Business Bureau serving Metro Detroit.

Then there¡¯s the one that preys on your hope of winning cash. The scammer sends you a hefty check, then asks you to send money back in taxes.

Once you send the money, you realize the check you cashed has bounced and is bogus.

Don¡¯t expect to win any money if you¡¯ve never entered a contest. With 120 complaints in the last three years, the BBB says the lottery or prize phone scam takes the second spot.

And rounding out the top three, with 85 complaints, is the warranty scheme, such as when a scammer calls you with an offer to put a warranty on your newly purchased car.

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff¡¯s Office is warning residents of a large number of telephone scams being reported lately.

¡°These scammers are going to great lengths right now to trick anyone and everyone they can into giving them money. Please be careful,¡± a department spokesman said.

In October, for example, the department¡¯s dispatchers received reports of a ¡°virtual kidnapping¡± scam and several reports of the ¡°Southern California Edison scam.¡±

In that particular scam, the caller claims to be from Edison and threatens to shut off the resident¡¯s electricity if a payment is not received over the phone.

The department also received numerous reports of a scam in which the caller poses as a sheriff¡¯s deputy, telling the resident that there is a bench warrant issued for their arrest because they did not show up for jury duty. Dispatchers also are receiving reports about cyber-tech scammers who claim they can fix or upgrade your computer software if you give them your financial information.

In the virtual kidnapping scam, the caller claims to have kidnapped a family member or friend and demands a ransom payment for their release, even though no one has been kidnapped.

The Sheriff¡¯s Office advises anyone receiving a scam call to hang up the phone and notify law enforcement. A virtual kidnapping call can also be reported to the FBI at 310-477-6565 or at www.ic3.gov.

Any phone scam can also be reported to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney¡¯s Fraud Hotline at 805-568-2442 or to the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP or at www.ftc.gov/complaint.

For IRS phone scam complaints, call the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 800-366-4484 or go to www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml.

If you¡¯re in the habit of automatically returning calls you missed, now would be an excellent time to break the habit, at least when it comes to calls from international numbers. Mobile phone users in multiple countries are falling victim to the so-called ¡°wangiri phone scam,¡± which involves calling mobile phones and then hanging up after a single ring.

That¡¯s not even the only major phone scam going on right now, as some Americans (myself included) are receiving voicemail messages from someone claiming to be from Microsoft.

UAE and Ireland struck by the wangiri phone scam

¡°Wangiri¡± is Japanese for ¡°one ring and drop,¡± which is how the wangiri phone scam got its name. Although the scam seems to have originated in Japan, fraudsters are now trying to reach out and touch victims in many other countries.

One of the latest countries to be hit by the scam is the United Arab Emirates. According to news outlets from the country, many users are reporting missed calls from Antarctica, Luxembourg and Nauru, a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean. Others are reporting that they received international calls from South Korea and even the U.S. Some Irish consumers are also receiving wangiri phone scam calls from numbers originating in Chad and Liberia.

Thus, experts are advising consumers not to return calls to international numbers they don¡¯t recognize ? no matter where they originate from. In the UAE, consumers are urged to file complaints with their mobile service providers.

The way the wangiri phone scam works is simple. Scammers often call a block of phone numbers in sequential order using technology to ring multiple numbers at the same time. After a ring or two, they hang up, leaving a missed call on the consumer¡¯s phone.

Victims who return the missed call are often charged up to $50 per minute on their phone bills. Scammers route them back to a phone number which charges premium rates, and then they use technology which prevents victims from disconnecting their callback. An automated message forces the victims to remain on the line until it¡¯s over after several minutes. Often the message includes a number of rings before the recorded voice, so it¡¯s not immediately clear that the call has been picked up.

According to telecom authorities in the UAE, perpetrators of the wangiri phone scam make money by sharing the revenue earned from the calls with the telecom provider in the country the calls originate from.

Returning an international call that¡¯s part of the wangiri phone scam also opens up the victim to a plethora of phishing messages and links to fake contests and lotteries via text messages. Phishing scams associated with the wangiri phone scam often involve claims that the scammer is calling from the victim¡¯s mobile service provider or bank requesting banking information or passwords.

Beware the fake Microsoft voicemail and other phone scams

If you can¡¯t get past the concern that you may have missed an important call, there are some things to keep in mind. If someone is legitimately calling you from overseas, they will leave a voicemail message.

However, leaving a message does not necessarily mean the call is legitimate. It may just mean that the call isn¡¯t part of the Wangiri phone scam. Here in the U.S., I have received voicemails from people claiming to be with ¡°your credit card company,¡± although they obviously didn¡¯t even know which company I have a credit card with, if any. I even received a call from someone who left a voicemail claiming to be from Microsoft and that Windows was going to stop working if I didn¡¯t call the phone number they left. Plenty of other people are reporting similar voicemail messages, including many who don¡¯t even have Windows PCs.

I should clarify that Windows shouldn¡¯t quit working unless your computer is infected or there is some sort of technical problem which occurs without warning. Office 365 may stop working if your subscription runs out and you don¡¯t renew it, but it seems unlikely that Microsoft will call to tell you this. They do send emails about it, but we recommend going to the company¡¯s website and logging in directly rather than clicking on any links in any email.

If you receive a call from a company with a questionable message such as this, you should never call back the number they leave on the voicemail. Instead, you can look up publicly-listed customer service numbers for the company on its website and call those numbers instead to find out if the voicemail was legitimate.

And remember: no company will ever call and demand personal information, banking details or passwords. Not falling victim to scams such as the wangiri phone scam or fake Microsoft voicemail is as simple as not returning suspicious calls.

KILGORE, Texas (KETK) - Kilgore police are warning about a phone scam in which the callers tell people they are past due in payments to AEP Southwestern Electric Power Co. and are about to have their meters pulled.

The callers, who are likely to be foreigners, demand the recipient buy Green Dot debit cards and provide the callers with the numbers, according to a police department Facebook post made Thursday.

According to our newspaper partner, Longview News Journal, SWEPCO has posted about the scam since 2014 to alert customers not to be deceived. The imposter might have a caller ID that says SWEPCO or play hold music similar to what SWEPCO uses. The department says SWEPCO does not call and threaten disconnection for past-due bills and will never ask for untraceable debit or gift cards to be bought to pay a customer¡¯s account.

Recipients of the calls should contact local police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) and notify SWEPCO.

The Tri-State Better Business Bureau is warning residents about a new phone scam regarding Medicare. In case you were unaware, you will receive new Medicare cards in April of 2019. These cards are said to be more secure. According to 44 News , they are more secure because "they use a M edicare beneficiary identifier instead of a social security number."

With the new cards being sent out, of course someone had to fine a way to take advantage of the situation to create a new scam. According to 44 News , here's how the new scam works:

You receive a call from a person claiming to work with M edicare . They are allegedly calling about a problem with your new M edicare card. The con artist may say your new card was lost or someone tried to use your id number. To resolve the situation, the scammer just needs your social security number.in another version, the scammer claims you must pay money to receive your new M edicare card. They may ask you for payment information, so they can complete the process for you. They may even ask you to mail them your old card.

Medicare will not be calling anyone about the new cards, nor will they have you pay for the new secure card. If an unknown caller asks you to verify your personal information over the phone, never comply. Hang up and report the call to the Better Business Bureau.

ST. PETERS (KMOV.com) - Betty Sleet says the calls were non-stop.

¡°Very frustrating and very annoying, that they just continue constantly,¡± said Sleet.

She says the bombardment of calls came after she picked up an unknown call to her cell phone on Monday. After that, the flood of quickly followed.

¡°I got a phone call from Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Florida, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Massachusetts,¡± she said.

Fed up, Sleet and her daughter began investigating and found she¡¯d become the latest victim of what¡¯s called a ¡°spoofing" scam.

¡°Someone had gotten my phone number and it was calling all these people,¡± said Sleet.

Experts say this type of scam is on the rise this year.

For the scam to work, a caller must pick up the phone call, so the scammers know it¡¯s a real phone number. They¡¯ll then take your number and use it to call hundreds of others across the nation in attempts to scam them.

¡°It¡¯s I guess it¡¯s kind of heart wrenching that there are people out in the world that want to do this to people,¡± said Sleet.

Sleet says she got aggressive and vulgar calls and messages from other upset callers thinking she was the one behind the phone calls.

¡°I just hope it doesn¡¯t happen to me again,¡± said Sleet.

Experts say police and cell phone companies can¡¯t do much to protect people from this scam.

Consumer experts say the best way to protect yourself from this scam is to not pick up unknown calls.

MILWAUKEE -- It is a crime that comes in with the cold. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says this scam operates over the phone. While it happens throughout Milwaukee, the city's south side has been heavily targeted.

"Anybody that pays for heat is going to be affected by this scam. If you're a homeowner, a business owner, a renter in certain places," said Jim Temmer of the BBB.

Temmer said criminals claiming to be We Energies workers are targeting small businesses claiming their energy bill is long past due.

"They threaten to turn off your heat and you don't want that to happen," Temmer said.

The caller demands money or they will kill the power.

"Maybe there is a legitimate problem with We Energies, but they are not going to ask for payment on a prepaid debit card," Temmer said.

It is the exact call Antonio Ingrilli received at Caterina's at 92nd and Oklahoma in West Allis.

"They said I was behind on the bill and they were going to cut the electricity," Ingrilli said.

But the BBB says others in Milwaukee have fallen for the ploy.

"We found this scam is prevalent in the Hispanic-speaking communities." "We found this scam is prevalent in the Hispanic-speaking communities -- and they are using Spanish-speaking scammers," Temmer said.

Temmer said if you do get this call to contact the BBB and We Energies, but only after you hang up the phone. He also said if you are a small business owner, keep your guard up.

"They always pick the small places and not the chains," Ingrilli said.

According to the BBB, We Energies has received 600 reports of this particular phone scam.

Every single day, people are called with the latest scam.

But it¡¯s not everyday you hear about a school being targeted.

The caller claimed to being a sports media marketing company offering the opportunity for advertising.

That is if you pay a few hundred dollars.

We decided to give them a call.

¡°You have reached sports media,¡± said the voicemail for (469)209-6940.

Multiple calls went unanswered and sent to voicemail.

¡°All of our sales reps are currently busy,¡± said the recorded voice on the phone. ¡°If you would leaved a detailed message, we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you.¡±

But when this number called Sheyenne High School, the school¡¯s staff made sure to do their research.

They popped the number into a quick search, and they found that this number is commonly associated with similar scams involving high schools and businesses across the country.

You can do the same thing with any suspicious phone number.

Putting the number in a search engine will pull up information to see if it has been associated with a scam.

Whitepages will also assess the number and tell the ¡°spam or fraud potential¡± as well as show previous reports.

(469)209-6940 has been deemed a scam on this site.

So make sure you keep yourself protected and do your homework before trusting every call that comes your way.

LAS VEGAS (KTNV) - If you have a peer-to-peer cash app on your phone, you may want to check your settings. A new scam is targeting anybody with apps, like Venmo.

The scam starts when a stranger approaches you on the street, and asks to borrow your phone to make a quick call. Instead of typing in a phone number, he finds a cash app and does a quick transfer to his account.

To protect yourself, go into the app settings and scroll down to security to set up a pin. This will ensure you'll be the only one to access the app.

Another way to protect yourself, with whatever cash app you use, the Better Business Bureau says to only link your account to a credit card. Credit cards will almost always reimburse you for fraud.

FRAUDSTERS are pretending to be police when phoning residents in York as part of a new scam.

North Yorkshire Police said a number of residents had received calls from people offering "crime awareness appointments in peoples homes to offer them advice".

However, a force spokeswoman said: "The number is not linked to North Yorkshire Police and is believed to be bogus, please don't let strangers into your home and report incidents to 101."

Detective Inspector Jon Hodgeon from the force's Major Fraud and Economic Crime Unit, said this was likely the latest attempt by fraudsters to target certain residents.

He said: "People aren¡¯t always who they say they are. Fraudsters use a range of tactics to target people, especially the elderly and vulnerable. They may pretend to be from your bank, the police, a utility company, a government department or someone else you usually deal with and trust.

"Never just assume someone is who they say they are. Be confident and refuse unusual requests for personal or financial information. It¡¯s okay to stop the discussion if you do not feel in control of it. If you need to call the police or your bank back to check, wait five minutes and call someone you trust first to make sure the phone line is free or use a different line all together ? one of the many tricks fraudsters use is to stay on the line after you hang up to make you think that you are speaking to someone genuine."

Det Insp Hodgeon also advised speaking to a trusted relative, friend or neighbou behore acting or handing over money or details, and always to phone 101 or 999 if a crime is in action.

Incidents can also be reported to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk or on 0300 1232040.

Det Insp Hodgeon also offered six tips to the public to help them spot potential scams:

1. The police or your bank will never phone and ask you for your PIN or full banking password, even by tapping them into your phone keypad.

2. The police or your bank will never ask you to withdraw money to hand over to them for safe-keeping or to aid an investigation.

3. The police or your bank will never ask you to transfer money to a safe account for fraud or investigation reasons, even if they say it is in your name.

4. The police or your bank will never send someone to your home to collect cash, PIN, cards or cheque books if you are a victim of fraud.

5. The police or your bank will never ask you to purchase goods using your card and then hand them over for safe-keeping.

6. The police or your bank will never ask you to lie to your bank about why you are withdrawing or transferring money.

FARMINGTON ? State and local officials are advising citizens to be vigilant as certain phone scams are seeing a recent increase in local activity.

There are three types of phone scams resurfacing that Farmington citizens have reported to the Farmington Police Department recently, according to spokesperson Georgette Allen.

"We're trying to encourage people who have loved ones or friends who are not on the Internet to make sure the information is getting to them," Allen said.

The three scams deal with law enforcement, the Farmington Electric Utility System and cell phone service providers.

Scammers have been spoofing or imitating the phone numbers of the Farmington Police Department, and calling people to warn them they have a warrant for their arrest. The targets of the scam are instructed to pay the caller or they will be arrested, Allen said.

Allen added some of the scammers have been using Farmington police Chief Steve Hebbe's name in the calls.

Some Farmington detectives have received phone scam calls that spoofed their own work phone numbers.

"The chief is never going to call you and say, 'You got a warrant, and I'm coming to arrest you,'" Allen said.

Scammers often request that payments be made by having the victim purchase a prepaid debit, credit or gift card, then call the scammer back and share the information on the card with them, according to Allen. She said sometimes scammers will even request that the victim stay on the line with them while they purchase a card from a third party.

Any request that involves payment using that method should be a big red flag to potential victims, according to Jennie Lusk, director of the consumer and family advocacy services division for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. Lusk said nobody running a reputable business would request payment that way.

The Farmington Electric Utility System has been dealing with a similar issue. Scammers have been spoofing the city of Farmington phone numbers, warning account holders they are behind on payments and demanding money to avoid termination of service, Allen said.

The Farmington Electric Utility System mails disconnection notices to users, and citizens can call 505-599-1353 to check the status of their account, according to a Farmington Police Department press release.

Lusk reminded citizens that they are in control as the scammers try to get people to respond out of impulse or the scammer's politeness.

"A lot of times, the scammer (acts like the) consumer's best friend," Lusk said.

Both Allen and Lusk warned citizens to avoid sharing any personal information with someone who could be a scammer. They also suggested that citizens verify any claim by hanging up the phone and calling the organization or company that the caller claimed to represent.

Lusk said even the AG's Office has received calls from scammers calling residents, warning them their Social Security number has been deactivated and seeking personal information to reactivate the number.

Farmington police also have received reports of a scam in which the caller claims to be a representative of the recipient's cell phone service, stating their service will be suspended unless they confirm their personal information, Allen said.

Farmington residents can report the scams to the police by calling nonemergency dispatch at 505-334-6622.

Scams can be reported to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office at www.nmag.gov or to the Federal Trade Commission by visiting www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov or calling 1-877-382-4357.

PETALING JAYA: From telemarketers offering credit cards and insurance to criminal Macau scam syndicates, Malaysian mobile phone users are being hounded by a fast-rising number of spam calls.

Anti-spam mobile application Truecaller said that its 1.7 million users in Malaysia received more than 30 million spam calls this year alone which the app managed to block.

¡°To give you an example of how fast this problem is growing, since January, we¡¯ve seen a 100% increase in spam calls,¡± said Truecaller¡¯s director of communications Kim Fai Kok.

Truecaller claims to have 250 million users worldwide and has offices in Sweden, United States and India.

There were 10.8 million postpaid mobile phone users and 33.3 million prepaid users in Malaysia up to end-June this year, according to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

Kim said Truecaller users in Malaysia receive an average of six spam calls a month, the second highest in South-East Asia after Indonesia where users get an average of eight. Users in Singapore and Thailand receive four respectively, while in Vietnam the figure is even lower at two, said Kim.

He said the major driver of spam calls in Malaysia are those offering financial services, which account for 67% of the spam calls.

Typically, these are banking product offers or cold calls from credit card companies.

Another major problem that Malaysians have to deal with is unsolicited telemarketing calls that make up 13% of total spam calls reported.

Kim said telemarketing calls can further be broken down into promotional calls from companies, surveys being done by analytics firms on behalf of their clients, or new client outreach for services and subscriptions.

Another 9% are calls from insurance companies offering to sell different types of policies, while calls from telecommunications companies selling data and offering promotions make up another 4%. The remaining 6% are debt collection, nuisance and scam calls.

The Personal Data Protection Act 2010 regulates and protects the use of personal data collected by companies including banks, hotels and airlines.

An individual who keeps getting spam calls from any of these companies and feels that their personal data may have been processed in breach of any provision of the Act can make a complaint to the Personal Data Protection Commissioner.

However, some spam calls come from firms that the user has not given any personal details to previously. Others are from scammers such as the Macau syndicate.

The MCMC when contacted advised the public to be vigilant and take precautionary measures whenever receiving calls from unknown numbers.

These includes lodging a complaint to the commission on the matter, which can be channelled to aduanskmm@mcmc.gov.my.

In a recent post on the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) Facebook page, police advised smartphone users to install mobile apps that block spam calls and messages.

Statistics from the Communica¡©tions and Multimedia Ministry showed that telecommunications fraud cases involved an estimated RM162.6mil this year alone, with the Macau Scam being the most common.

Kuala Lumpur Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) chief Asst Comm Mohd Luthfi Ismail Abdullah said while spam call-blocking apps could be beneficial, members of the public should not solely depend on them to prevent them from being victims of scams, especially Macau scams, as the number of cases has increased significantly recently.

¡°We must always stay vigilant and suspicious of numbers that could be from scammers. The best thing to do is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers.

¡°Avoiding conversation with these scammers is the best way to avoid becoming victims,¡± he said.

For Macau scams, ACP Mohd Luthfi reminded the public that the authorities, such as the police and Bank Negara, would not call them directly regarding official matters.

¡°Do not believe it if out of the blue, someone claiming to be the police or from other agencies, calls you to inform that you are being investigated or even that your account has been frozen.

¡°If you receive such suspicious calls and talk to these scammers, call the authorities directly, don¡¯t follow the number given by the scammers,¡± he said.

A Macau Scam often starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be an officer from a bank, government agency or debt collector.

The scammer will then claim that the potential victim owes money or has an unpaid fine, often with a very short window of less than an hour to settle the payment or face dire consequences.

The unsuspecting victims will then be asked to make payments to get them off the hook.

According to the PDRM Facebook post, spam blocking apps typically work by gathering phone numbers that have already been reported.

While there is no guarantee that such apps can completely stop scammers, smartphone users can reduce the risks, the police said.

Some may be wary about giving permissions to an app such as Truecaller.

After all, the app¡¯s privacy policy states that contact information collected and used would include phone numbers as well as attached names, Google IDs and e-mail addresses from one¡¯s address book.

However Kim assures that: ¡°People can use Truecaller without sharing their contacts, but to get the best experience we need certain permissions.

¡°To give you an example, True¡©caller also works as a phone and SMS app.

¡°The value we provide with our dialer is that we put a name to number in your call history ? which is extremely helpful. And for the SMS feature we automatically help filter out spam messages and keep your inbox clean from being cluttered.¡±

If you don¡¯t want to install another app, some phone makers like Samsung include spam call protection in their phones.

This feature can be turned on from the dialler app. Open the app, click the three dots on the top right hand corner and then pick Settings. Scroll down and you will see the option Caller ID and Spam Protection.

To turn it on you will have to also agree to share your contacts with the service Hiya, a caller ID and blocking service.

Another angle on a common scam is targeting Trumbull County residents according to the sheriff.

Chief Sheriff's Deputy Joe Dragovich tells 21 News they are investigating reports from a person who says they got a call from someone on a Trac phone claiming to be a ¡°Lieutenant Walker¡± from the Trumbull County Sheriff's Department.

The alleged ¡°Lt. Walker¡± tells the person that he or she missed a subpoena to appear before a grand jury and say they now need to pay $850 on a prepaid Visa or face arrest.

Dragovich says there is no Lieutenant Walker at his office and they would never call someone for something like this.

He wants to make sure the public is aware of the scam so they don't fall for it.

Anyone who receives such a phone call should report it to local authorities. Always check with the agency the caller is alleging to work for and never agree to meet the caller to remedy a legal issue with a prepaid credit card.

Dubai: A manager has been jailed for one year for cheating a woman of Dh21,000 after deceitfully convincing her that she had won Dh200,000 cash prize from du.

The Russian received an SMS followed by a phone call from someone who told her he was from du and that her number won a grand prize of Dh200,000 in September 2017.

The Russian, who fell for the trick, was told to pay Dh21,000 as tax in order to claim her prize.

She paid the ¡®tax¡¯ in phone credits and made instant cash transfer before realising she had become a victim of phone scam.

On Tuesday, the Dubai Court of First Instance convicted the 26-year-old Pakistani defendant of using someone else¡¯s Emirates ID when he went to collect the transfer, swindling and embezzling the Russian¡¯s money.

Court records said the accused abetted two suspects, who remain at large, in tricking the employee and embezzling her Dh21,000.

Presiding judge Mohammad Jamal said the accused, who pleaded not guilty, will be deported.

¡°I used the Emirates ID, but I did not swindle the claimant or embezzle her money,¡± he told the court.

The Russian said she fell for the caller once she was notified about her name and work address.

¡°The caller said I should pay them Dh21,000 in tax fees to be able to claim my Dh200,000 prize. He gave me a man¡¯s name and said I should transfer the fees to that person. He said that the transfer should be in the form of phone credit. I sent them Dh12,500 and Dh2,000 in instant cash transfer and the remainder in phone credit. Later I discovered that I had been duped and reported the matter to the police,¡± she testified to prosecutors.

The accused told prosecutors that he met one of the two runaway suspects, who informed him that they had intended to trick victims and embezzle their money.

¡°He didn¡¯t tell me how, but he just asked me to collect instant cash transfers in the name of someone called Gulam. The other suspect handed me the ID to present it at money exchange houses to collect the cash,¡± the suspect said.

LAS CRUCES - A new form of check fraud is circulating in Dona Ana County, and sheriff¡¯s detectives are warning residents to be cautious when conducting business on classified advertisement websites like Craigslist.

A Dona Ana County resident recently told sheriff¡¯s detectives they had received a check in the mail from someone who had inquired about an item for sale on Craigslist. The cashier¡¯s check was made out for $1,930, and included instructions on how to cash the check and keep the ¡°remainder in cash or Walmart gift cards¡± that would be ¡°picked up at a later date.¡±

The resident keenly recognized the check as fraudulent and turned it over to the sheriff¡¯s department.

Dona Ana County Sheriff¡¯s detectives warn residents to be skeptical when conducting business over the Internet, and advise them never to disclose personal or sensitive information such as bank account or Social Security numbers over the phone.

MINNEAPOLIS ? Get any robocalls lately? No need to answer, we already know, yes, yes, a thousand times yes! It¡¯s enough to drive you batty, so what can you do about it?

Don¡¯t answer your phone. For real. That¡¯s the advice from every expert we talked to.

More specifically if you don¡¯t recognize the phone number, you shouldn¡¯t pick it up. But, why?

¡°The scammers have gotten more and more sophisticated over the last year or two and they're making money unfortunately,¡± says Gavin Macomber with First Orion.

First Orion is in the business of stopping those pesky and illegal robocalls, including something new called neighborhood spoofing.

¡°A scammer basically hijacks a number that looks just like yours - same area code, same prefix, looks like a business or neighbor down the road, but it's not. It's somebody trying to get you to answer the phone and then pretend to be somebody they're not."

How bad is the problem? First Orion has never been busier.

"We think the number of scam calls next year could approach 50 percent," Macomber says.

Nearly half of all calls made to mobile phones next year are expected to be fraudulent. Well 44.6 percent to be exact. It's already so bad that robocalls are currently the number one complaint to the FCC which has started a Robocall Strike force to combat the issue.

The Better Business Bureau gets calls about robocalls every single day. But, it¡¯s not just the annoyance. It's costing people millions and senior citizens are hit particularly hard.

"They thought it was their bank; they thought it was Walgreens; they thought it was their church and they engage with people that they think that they know, and they send money. It just happens an excruciating amount,¡± says Lisa Jemtrud with the Better Business Bureau.

So, why doesn't your wireless company do something about it? They actually are.

Verizon already has Caller Name ID, which is an app that can filter out spam calls, and they plan to roll out a voice verification system this fall.

"Think of it like Twitter. When you have a high-profile account, like an athlete, or actress or actor, they get that blue checkmark that verifies that it's an authentic account. That is similar to what will happen when a call comes on to your screen. You¡¯ll have a checkmark or a symbol that will verify that the call originated from that number,¡± says Megan Dorsch with Verizon.

But right now, the criminals are one step ahead. So, what else can you do? We weren't kidding when we said don't answer your phone.

¡°The reason why is because scam artists use technology, and once you pick up the phone, it's a trigger for them that there's a live person at the end of that number, and you automatically get registered on all sorts of other lists. It's just going to increase the phone calls,¡± says Jemtrud.

¡°They say something like, 'Can you hear me?' or, 'Is this Sandy?' And you say, 'Yes', and they capture that to be used for unscrupulous purposes,¡± she explains.

You can and should file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission, which runs the do not call list. And, if you haven't yet, get on the list.

See what your phone company provides and check out third party robocall blocking apps. And then you wait. Until it's finally safe to answer your phone again.

IBERVILLE PARISH - Officials are warning Iberville Parish residents of a potential phone scam circulating in the area.

According to the parish council, the scam involves people calling residents with a "spoofed" number reading as 911. When the victim answers, the caller allegedly tells the recipient that a loved one has been involved in a car crash or some other traumatic incident in an effort to get them to give up personal information.

The council warns that a call from a number appearing as 911 is never legitimate. Officials recommend residents remain cautious and block suspicious numbers altogether.

PALOS PARK, IL -- Family members stopped an elderly woman from forwarding thousands of dollars after being contacted by scammers informing that her social security number was being used to sell copious amounts of drugs. It's the latest scam targeting seniors, Palos Park police said.

The woman was called on her home phone Oct. 6, in which the caller told her that her social security number was being used "to sell a large amount of drugs." The scammer told the woman that "this needed to be cleared up." She was instructed to empty her bank account and send the scammers money to take care of the problem. (SUBSCRIBE: Get Real-Time Alerts and a Daily Newsletter for Palos.)

Police said the woman provided her cell phone number. While driving to the bank to withdraw $15,000 from her account, she was in constant communication with the scammer on her cell phone. The scammer guided her through the process so she could get the money to the right people to rectify "this problem with your social security number."

The woman did go to her bank to withdraw the funds. Luckily, she became suspicious and called her family before wiring the $15,000. She was able to abort contact with the scammers. The incident is under investigation.

FAIRBANKS?Fairbanks police are warning the public not to reveal their Social Security numbers or other banking information to unknown callers after a local woman was swindled out of $26,000 in a telephone scam.

According to a post on the Fairbanks Police Department's Facebook page Wednesday, the scammer claimed to be calling from the Social Security Administration and told the woman her bank account had been compromised by someone caught transporting drugs over state lines. The woman was told she needed to move her money out of her account and into a new, more secure bank.

The caller gave the woman bank routing information and told her an Social Security Administration agent would contact her soon to give her a new Social Security number. The woman transferred her money to the new bank account and never heard from the scammer again.

Fairbanks police stress that government agencies do not operate in this fashion and that people should be aware that scammers are getting bolder and actively looking for new victims.

"The Social Security scam has been out there for a long time, but normally people report it's about $3,000 or so that they're asking for," police spokeswoman Yumi McCulloch said Wednesday. "This time it was significantly higher than normal."

A murder trial has been adjourned at the Central Criminal Court after jurors were targeted in what¡¯s thought to be a phone scam, where the caller claimed to be from the Courts Service.

The jurors were serving in the trial of a father-of-five, who shot his friend dead and dismembered his remains, which were later found in the Grand Canal.

The jurors had spent the first part of the day on Tuesday hearing the contents of garda interviews carried out with Paul Well Snr, who was denying involvement in Kenneth O¡¯Brien¡¯s murder.

The 50-year-old of Barnamore Park in Finglas has now admitted shooting dead his fellow Dubliner and dismembering his body. However, he has pleaded not guilty to murdering the 33-year-old at his home in Barnamore Park on 15th or 16th January, 2016.

He claims that the deceased had wanted him to murder Mr O¡¯Brien¡¯s partner, so that he could take their child back to Australia, where he had previously lived.

The jury heard evidence on Tuesday of what Mr Wells had said in half a dozen interviews, including telling gardai that they should go to Australia to find out why Mr O¡¯Brien was murdered. He also said he could not say why the deceased had transferred more than ¢æ50,000 into his account.

The 11 jurors were asked to go to their jury room while the parties arranged the next portion of interviews to be played on DVD. However, when they returned to court, they informed the judge of other developments.

The foreman said that both he and another juror had received missed calls from the same Dublin number in the space of half an hour. The other juror had also received a voicemail.

¡°It was distorted,¡± he said. ¡°You could just make out Courts Service.¡±

Mr Justice Paul McDermott sent the jury away again, later calling all 11 back to say that a preliminary investigation had indicated that the call was part of a scam.

He called the officer, who had carried out the enquiries, Sergeant Gerard Moore.

¡°It appears to be a scam,¡± he testified, explaining that people would dial the number from which the missed call would come.

¡°They¡¯re eliciting information as opposed to giving information,¡± he said of what would be heard on the other side.

Justice McDermott said that it appeared that it was nothing to do with the murder case and nothing to do with anything the jury had heard in court.

¡°I hope you¡¯re reassured by that,¡± he said.

He said that, in order for this investigation to be fully concluded, he would ask for the phones to be made available to a garda, who could listen to the voicemail.

¡°We can resume tomorrow when the investigation is completed,¡± he said, adjourning the murder trial until Wednesday morning.

Sgt Martin Long had testified earlier that he was involved in interviewing the accused following his arrest on suspicion of murder.

He said that Mr Wells said nobody else had access to his bank account and denied Mr O¡¯Brien had owed him any money.

He explained that he was in receipt of Jobseeker¡¯s Benefit of ¢æ320 a week and that the most he would have in his bank account would be a few hundred euro.

The gardai then asked if he could tell them about the ¢æ14,500 he had withdrawn from that account that January.

¡°No, I can¡¯t,¡± he replied. ¡°It¡¯s not in my possession anyway.¡±

He was asked if it had anything to with the murder of Mr O¡¯Brien.

¡°No,¡± he insisted. ¡°I wasn¡¯t involved in any of his activities.¡±

He agreed that the ¢æ52,925 that had been transferred into his account over the previous 18 months had belonged to Mr O¡¯Brien.

¡°A man was murdered. A lot of his money goes into your account,¡± remarked the gardai, explaining that they needed to find out what happened.

¡°You¡¯d better go to Australia then,¡± replied Mr Wells.

SAN ANGELO, TX ? There is another phone scam going around, but this time it is targeting parents of high school students preparing for college. The scammers claim to be from The College Board which is the organization that is responsible for the PSAT and SAT tests.

They are calling or emailing people, asking for credit card numbers so they can send PSAT prep materials that the student has supposedly requested. The scammers usually have the student¡¯s name, address and phone number which makes the scam seem more believable. Except for the face that your student didn't ask for materials, and it¡¯s not this group that is calling.

Here are some tips to avoid a test prep scam: https://go.usa.gov/xPUZT
? None will never ask you to give credit card, bank account or password information over the phone or via email. will never ask you to give credit card, bank account or password information over the phone or via email.
? None Make sure the company offering test prep materials is legitimate. Before you give up your money or personal information, research the company online. Search for their name plus the word ¡°scam¡± or ¡°complaint.¡± See about other people¡¯s experiences and talk to someone you trust, like another parent or your child¡¯s school counselor, before you pay.
? None Consider how you pay. Credit cards have significant fraud protection built in meaning that, if you find out you paid a scammer, you may be able to get your money back if you report it quickly. If anyone asks you to pay by wiring money or by using a re-loadable card or gift card, it¡¯s a scam.

If you have been targeted by a scam, whether you lost money or not, let us know at ftc.gov/complaint.

Con artists across the country continue using scare tactics to try and steal money and personal information from utility customers. It?s a problem for utilities as much as for the victims, which is why FirstEnergy and dozens of other electric and gas companies are banding together for Utilities United Against Scams Day to #StopScams.

The annual event is organized by Utilities United Against Scams ? a group consisting of more than 100 utilities and related organizations ? to raise awareness about the ever-growing list of scams targeting utility customers.

?We take our customers? safety and security very seriously,? said Gary W. Grant, vice president of customer service for FirstEnergy Utilities. ?Scammers can be very convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, like senior citizens or business owners who rely on electric service to run their business and make a living.?

As the temperatures continue to dip this winter, both residential and business customers should be on alert for calls or door-to-door visits from scammers who demand immediate payment to avoid service disconnection. Although the scammers work year-round, they are most active in the winter and summer months, when people cannot go without heat or air conditioning.

Last year, FirstEnergy?s utilities received 959 reports of scams from customers?more than twice the number of reports received in 2016. The actual number of scam attempts is even higher since most are only reported to law enforcement or go unreported.

With a goal of curbing the number of reported scams among its customers, FirstEnergy in April published an award-winning video, ?Hang Up, Don?t Pay Up: When a Scammer Calls" featuring two business owners contacted by phone scammers impersonating FirstEnergy electric company employees. The video provides red flags and tips for avoiding scams.

Customers are urged to keep the following tips in mind to help ensure the safety of their family, property and personal information:
? Customers with past-due accounts will receive a written notice of their account status, with instructions on how to avoid disconnection of service.
? While FirstEnergy representatives oftentimes make courtesy calls to customers to remind them about an outstanding balance, they would explain how a payment can be made using the established payment options. They will not demand payment over the phone or at a particular physical location.
? FirstEnergy field collectors ? carrying company-issued photo identification ? will offer customers with past-due accounts the opportunity to pay their bill in person before shutting them off. This does not apply to Pennsylvania customers.
? FirstEnergy does not accept prepaid debit cards or wire transfers as payment, and their representatives will not demand bank or credit card information over the phone.
? Customers who suspect a scam should hang up the phone/close the door, and call the local police then FirstEnergy. Never dial the phone number the scammers provide.

?We encourage customers to contact us directly using the phone number listed on our website and on their billing statement if they need to verify the status of their electric account or the confirm the identity of a FirstEnergy employee,? said Grant. ?When in doubt, always give us a call.?

Please share this information with friends and family to continue raising awareness of these crimes, and periodically visit firstenergycorp.com/scaminfo to check for updates on emerging scam activity.

International Air Transport Association codes (IATA) are used to identify airports. Often derived using letters from the name of the city the airport is located in, these three letter codes can be quite amusing.

A one way trip to FUK with a stopover in OMG 1:22

TOURISTS in Paris are warning others after a cabbie tried to scam them into paying almost five times the real cost of a taxi ? and then got angry when they refused.

The couple, from Thailand, filmed an incident in which a taxi driver tried to charge them an eye-watering fee of ¢æ247 ($385) for a 45km ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city centre.

Official Paris cabs charge a flat rate from the airport of ¢æ50 ($78) to anywhere on the Right Bank of Paris and ¢æ55 ($86) to anywhere on the Left Bank. It¡¯s based on rules introduced in 2016.

Subscribe to news.com.au¡¯s From The Newsroom podcast

But in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube, the driver angrily insists his ¢æ247 fee is correct and argues with the couple after they challenge it.

He tells the couple taxi fees in Paris were ¡°not fixed price. It¡¯s by (the) meter.¡± The meter appears to be an app on the driver¡¯s phone.

The video shows the driver getting angry when the couple demand to see his licence. He also lunges towards the back seat to stop one of the tourists filming him with his phone.

At one point, the couple ask to be taken to a police station so they can sort out the matter.

¡°I¡¯m not going to police. You pay me, you go to police. What is your problem?¡± the driver tells them.

After many tense minutes of arguing, the couple eventually agree to pay a compromise price of ¢æ200 ($311) so they can finally get out of the cab.

One of the tourists, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, told Le Parisien the driver had locked the doors.

¡°The doors were locked, and we had all our luggage in the trunk,¡± he said, according to a translation by The Independent.

¡°He did not want to let us out, and kept driving while (supposedly) phoning his company to find a compromise.¡±

¡°So, we decided to pay ¢æ200 to get out.¡±

The driver said he belonged to Chauffeur Prive. It is a legitimate company but its website advertises a flat rate of ¢æ45 ($70), The Independent reported.

The couple has already left Paris, but police are understood to be investigating the incident.

They said they wanted their experience to be ¡°a case study for other Thai people or travellers to be conscious while they are travelling.¡±

The video has clocked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube.

Paris is the third most visited city in the world, with 17.44 million tourists visiting in 2017.

On its website, Paris Airport advises visitors to say no to people posed as taxi drivers who approach them outside the baggage claim area, as official drivers operate this way.

Visitors should go outside the terminal for the dedicated taxi area and look for an illuminated sign on the outside of the cab and a meter on the inside.

The airport also says visitors can pre-book taxis through the official site for peace of mind.

? ¡°There¡¯s something wrong with your car!¡± scam: As you¡¯re driving a car pulls alongside and the driver indicates there¡¯s something drastically wrong with the rear of your vehicle. You stop, and as you and the stranger go to inspect the problem an accomplice makes off with your wallet/purse from the front seat.
? Hotel rats of Paris: Gangs of thieves are disguising themselves as tourists and infiltrating hotels around Paris. Some of them are opportunistic and will hang out in the lobby waiting for luggage and personal belongings to be left unattended before swooping.

Others are a bit more sophisticated and will actually check into hotels popular with tourists and then break into other hotel rooms to steal valuables.
? Moped gangs of London: Groups of armed thieves are roaming the streets on mopeds and scooters mugging and assaulting unassuming pedestrians and motorists.

EL CENTRO, Calif. - The Imperial Valley Sheriff¡¯s Office is warning residents of yet another phone scam.

ICSO officials said someone is calling residents and telling them they have a warrant for their arrest because they missed jury duty. They offer a payment plan to avoid being arrested.

ELKINS ? Davis Health System is warning residents about a phone scam that uses caller ID spoofing.

¡°We are aware of two recent incidents where a local resident has received a call that appears to be coming from Davis Medical Center with the caller offering to sign people up for a Davis Medical Center credit card,¡± said Tracy Fath, vice president of Marketing and Development.

¡°In both incidences the caller identified himself as ¡°Mario.¡± He does not work here and we don¡¯t solicit people for credit cards. We¡¯re making the public aware so that they do not provide any personal information to these callers.¡±

Caller ID spoofing is a manipulation of the caller ID feature that allows a scammer to disguise their true identity.

In this case, the caller is disguising himself as a representative of Davis Medical Center.

¡°Davis Medical does not make phone calls regarding a patient¡¯s personal credit card accounts,¡± Fath added.

If someone receives one of these calls, they should hang up and call Davis Medical Center¡¯s Patient Representative at 304-637-3773 for assistance.

A woman living in Lincoln was scammed out of ¡Ì2,500 after a call from a person claiming to work for her banking group, Barclays bank.

The caller told the woman on October 19 that they had to open a new bank account for her and that she needed to transfer ¡Ì2,500 into the account, which she did.

The woman was then told to attend an appointment at her local Barclays bank a couple of days later, but when she turned up she was told by staff they knew nothing about it.

This is one of several telephone scams that have been reported across Lincolnshire to police this month and they area reminding people to stay vigilant.

In a number of other cases the caller claims to be from either HMRC or the police, threatening an arrest, a lawsuit or telling the victims that they are under investigation, to get them to pay money.

Lincolnshire Police said: ¡°Please be aware that not all calls are the same and criminals can continue to change tactics.

¡°We are also asking for members of the public to tell their elderly family members and friends about of this fraud, and to raise as much awareness as possible.

IBERVILLE PARISH - Officials are warning Iberville Parish residents of a potential phone scam circulating in the area.

According to the parish council, the scam involves people calling residents with a "spoofed" number reading as 911. When the victim answers, the caller allegedly tells the recipient that a loved one has been involved in a car crash or some other traumatic incident in an effort to get them to give up personal information.

The council warns that a call from a number appearing as 911 is never legitimate. Officials recommend residents remain cautious and block suspicious numbers altogether.

PALOS PARK, IL -- Family members stopped an elderly woman from forwarding thousands of dollars after being contacted by scammers informing that her social security number was being used to sell copious amounts of drugs. It's the latest scam targeting seniors, Palos Park police said.

The woman was called on her home phone Oct. 6, in which the caller told her that her social security number was being used "to sell a large amount of drugs." The scammer told the woman that "this needed to be cleared up." She was instructed to empty her bank account and send the scammers money to take care of the problem. (SUBSCRIBE: Get Real-Time Alerts and a Daily Newsletter for Palos.)

Police said the woman provided her cell phone number. While driving to the bank to withdraw $15,000 from her account, she was in constant communication with the scammer on her cell phone. The scammer guided her through the process so she could get the money to the right people to rectify "this problem with your social security number."

The woman did go to her bank to withdraw the funds. Luckily, she became suspicious and called her family before wiring the $15,000. She was able to abort contact with the scammers. The incident is under investigation.

FAIRBANKS?Fairbanks police are warning the public not to reveal their Social Security numbers or other banking information to unknown callers after a local woman was swindled out of $26,000 in a telephone scam.

According to a post on the Fairbanks Police Department's Facebook page Wednesday, the scammer claimed to be calling from the Social Security Administration and told the woman her bank account had been compromised by someone caught transporting drugs over state lines. The woman was told she needed to move her money out of her account and into a new, more secure bank.

The caller gave the woman bank routing information and told her an Social Security Administration agent would contact her soon to give her a new Social Security number. The woman transferred her money to the new bank account and never heard from the scammer again.

Fairbanks police stress that government agencies do not operate in this fashion and that people should be aware that scammers are getting bolder and actively looking for new victims.

"The Social Security scam has been out there for a long time, but normally people report it's about $3,000 or so that they're asking for," police spokeswoman Yumi McCulloch said Wednesday. "This time it was significantly higher than normal."

ELKINS ? Davis Health System is warning residents about a phone scam that uses caller ID spoofing.

¡°We are aware of two recent incidents where a local resident has received a call that appears to be coming from Davis Medical Center with the caller offering to sign people up for a Davis Medical Center credit card,¡± said Tracy Fath, vice president of Marketing and Development.

¡°In both incidences the caller identified himself as ¡°Mario.¡± He does not work here and we don¡¯t solicit people for credit cards. We¡¯re making the public aware so that they do not provide any personal information to these callers.¡±

Caller ID spoofing is a manipulation of the caller ID feature that allows a scammer to disguise their true identity.

In this case, the caller is disguising himself as a representative of Davis Medical Center.

¡°Davis Medical does not make phone calls regarding a patient¡¯s personal credit card accounts,¡± Fath added.

If someone receives one of these calls, they should hang up and call Davis Medical Center¡¯s Patient Representative at 304-637-3773 for assistance.

A woman living in Lincoln was scammed out of ¡Ì2,500 after a call from a person claiming to work for her banking group, Barclays bank.

The caller told the woman on October 19 that they had to open a new bank account for her and that she needed to transfer ¡Ì2,500 into the account, which she did.

The woman was then told to attend an appointment at her local Barclays bank a couple of days later, but when she turned up she was told by staff they knew nothing about it.

This is one of several telephone scams that have been reported across Lincolnshire to police this month and they area reminding people to stay vigilant.

In a number of other cases the caller claims to be from either HMRC or the police, threatening an arrest, a lawsuit or telling the victims that they are under investigation, to get them to pay money.

Lincolnshire Police said: ¡°Please be aware that not all calls are the same and criminals can continue to change tactics.

¡°We are also asking for members of the public to tell their elderly family members and friends about of this fraud, and to raise as much awareness as possible.

NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar: Telephone scams that target victims across the region may soon be a thing of the past, as China looks set to join hands with ASEAN to run joint operations targeting these syndicates.

This comes after China and ASEAN countries agreed to crack down on such scams - including those that involve scammers impersonating Chinese officials.

The call was made at a meeting between China and ASEAN on Thursday (Nov 1), during the two-day ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime held in Naypyidaw.

In such scam cases, victims typically receive pre-recorded messages in Mandarin, before being directed to speak to a "Chinese official".

In other cases, victims receive calls from scammers pretending to be staff of telecom companies.

The scammers would then tell the victims their phone numbers were used illegally, before they phish out personal information from these victims.

China said syndicates behind such telephone scams also operate out of ASEAN countries, according to officials who attended the meeting.

READ: Two men charged for alleged role in China officials impersonation scams

In Singapore, the trend of such scams re-emerged in December 2017.

Speaking to Channel NewsAsia on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting, Singapore's Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin said ASEAN and China plan to organise joint operations to "cripple and weaken" these foreign syndicates.

"It's important that we have this partnership because crimes like scams - like credit for sex, love scams as well as impersonation scams - are quite difficult to investigate because most of these scams are done by syndicates overseas," Mr Amrin said.

"With this cooperation, this partnership involving ASEAN countries as well as China, it is beneficial in that we are able to extend the arms of the law and to have that concerted regional action and i think that's very helpful in combating transnational crime," he said.

A murder trial has been adjourned at the Central Criminal Court after jurors were targeted in what¡¯s thought to be a phone scam, where the caller claimed to be from the Courts Service.

The jurors were serving in the trial of a father-of-five, who shot his friend dead and dismembered his remains, which were later found in the Grand Canal.

The jurors had spent the first part of the day on Tuesday hearing the contents of garda interviews carried out with Paul Well Snr, who was denying involvement in Kenneth O¡¯Brien¡¯s murder.

The 50-year-old of Barnamore Park in Finglas has now admitted shooting dead his fellow Dubliner and dismembering his body. However, he has pleaded not guilty to murdering the 33-year-old at his home in Barnamore Park on 15th or 16th January, 2016.

He claims that the deceased had wanted him to murder Mr O¡¯Brien¡¯s partner, so that he could take their child back to Australia, where he had previously lived.

The jury heard evidence on Tuesday of what Mr Wells had said in half a dozen interviews, including telling gardai that they should go to Australia to find out why Mr O¡¯Brien was murdered. He also said he could not say why the deceased had transferred more than ¢æ50,000 into his account.

The 11 jurors were asked to go to their jury room while the parties arranged the next portion of interviews to be played on DVD. However, when they returned to court, they informed the judge of other developments.

The foreman said that both he and another juror had received missed calls from the same Dublin number in the space of half an hour. The other juror had also received a voicemail.

¡°It was distorted,¡± he said. ¡°You could just make out Courts Service.¡±

Mr Justice Paul McDermott sent the jury away again, later calling all 11 back to say that a preliminary investigation had indicated that the call was part of a scam.

He called the officer, who had carried out the enquiries, Sergeant Gerard Moore.

¡°It appears to be a scam,¡± he testified, explaining that people would dial the number from which the missed call would come.

¡°They¡¯re eliciting information as opposed to giving information,¡± he said of what would be heard on the other side.

Justice McDermott said that it appeared that it was nothing to do with the murder case and nothing to do with anything the jury had heard in court.

¡°I hope you¡¯re reassured by that,¡± he said.

He said that, in order for this investigation to be fully concluded, he would ask for the phones to be made available to a garda, who could listen to the voicemail.

¡°We can resume tomorrow when the investigation is completed,¡± he said, adjourning the murder trial until Wednesday morning.

Sgt Martin Long had testified earlier that he was involved in interviewing the accused following his arrest on suspicion of murder.

He said that Mr Wells said nobody else had access to his bank account and denied Mr O¡¯Brien had owed him any money.

He explained that he was in receipt of Jobseeker¡¯s Benefit of ¢æ320 a week and that the most he would have in his bank account would be a few hundred euro.

The gardai then asked if he could tell them about the ¢æ14,500 he had withdrawn from that account that January.

¡°No, I can¡¯t,¡± he replied. ¡°It¡¯s not in my possession anyway.¡±

He was asked if it had anything to with the murder of Mr O¡¯Brien.

¡°No,¡± he insisted. ¡°I wasn¡¯t involved in any of his activities.¡±

He agreed that the ¢æ52,925 that had been transferred into his account over the previous 18 months had belonged to Mr O¡¯Brien.

¡°A man was murdered. A lot of his money goes into your account,¡± remarked the gardai, explaining that they needed to find out what happened.

¡°You¡¯d better go to Australia then,¡± replied Mr Wells.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) ? The spam calls keep coming, but this one leaves a voicemail and it sounds like you should call them back.

The call, however, could cost you, CBS2¡¯s Clark Fouraker reported Thursday.

The call comes from a 10-digit number that looks domestic, but beware of area codes 809, which is in the Dominican Republic, 284, the British Virgin Islands, and 876, Jamaica.

¡°You¡¯re actually dialing internationally, and international rates apply. You can pay normal rates if you¡¯re calling a friend or family member, but there are also services called ¡®premium services,'¡± said John Breyault of the National Consumers League.

Those services could be lines dedicated to gambling or psychic readings. A new email warning says they leave a message that says, ¡°Hey this is Karen. Sorry I missed you. Get back to us quickly. I have something important to tell you.¡±

¡°It¡¯s very sad, and it¡¯s so many scams,¡± said Hope Chasin of the East Village.

¡°It¡¯s outrageous, of course, and AT&T or Verizon should block those calls and I¡¯m sure they¡¯re able to do it if they want,¡± Midtown resident David Pagar added.

The scams keep happening because the cost for scammers is so low. They can spam thousands of phones for next to nothing, and if just one person falls for the trick the scammers often walk away with a profit, Fouraker reported.

¡°Because of relationships they have with the phone company or the operator of that premium line get a kickback,¡± Breyault said.

That happens because the domestic and international phone company have paid each other for facilitating the international call. By the time you get your bill, you¡¯re the only one who hasn¡¯t paid.

¡°I tend to not call back any number that I don¡¯t know that haven¡¯t left a message just because of scammers,¡± Long Island resident William MacCloud said. ¡°People trying to charge me on my cellphone.¡±

The scammers bet on a small charge between $10-$30 not catching your attention. Experts say if you notice a charge on your bill to call your phone company and ask for the charge to be removed.

If the phone company won¡¯t drop the charge, experts say to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.

Most of the time when our phone rings we know who is on the other end. It may be a family member or possibly a friend and, if not either of those, likely some business or other contact we were expecting to hear from.

There are of course robocalls, which none of us like, but those are pretty easy to identify and hang up on. But what if you answered and the message was in Mandarin and it said to be from the Chinese consulate?

If you understand the language you might be a bit more inclined to pay attention, so when the voice says you need to take some steps in order to avoid any kind of trouble with the government, you might listen.

Unfortunately, it's all a scam

Like many attacks of this nature, they prey on people being confused or scared. Specifically, this scam tends to involve the call saying the consulate has an important document that needs to be retrieved, though it could also ask the person to provide information in order to avoid any kind of issue with the consulate.

Whatever the case, before the victim realizes what's going on, they have often wired a good amount of money to a Chinese bank.

A spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission told NBC News that there is no way to estimate this scam's scope, but reports have come in from all over the country. That led the Chinese embassy in the United States to provide an alert on its official website trying to help warn people about the scam, which it released back in April.

In part, it said:

"We would like to restate that the Embassy and Consulates General of China would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Embassy would not ask for bank account information."

Why is this one so effective?

Of course this scam, like most of its kind, takes advantage of people. But part of why it works is that the scammers use spoofing in order to make it appear as though their call is coming from a legitimate number, such as the Chinese consulate.

Add the fact that the call and message are in the Chinese language, and it's understandable why some would believe it to be legitimate.

One woman, who NBC News mentioned, ended up providing personal information including a name, address, age and Social Security number. With those details in hand, the scammers created what looked like a real arrest warrant, and they told the woman they would arrest her and remove her from the United States if she did not wire the money.

Only after sending the money did she look online and find out that the alleged arrest warrant was actually a document used in other scam attempts. She attempted to contact police in Hong Kong, which is where the money went, but they were unable to help.

However, through a little bit of luck, the transfer was frozen before it was submitted through the destination bank. She was able to recover the $95,000 she would have lost, save for the $80 wire fee.

Not everyone is as fortunate, so here's how to not become a victim

This specific scam targets people in the Chinese community, and in fact, the AARP reported in January that a great majority of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders age 50 and older said their families had been targets of fraud. Along those lines, one-third of all victims lost an average of $15,000.

But while this scam targets a certain community, in truth the methods to avoid it and others are very similar. It is important to understand that legitimate organizations, and especially governments, do not ask for sensitive information over the phone, nor would they require you wire money in order to settle an issue.

If you do receive one of the calls, it is a good idea to take a moment and do some research into it. If it is fake, chances are it will not take long to discover.

What to do if you've been scammed

When you realize you've been scammed out of money, there's no time to waste.

Contact the bank you used and see if it can stop the transaction. If you've purchased gift cards -- another favorite of scammers -- contact the company that issues the cards to see what they can do. You should also contact law enforcement -- local police or even the FBI -- if only to file a report that you might need later to make a claim.

More ways to stop phone call scams in their tracks

Ask your phone service provider if it offers a robocall blocking service. If not, encourage your provider to offer one. You can also visit the FCC's website for information and resources on available robocall blocking tools to help reduce unwanted calls. (Click here to learn how to block specific phone numbers.)

Many phone companies allow you to block calls that don't show a number on caller ID. Check with your provider to find out how to turn this feature on. Note: If someone you actually know calls you and blocks their outgoing number, their call won't make it through if you've turned this feature on.

This is actually the easiest solution to eliminating robocalls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them.

4. Subscribe to the Do Not Call Registry

This move will stop many robocalls before they begin. If you're on the registry, it's illegal for many robocallers to call you. Tap or click here to get your number into the National Do Not Call Registry. After your number is on the registry for 31 days, you can report unwanted sales calls.

If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you will receive more calls in the future.

You can also download and install call blocking apps such as NomoRobo, True Caller or Hiya on your smartphone. Tap or click here for more information about these types of apps.

New Zealanders are still being targeted by mysterious calls from international numbers as part of an elaborate scam that has been running over the last few years.

Dubbed the "Wangiri" scam, which translates from the Japanese to "one ring and cut", it involves con artists leaving missed calls on the user's phone from an unknown international number. Should the user call back, they are charged premium rates of up to $50 a minute.

This is not the first time such scam hit New Zealanders. As recently as February last year, there were reports of similar scams.

"The Wangiri call is when a scammer will call from a premium number and purposely hang up after one or two rings," she told the Herald.

"Because calls are billed typically from the time of answer, these attempts have no cost to the attacker. They will typically target mobile phones, as there is a higher likelihood that a mobile phone has caller ID display.

''The goal for the attacker is to entice victims to call back the number upon seeing a missed call. The perpetrators make money by collecting revenue on these calls via the premium rates issued by the overseas telecommunications provider, or by scamming victims on the return calls."

Arauzo draws a distinction between wangiri ruse and the increasingly common robo dialler scams, which are also present in New Zealand.

"The auto-dialler system enables the caller to systematically auto dial a list of numbers. If it picks up human activity on the other end it can either connect you to a person, or if there isn't someone available, it will be silent and then hang up."

While Arauzo said Spark customers "don't appear to be reporting a surge of this type of scam activity," she did say the telco is always vigilant in keeping an eye on these issues.

"Spark plays an active role in limiting the number of scam calls out there. When a scammer uses one number continuously, we identify and block that number."

The same also applies Vodafone, whose spokesperson Elissa Downey says they're also keeping an eye on scam activity.

"Unfortunately the 'wangiri' scam hits our shores from time to time, but we are not seeing a surge in this type of scam at the moment," said Downey.

"Our best advice is to avoid answering those numbers or any number you don't recognise or expect a call from and let the call go to voicemail. That way you can check if the message is from someone you were expecting or actually want to hear from. If the caller does not leave a message, ignore it and don't call the number back."

Beyond the missed call variation of the "wangiri" scam, Downey also recommends keeping an eye out for other scams.

"Another one to watch out for is an unsolicited call and someone starts engaging with you," Downey told the Herald.

"Typically, with this type of scam they are calling from overseas but sometimes they might spoof a New Zealand number, fixed or mobile, and they either try to sell you something or ask you for money."

Downey recommends users treat the interactions exactly the same as they would an unsolicited email.

"Simply hang up and don't engage," she said.

"It is really important to always be on your guard with callers you don't know ? if something seems a bit off or too good to be true, it usually is."

She also advises mobile users to notify their telco immediately if they have received a strange call or large charge.

"We work with the wider telco industry to block certain numbers from connecting through to customers phones if we know they are linked to a scam."

Downey finally recommends that users check the Consumer Protection website if they're in any doubt about whether something might be a scam.

Here's how to (try to) block them so they stop interrupting your grind.

You¡¯re not just imagining it: You're getting more robocalls.

Next year, almost half of all calls to cell phones will not be business calls or check-ins from loved ones, but scam calls. That grim forecast is according to First Orion, a company that makes caller ID and call-blocking software.

In 2017, First Orion estimated that about 3.7 percent of all calls to mobile numbers were spam. Today, they make up about 29 percent, but by early 2019, the company projects that proportion will skyrocket to 45 percent.

Some of the numbers for those incoming calls probably look eerily like your own phone number. (For me, the first six digits are often the same as mine.) That¡¯s to trick you into thinking the call might be coming from someone who lives near you, whom you might know. If you¡¯re like me, you¡¯ve wisened up to this trick, dubbed ¡°neighborhood spoofing,¡± and decline each call.

But for those who are fooled and answer, only to realize it¡¯s the same pesky automated call from the same familiar-looking number again, there are tools out there to block these spammy scams, one number at a time.

The deluge of unwanted calls disrupts our busy days. As a reporter, I¡¯ve more than once had my audio recording of an in-progress interview paused by an incoming call. Worse, they target individuals based on demographics, with attempts to convince immigrants they¡¯re in legal trouble or fraudulently persuade people to wire them money, posing as utility companies, charities and more.

More than half of all complaints the U.S. Federal Communications Commission receives pertain to unwanted calls, The Washington Post reports.

There are several ways to combat this onslaught, but be aware that the perpetrators of scams are savvy, and have found workarounds to number blocking and other measures individuals can take. For one, they don¡¯t honor the ¡°Do Not Call¡± list many households are on to thwart telemarketers. First Orion is in the process of developing new ¡°CallPrinting¡± technology, which it plans to implement through a major U.S. mobile carrier. Already, T-Mobile provides its subscribers with ¡°Scam Likely¡± caller ID messages.

As Entrepreneur described in a piece on banishing distractions earlier this year, an iPhone user can tap the blue circled ¡°i¡± symbol next to the number in their recent calls list and select ¡°Block this Caller.¡± Android users can hold down the number in their recent calls list, then select block. That is, until the next scam call comes in from a different number.

Scammers are flooding the United States with Chinese-language robocalls, causing major headaches from coast to coast.

These new robocalls are a lot like the ones you¡¯ve already gotten on your phone at all hours of the day and night: Your phone rings, you pick up, and after a brief pause or maybe a quiet click or beep, a prerecorded voice message meets your ears. The recording, which often sounds like a young woman, usually delivers a message about lowering credit-card rates or buying into cheap health insurance.

If you fall for the bait, you¡¯re transferred to a live human who will try anything to get you to hand over your credit-card or bank account info.

The important thing to remember is that sales robocalls are illegal in the United States. So, don¡¯t expect the person on the other end of the line to follow through on whatever deal they claim to offer. You¡¯re much more likely to fall victim to an identity theft scam or credit-card fraud than to score a deal from one of these spam callers.

The new Chinese-language version of these calls targets immigrants. The robocalls deliver a recorded message claiming to be from the Chinese consulate, saying the recipient is in trouble with Chinese officials, or sometimes that a package is waiting at the Chinese consulate that needs to be picked up.

Then, the robocall asks for a deposit or fee, demanding a credit-card number or bank information. Sometimes the robocall or live operator who follows it makes a threat, suggesting that more trouble will come if the person doesn¡¯t willingly hand over their financial info, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

In New York City alone, police estimate at least 30 residents had been scammed out of $3 million, according to National Public Radio.

The Chinese Consulate General in New York says it has posted dozens of alerts on its website warning about the scams. "We would like to restate that the Consulate General in New York would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Consulate General would not ask for bank account information," it warned.

The scammers are also upping the ante with a tech trick called ¡°spoofing.¡± Spoofed calls can fake caller ID numbers, making them look like they¡¯re coming from a familiar number, nearby area code, your hometown or in this case, the Chinese consulate, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which also issued an alert.

So, even if you don't speak Chinese, why would you get so many calls? The scammers don¡¯t know who they¡¯re calling, and it costs virtually nothing to place a phone call, so if they hit a few thousand English-speaking phones for every one Chinese speaker that¡¯s totally fine with them.

This scam uses many of the same ploys used on unsuspecting English speakers, say in the scam where the caller pretends to be from the IRS and is demanding payments on back taxes that don¡¯t really exist.

What to do:
?Never give money to any caller demanding it: If you speak Chinese and receive one of these threatening calls, never hand over your bank or credit card information, no matter how scary the recorded message might sound. Nobody ? including the Chinese consulate, the IRS and immigration officials ? will ever call you out of the blue to demand money, and they certainly won¡¯t pepper your phone with robocalls.
?Block numbers that hit you with repeated robocalls: If one specific number has been giving you a headache, you can block the number manually from your iPhone or Android smartphone. On the iPhone, click the little ¡°i¡± next to the number on your recent calls list and then tap ¡°Block This Caller.¡± On Android 6.0 or later you can find the number on your call history, tap it, then tap ¡°Block.¡±
?Use an app: Apps such as Nomorobo, Robokiller and YouMail, to name just a few, really can help curb robocalls. I use them, and they¡¯ve successfully thwarted thousands of spam calls to my cellphone. Many of the apps are free for at least a week, then cost around $2 a month or nearly $20 a year after that. (The apps present this to you as ¡°upgrades¡± or ¡°premium.¡±)
?Sign up for the federal Do Not Call list: The Do Not Call list is still your best bet for avoiding robocalls of all kinds, and that includes this new Chinese variant. I spoke with the FTC about the Do Not Call list and the many conspiracy theories that signing up for the list puts you at a greater risk of phone spam.

According to the FTC, getting access to the Do Not Call list not only requires valid sign-up information (you can¡¯t just request access to it anonymously) as well as an access fee. These are factors that push away scammers, and the FTC says it has never had to bring a robocall case against any company or group which has access to that list.

You might feel like robocalls are a never-ending disease, but the FTC already has had some huge wins in stemming the rising tide. The commission regularly hosts expos and forums to find new ways to stop the pesky calls and wages pricey lawsuits against telemarketers it catches using them. As recently as June the FTC nailed robocall operations that it says had made billions of robocalls.

Public warned not to answer phone calls from 'Wangiri' scam

Irish people have been targeted by a phone scam this week as fraudsters attempt to extract money from unsuspecting members of the public.

The scam - known as 'Wangiri fraud' - involves an unknown number calling your phone and leaving you with a missed call. When people call the number back, their phone credit is drained or a hefty charge is added to their phone bill.

Scams like this do the rounds every so often but the public are being warned not to be caught out by this latest one.

The calls are reported to be from Somalia and have a 00252 prefix.

The following advice should always be followed:
? Avoid answering calls from numbers that you cannot identify, especially if you are not expecting a call.
? Hang up immediately, on calls where there appears to be no recipient on the other end.
? Be wary of multiple calls being received from the same number.
? Do not call back any number that leaves you a blank voicemail message.
? Do not provide any personal information for example ? banking details/PPS number/credit card details/name and address/passport number etc.

Local law enforcement say someone is calling Texomans, claiming to be with the IRS demanding you pay up or face arrest from local officers.

Sherman police say they have received over 20 calls with questions about these scams in just the last two days, but that thankfully no one has fallen victim so far.

Paris Police have reported the same scam in their area this week.

The caller says local police will come to arrest you if you don't pay up immediately.

Police say if you get one of these calls, just hang up. The real IRS won't call you about a warrant.

If you've been contacted and wish to report this scam to the Federal Trade Commission, you can do so here.

Twenty-one people involved in a massive fraud and money laundering conspiracy were sentenced to up to 20 years in jail, the Department of Justice announced Friday, joining three other conspirators sentenced earlier this year. The operation, based out of call centers in India, targeted U.S. residents in telephone scams where they posed as representatives from the IRS. During the four years the operation was active, more than 15,000 U.S. residents were scammed out of hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 50,000 people had their personal information misused, the reports.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it the ¡°first-ever large scale, multi-jurisdiction prosecution targeting the India call center scam industry.¡± The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Treasury Department worked for years to shut down this fraud ring.

Between 2012 and 2016, the sentenced individuals used information obtained from data brokers and other sources to scam vulnerable populations, including immigrants and elderly persons. With a caller I.D. of ¡°U.S. Government,¡± conspirators posed as IRS or immigration officials over the phone, threatening arrest, deportation, or other penalties if the U.S. residents didn¡¯t immediately pay them through prepaid cards or money wire transfers.

If the victim agreed to pay their alleged debts, the money was routed through the call centers to a network of runners located in the U.S. The runners would then ¡°liquidate and launder the extorted funds as quickly as possible by purchasing reloadable cards or retrieving wire transfers,¡± the DOJ reports.

To help taxpayers avoid similar scams, the IRS provides a fact sheet explaining they will never call demanding immediate payment. Tax payments are always requested through mail, and taxpayers are given the opportunity to question or appeal the amount owed. The IRS said it will never threaten to have you arrested.

¡°The IRS also cannot revoke your driver¡¯s license, business licenses, or immigration status,¡± according to the fact sheet. ¡°Threats like these are common tactics scam artists use to trick victims into buying into their schemes.¡±

The 21 individuals sentenced in a Houston court last week were located throughout the U.S. during the scheme. The reports they resided in Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, Indiana, New Jersey, and Texas.

Twenty-two of the defendants have been held jointly liable for restitution payments over $8.9 million to victims of the scam, the DOJ reports. The court also included money judgements over $72.9 million in last week¡¯s sentences.

The court has also indicted 32 India-based conspirators and five India-based call centers with ¡°general conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy,¡± but no arraignments have taken place.

To be a step ahead of the latest scam? don¡¯t return a missed call from an international number you do not recognise.

This is the advice of advocate Jaqueline Fick? head of forensic services at Cell C.

This fraud? which can cost the caller R100 or R200 for single call? is "on the increase" in South Africa? she warned. Fick was speaking at the Annual Association of Certified Fraud Examiners African Conference in Sandton on Tuesday.

The way the fraud works is that scammers buy "premium" phone lines that charge a lot? such as R100 a minute? and then use software to send missed calls to hundreds of thousands of people.

A small percent of people return the call thinking they have missed an important phone call from a friend? relative or business abroad. What they don¡¯t realise is that it costs them up to a R100 or more a minute because they are dialling this ¡°premium number¡±.

The caller often hears someone pick up the phone and then may hear noise and be asked to wait while the person tries to get a clearer line. The scammer is trying to keep them on the phone for as long as possible. In some cases? scammers play the caller a recording of people fighting and the confused caller may stay on the line even longer trying to work out what is happening? explained Fick.

This fraud has a name: ¡°Wangiri Fraud¡± - which Fick said ¡°sounds like something you would put in a salad¡±. Wangiri is actually Japanese for ¡°one ring and drop¡±. This is what happens. Your phone rings and then stops before you can answer it.

May 30, 2018. Detective Superintendent Linda Howlett in Sydney says an international phone scam targeting Chinese expats has scammed more than $5 million from thousands of NSW residents. Det Supt Howlett says fraudsters are impersonating consulate staff, threatening violence and forcing their victims to stage their own kidnapping. ¡°We want to close this scam down,¡± Det Supt Howlett said. (AAP Video/Iain Boyd)

IN RECENT months, you may have been confused by a voicemail left on your phone in Mandarin.

Whether you understand it or not, authorities have warned smartphone users to hang up immediately.

Police have warned of a phone scam targeting Chinese nationals in Australia by pretending to be from the embassy and demanding a large sum of money.

News.com.au reported on the scam in detail earlier this week.

¡°We have offenders contacting victims on the phone purporting to be from the Chinese Embassy, and saying victims either committed an offence or had their identity stolen. As a result, victims are asked to pay fines or a debt,¡± Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Linda Howlett told a conference on Wednesday afternoon.

¡°I want to stress that the Chinese Embassy would never contact a victim to pay money over the phone.

¡°We¡¯ve had incidents where the victim is threatened, or their family back in China is threatened.¡±

She said there have been cases where the victim didn¡¯t have any money. In these cases, the victim was instructed to stage a kidnapping so they could get money overseas from their parents.

The scam has reaped in millions of dollars, targeting victims across Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. One victim in NSW had $1.9 million stolen.

According to Det Supt Howlett, there have been at least 50 reports of this incident across NSW, with three calls this week alone.

But she said a lot of the victims still aren¡¯t coming forward, urging people receiving the calls to hang up and let the authorities know.

Variations of this scam have been reported recently. In another one, an automated voice in Mandarin claiming to be calling on behalf of the Chinese Embassy tells the listener they had an important parcel to collect.

They are encouraged to press 9, at which point they are transferred to a scammer who tries to take their personal details.

China¡¯s Deputy Consul-General in Sydney Tong Xuejun said more than 1000 cases had been reported since August last year.

¡°We have confirmed about 40 cases that caused a loss. The total amount of money involved is about $10 million,¡± he said, adding that the money lost ranged from $2000 to one case of $3.5 million.

In another, the scammer tells the victim they are involved in a crime like money-laundering or embezzlement, and threatens them with jail or deportation unless they pay a hefty sum to get a ¡°priority investigation¡± to clear their name.

They also try to extract sensitive information like passport numbers, bank details and addresses.

According to Scamwatch, if the money is sent to the scammer, it is likely lost and extremely difficult to recover.

Many non-Chinese people have reported getting the calls too, and being left confused.

The Chinese Consulate-General has urged Chinese citizens in Australia to be aware of fraudulent calls.

State officials are warning Iowans not to fall prey to yet another phone scam in which they said someone is falsely impersonating "Iowa State Police."

The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is warning of a scam targeting citizens by misrepresenting the staff of the Iowa Department of Public Safety, according to a news release Thursday.



 DCI officials received reports that scammers are posing as employees of the ¡°Iowa State Police," claiming they have a seized vehicle with drugs inside and that the vehicle is registered to the person they're calling.

Individuals say they received multiple calls from the same 712 area code phone number, according to the news release.

If the person does not answer or hangs up on the initial call, a secondary call is being reported as coming from 911 and the scammers are verbally aggressive, claiming they are with the ¡°police,¡± and that they have a warrant for the individuals arrest, according to the release.

The calls are similar to a scam that targeted Dallas County residents in which a scammer said they were with the local sheriff's office.

Anyone who receives a similar phone call should contact local law enforcement and the Iowa Attorney General¡¯s Office Hotline at (515) 281-5926 or (888) 777-4590.

The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation offered the following tips to identify a scam:
? If you get a call from someone who claims they are collecting money on behalf of the Department of Public Safety ? even if a caller ID device shows the DPS ? hang up.
? The DPS does not demand immediate payment via prepaid debit cards.
? Do not provide or confirm personal information or financial information to anyone who calls.

Have you just received a phone call that appears to be from your own number? If so, it¡¯s likely a spoofed call that a scammer has set up in order to get you to answer their phone scam.

I can personally attest to this clever trick. I just recently got a call from my cell phone that claimed to be from my own number. Once I answered, I heard a message in an automated male voice, stating:

Apart from the weird phrasing (I¡¯m not sure what ¡°compromised by AT&T¡± is supposed to mean), there are a few ways to tell that this is a scam.
? First, robocalls aren¡¯t a common way for brands to contact their customers
? Next, the call never personally identifies whose account they¡¯re calling about, shifting the burden of identification to the listener ? this allows the scammer to record a one-size-fits-all message
? Finally, it asks for four social security digits ? personal information that a scammer often fishes for.

So why is this such a clever phone scam? Because it addresses the biggest challenge a phone scammer faces: How to get a victim to pick up the phone in the first place.

Personally, I never answer my phone if I don¡¯t recognize the number, and this attitude is growing among a younger generation, too. When texting, emailing, or even Facebook messaging are the go-to options, why bother answering an unknown caller? Because, this scam hopes, you¡¯re so confused by seeing your own number that you answer just to find out what¡¯s going on.

Then, the scam offers an easy explanation. The automated voice claims to be from your own phone carrier.

I do indeed use AT&T ? this scam potentially targets only AT&T customers, as this is still a huge base. Granted, it doesn¡¯t make a lot of sense that a phone carrier would call from its clients¡¯ numbers rather than their own, but it only has to make a moment of sense to trick a few people into giving up their social security digits.

If you want to avoid fielding scam calls all day, you have a few options.

If you don¡¯t pick up the phone when you don¡¯t recognize the number, you¡¯ll avoid this phone scam and any like it. The downside? Sometimes you¡¯ll miss a legitimate call.

Join the Do Not Call List

The federally run Do Not Call list is able to keep some ? but far from all ? robocalls away from your number. Since scammers aren¡¯t exactly concerned with staying legal, they¡¯ll likely keep calling, but you¡¯ll see a reduction in the number of automated calls.

If you¡¯re suspicious of a call, don¡¯t say very much. Even just a simple ¡°yes¡± in your voice could be recorded and played back by a scammer who wants to impersonate you.

Phone scams are getting worse. In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission logged 4.5 million complaints about robocalls in 2017 ? more than twice the 2.18 million complaints they saw in 2013, according to a recent New York Times article.

The call-from-your-own number AT&T-impersonating phone scam has been making the rounds since at least September 2017, as Good Housekeeping has covered in the past. A variation, where the phone number is spoofed to have the same area code, has been around even longer.

Scammers will keep using these scams as long as they¡¯re still working, so stay vigilant. Above all, if someone calls you from your own phone number, don¡¯t bother picking up.

MOLINE, Illinois -- A Milan woman said she was nearly duped by a scam phone call because the caller knew her Social Security number. The Quad City Better Business Bureau said it's part of a two-year-old phone scam that is resurfacing in the area.

Trisha Brooks, from Milan, Illinois, received a call Tuesday, September 18, while she was at work. The caller knew her Social Security number and demanded $1,800. The caller said she wrote a bad check and was going to be served papers if she didn't pay.

"They told me I owed money from eight years ago," Brooks said. " They said I needed to be in court and they were going to serve me papers for fraud and theft of services."

The call came from Chicago, Illinois and when the scammer said her Social Security number, Brooks was convinced it was a legitimate call.

"My mind was just spinning," Brooks said. "I thought I was in big trouble, so I asked them if I could just pay it." That is when the scammers told her the dollar amount and Brooks saw the red flags. She knew that was off and told the scammers she needed a bill to be mailed to her, then she hung up. After the call, Brooks searched the numbers online and found nine pages of people who received calls just like her.

The Quad Cities Better Business Bureau said that just because a caller knows your Social Security number, does not mean it is legitimate.

"If somebody calls you and wants money over the phone and you don't know who they are, don't give them any money, " Better Business Bureau Director Sandra Bowden said. "I don't care how they threaten you, I don't care what they say to you, don't do it."

The Better Business Bureau says that all legitimate businesses must provide billing and documents by mail and in writing. You can track popular scams in your area on the BBB Scam Tracker.

ENCINITAS, Calif. (KGTV) -- Police are investigating an elaborate phone scam that cost an Encinitas woman $1,400.

Lauren Kennedy says she was driving to work Wednesday morning when she received a phone call around 8:30 a.m. She says she had just gotten off the phone with her mother when all of a sudden, she was calling her back.

But when she answered, it wasn¡¯t her mother¡¯s voice.

¡°It was a man¡¯s voice telling me he had abducted my mother and he was going to kill her if I didn't do exactly as he told me,¡± Kennedy said.

Kennedy said it became so real when she heard her mother¡¯s voice on the other line.

¡°At that point, that¡¯s when I knew it was real," she said. "I heard her in the background, and I thought for sure that they had taken her.¡±

The man on the other line directed her to go to the nearest grocery store and put money into Money Pak cards. Then they demanded the card numbers over the phone and ordered her to destroy the cards afterward.

They told her to cut up the cards and email them photo evidence that they had been destroyed.

¡°At that time, he hung up and never called me back,¡± she explained. ¡°So, within a minute or two, I called my mom¡¯s phone and at that time, she answered.¡±

That¡¯s when Kennedy¡¯s realized she had fallen victim to an elaborate phone scam.

The Sheriff¡¯s Department says the scammers used a ¡°spoofing device¡± to make it look like the phone was made from her mother¡¯s phone number.

The scammers also called Kennedy¡¯s¡¯ mother in the middle of the fake ransom call. They got her worked up by saying they had her daughter.

¡°They just wanted her to be scared and sound scared. All I heard was her saying my name. I still can't believe it," Kennedy said. ¡°I think their whole intention with calling her was to have her voice in the background while they were asking me to do whatever they wanted me to do."

Kennedy says she not sure how the scammers got her information or her mother¡¯s. She says she is always careful with her information and weary of scams.

¡°I don't answer phone calls I don't recognize,¡± she said. ¡°I don't answer blocked numbers. I let people leave voicemails to determine if it¡¯s legit or not. I feel like the public needs to know about this (scam) because if I can fall for this, anybody can fall for this.¡±

In an email, to 10News the Sheriff¡¯s Department says people should hang up when they get phone calls like this and should immediately call law enforcement.

Kennedy says that's what her mother did when she got the call, but for her - it¡¯s easier said than done.

¡°This was life or death," she said. "They were threatening to kill my mom."

In a statement, the Sheriff¡¯s Department also wants to remind the public to be careful with their personal information:

¡°We also recommend not posting personal information such as phone numbers, family member names, addresses, school information, birthdays, etc. on social media. When in doubt, call the Sheriff's Department or your local law enforcement agency.¡±

The website of the Treasury inspector general for tax administration has an online form to report I.R.S. impersonations. It includes sections for reporting how much you paid to the perpetrators of the fraud, and whether you provided personal information. A personal identification number is assigned to the case so you can confirm that any agent who follows up is legitimate.

You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, which investigates consumer fraud.

If you¡¯ve been scammed and you file a complaint, you might be entitled to restitution if a court orders defendants to pay up. You¡¯ll only have a limited amount of time to claim losses, because the court may amend restitution orders for up to 60 days after sentencing. In the case of the India call centers, that date would be in mid-September. The claim form for that case is online.

If you used a wire transfer to pay a con artist, you should contact the wire transfer company. The MoneyGram Customer Care Center is 1?800?926?9400. The Western Union Fraud Hotline is 1-800-448-1492.

The I.R.S. generally contacts people by mail. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from the agency, do not open attachments or click on links. Forward it to phishing@irs.gov.

It is not always the I.R.S. that is being impersonated. Be aware, and learn to recognize a scam when you see or hear one.

The indictment pertaining to the Justice Department¡¯s recent convictions described other ploys used by the conspirators. Some calls were purported to be from immigration officials who threatened deportation unless bogus fines were paid. Another technique was to pretend to be a payday lender and promise a loan if a fee was paid upfront, and then the loan would never materialize, the indictment said.

Federal agencies have pages where consumers can browse scams by type, and the list suggests that there is no end to the creativity of crooked callers.

The St. George Police Department received several reports Wednesday afternoon regarding a possible phone scam wrongfully connected to a city number.

According to SGPD Officer Tiffany Atkin, the scammers may have "cloned" the City of St. George's phone number to reach out to businesses and individuals regarding their power bill.

Using the seemingly-legitimate number, the scammers speak to the individuals and urge them they need to pay their power bill within a short period of time or else it will be shut off.

Atkin said the individuals are then asked to meet at various locations across the city to pay. By Wednesday afternoon, one local business owner had been victimized by the scam, while several other residents simply called to report the calls as suspicious.

"People have called it in to report that it was suspicious," Atkin said. "Some haven't fallen for it. It looks like (the scammers) are targeting businesses for the most part, but they're also hitting private persons, too."

The investigation is in its early stages, Atkin said, and police are not yet certain how the scammers have gained access to the number.

There are no suspects at this time.

"We don't want any more victims," Atkin said.

A few hours after receiving a phone call from the person he thought was the Jasper County Sheriff regarding a contempt of court citation, Dr. Paul Sommer was still visibly aggravated by the time I arrived at his office.

The Valparaiso podiatrist also has a satellite office in DeMotte, a small town in Jasper County. So when the county sheriff¡¯s office called him about failing to appear for jury duty at the county courthouse, it sounded legitimate to Sommer, if not factual.

¡°I thought maybe it was mailed to my DeMotte office,¡± Sommer explained to me last week during my appointment with him at his Valparaiso office. ¡°But we don¡¯t receive any mail at that office address.¡±

The caller, who sounded rude yet confident posing as a county sheriff officer, told Sommer there was an open warrant for his arrest for failing to appear. And that an Oct. 3 court date was already set for Sommer¡¯s hearing at the county courthouse.

¡°Jury duty? Contempt of court? Bench warrant?¡± asked Sommer, who¡¯s one of the most level-headed and even-keeled people I know.

The call came from Remington, Ind., according to his office¡¯s caller ID. The officer¡¯s name was ¡°Ed Cox,¡± who even gave his badge number to Sommer.

¡°It all sounded weird, but¡¦¡± Sommer told me that day.

But¡¦ all it takes is a hint of plausibility to believe any phone scam. But¡¦ no one wants to casually ignore or dismiss the county sheriff. But¡¦ what if the phone call is actually legitimate, even with inaccurate details?

These are the questions that swirled through Sommer¡¯s mind when he took that call.

The caller told Sommer that his contempt of court citation and bench warrant could be expunged from the courts system if Sommer ? you guessed it ? paid the caller money. In this case, through two $500 ¡°vouchers¡± from a local pharmacy store.

Sommer and his staff immediately contacted that pharmacy and they also contacted police. They discovered what Sommer suspected all along.

¡°It was all a scam, targeting doctors, too,¡± he told me later that afternoon.

¡°It is definitely a scam,¡± Jasper County Sheriff Terry Risner told me afterward. ¡°I am truly sorry that this has caused people, such as your doctor, any heartache.¡±

His office has since posted a warning on its website, www.jaspercountypolice.com, which also lists several other phone scams.

¡°The Jasper County Sheriff¡¯s Office has received several complaints from concerned citizens reporting a new telephone scam circulating Jasper County,¡± the warning states. ¡°The Jasper County Sheriff's Office will not make telephone calls to individuals threatening arrest warrants and demanding money.¡±

The sheriff¡¯s office said people with questions about a scam should call the sheriff¡¯s office administration line is (219) 866-4950.

According to the Federal Trade Commission website, ¡°Every year, thousands of people lose money to telephone scams ? from a few dollars to their life savings. Scammers will say anything to cheat people out of money.¡±

That agency offers tips and warnings to avoid being scammed on a phone call. For more information, visit www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0076-phone-scams.

Sommer agreed to share his encounter with a phone scam caller with the hope it will help others be better prepared and a bit more skeptical of such calls.

¡°I admit, I was fooled at first,¡± Sommer said.

Before I left Sommer¡¯s office that day, he asked if I had ever considered hosting a public workshop for anyone interested in learning more about the craft of writing. I¡¯ve hosted many workshops through the years ? for connecting with media outlets and connecting with other people ? but never one specifically for writing.

¡°You should give it a thought,¡± Sommer told me.

After giving it some thought, I asked my social media readers if anyone would be interested in such a workshop. I received an overwhelming amount of feedback from aspiring writers, veteran journalists and others who simply want to transform their swirling thoughts and feelings into written words with better skill and more authenticity.

So I¡¯m arranging to host my first ¡°Writing 101 Workshop,¡± designed with a Power Point presentation and real examples from my work and other writers¡¯ work. The 60- to 90-minute workshop will be for new writers, veteran wordsmiths and anyone who wants to learn more about the art and science of writing.

I write at least 1,000 words every day for my newspaper columns, magazine stories and book projects, and I¡¯ll do my best to share what I¡¯ve learned over the course of my 25-year career. As you may know, I was not formally trained to be a professional writer, so my workshop will likely be informal and unconventional.

The Lake County Public Library¡¯s main branch on U.S. 30 in Merrillville has generously offered to host the workshop, with the tentative date of 1 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 10. I¡¯ve learned that this branch is centrally located for Post-Tribune readers across Northwest Indiana.

If you¡¯re interested in attending, feel free to register at the library or email me at jdavich@post-trib.com or text me at 219-713-7237. Or simply show up that day.

I¡¯ll provide more details and updates as that date nears, and thanks for your interest.

Finally, a sincere thank you to all the grandparents who contacted me after reading my recent column on becoming a new grandfather last month.

¡°I loved your honesty about not being so excited until the birth and about the fact that you were not going to write about it, but you did. Congratulations Pops!¡± wrote Kay Volkert, of Aurora, Ill.

I feel as though I¡¯ve been inducted into an elite, privileged club without doing anything for proper admission. I¡¯ll try to pay my dues by being the best Pops I can be.

Mobile phones in Kenya are like bank accounts - some people keep all their savings on their phone - and fraudsters are trying to hack into them to steal the money.

Sammy Wanaina received a text message on Sunday asking him to provide the secret personal code so that his Sim card could be swapped.

He was confused, he had not asked for a new card - and just moments earlier he had terminated a call that he now realised must have been from a fraudster who had posed as a customer services adviser from the phone company.

"It was a brief call and I did not give any of my details," Mr Wanaina told the BBC.

He immediately contacted Safaricom, his mobile provider, to report that he suspected that there was an ongoing attempted fraud on his number.

Despite not giving out his details - and reporting the fraud to Safaricom - he completely lost access to his number and only getting back control after three days.

He tweeted that the whole experience had scared him.

Mr Wanaina says Safaricom contacted him after his complaint and issued him with a new Sim card as a precaution - without giving further details about how he lost access to his number.

The company tweeted him to say it was "committed to safeguarding customer information and... that we will follow up this matter to its conclusion".

His story prompted others to share their experiences - many of whom had lost money in the scam.

Politician Stanley Wanjiku revealed that he had been trapped by the fraudsters, losing $18.000 (¡Ì14,000).

He told the Daily Nation newspaper that his trouble started after he received a notification that he could not access his mobile wallet and had to call a certain number to reset it - which he did.

He later learned that his Pin number has been replaced and a new one regenerated, so he could not get access to his money. The paper did not say which service he had his account.

"I do not know how my mobile money Pin was regenerated and issued to strangers. I am at a loss how they identified themselves," Mr Wanjiku said, adding that a bank account not linked to his mobile phone was also hacked.
? Why the mobile wallet failed in South Africa

People tend to have several Sim cards from different companies - as they have different coverage and deals. This means Sim cards do get damaged, so it's not unusual for customers to want to replace them.

Kenya has the highest number of users of mobile money in the world, a major reason why the recent Sim card fraud has caused such public alarm.

Almost half of its 47 million population use the dominant M-Pesa platform to pay for services and conduct businesses.

Through partnerships, phone companies have also managed to integrate mobile money services with banks, allowing customers to seamlessly move money back and forth.

William Makatiani, from the cyber-security consulting firm Serianu, told the Daily Nation that the scam to hack into mobile phones is becoming more common.

"Sim swapping has become a big problem especially in Nigeria since 2016. It started picking up in Kenya in the last half of last year," he was quoted as saying.

How to protect yourself

It is not clear how exactly the scam is working, but this week the Communication Authority of Kenya, the body that regulates the mobile phone industry, told users to be on their guard:
? Delete requests for financial information or passwords

Safaricom also urged customers to safeguard their passwords, dates of birth and national identity numbers.

It also said that subscribers should be aware of its official customer care number so as not to be duped by those trying to get access their account.

Cabel Sasser narrowly avoided having his bank account emptied last week by a swindler running an ATM card scam, an escape from a financial nightmare that he recounted in a string of tweets.

The attempted fraud was carried out by an unknown male phone caller who had Sasser's Social Security number and appeared to be calling from the security department at Wells Fargo, the bank where Sasser has an account.

The attack marked a more sophisticated variation on older scams and represents a cautionary tale for millions of American consumers. The results of a consumer poll on phone scams and spam issued in April 2018 by Truecaller, a mobile app that helps block unwanted calls, showed that an estimated 1 of every 10 U.S. adults had been victimized by a phone scam during the preceding 12 months, with an average loss of $357 per victim.

"Unfortunately, phishing scams like these are all too common, and the fraudsters can be convincing," said Sarah Grano, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association. "The best thing to do is trust your gut" and hang up if a call "seems suspicious."

Sasser, a co-founder of Panic, a software company and video game producer based in Portland, Oregon, said he was not suspicious at first. His cellphone's caller identification system showed the call apparently came from the 800 number listed on the back of his Wells Fargo ATM card.

A male caller identified himself as a fraud department agent and said the card had just been used for purchases at a Target store in Minnesota, more than 1,500 miles away from Sasser's home.

"It was a very smooth, very authentic-sounding call," Sasser said in a telephone interview. "I've had this happen so many times that I didn't even flinch at the fact that, great, another card got used someplace where it shouldn't be used."

Answering questions from the caller, Sasser said he had the card in his possession. The caller had him verify the card's security code. Then, the man read some disclosures related to obtaining a replacement ATM card. The procedure, familiar from previous security calls, "helped with the believability," Sasser said.

Next, the man asked him to key in a different personal identification code for the new card via his cellphone. That raised a red flag.

"There were no computer prompts or anything. I was just literally pushing numbers on my phone that he's just hearing on the other end," Sasser said. "I was starting to get a little nervous."

Finally, the man asked him to enter his current PIN number into the phone.

"That was the moment that pushed me over the edge ? something is definitely not right here," Sasser said. "I asked him point blank, 'Don't you know my PIN number ... you're the bank?'"

The man said he couldn't see the number and then tried to allay suspicion by reading the last four digits of Sasser's Social Security number. Sasser said the numbers were correct, but something was "very wrong."

Now all but certain he was being scammed, Sasser nonetheless said he reflexively shied away from being rude.

"Somehow, I found the courage to push through that hesitation," said Sasser. "I said, 'I'm sorry ... something about this seems weird. I'm just going to call the number on the back of my card."

The man sounded "kind of defeated" as the call ended Sasser said. But a real Wells Fargo representative was anything but crestfallen when Sasser called the bank's security office.

"I spoke to a guy who was incredibly happy that I had stopped when I did," because many people don't and lose money, said Sasser. "He definitely said 'there had been no attempted fraud on your card, and that whole story had been totally made up.'"

Such scams are anything but uncommon.

In all, 77,999 people who filed complaints with the federal Do Not Call Registry in 2017 reported imposter frauds from live callers, according to the Federal Trade Commission. An additional 179,925 complaints reported similar frauds from recorded robocalls.

The Truecaller poll from April found that 18 percent of the respondents who said they had received scam calls during the preceding 12-month period cited bank problems, including calls that sought sensitive information about accounts.

In many cases, the scammers have already gathered information about potential victims, said Lauren Saunders, the Associate Director of the National Consumer Law Center. Social Security numbers can be bought in bulk on the Dark Web and other sites. Phone numbers for security departments at a bank, or other companies, can be spoofed so they appear on caller ID systems.

"Caller ID can be programmed to say whatever someone wants it to say," said Amy Nofziger, an AARP expert on consumer frauds.

Wells Fargo declined to comment on the phishing call reported by Sasser. However, the San Francisco-based bank said scams are "becoming more commonplace."
? Banks won't ask for PIN codes, so be suspicious of a call from anyone who does, said Nofziger. And don't shy away from confronting a suspected scam caller. "It is not rude to take control of the situation and take control of your financial security," she said.
? If you receive a phone call seeking information or access to an account, hang up and contact the financial company by using the number on your ATM card or on the firm's website, Wells Fargo said.
? Don't provide your account information or Social Security number to anyone who contacts you by phone or online, the American Bankers Association said. Use a combination of letters and numbers for passwords, and change them frequently.

Reflecting on the incident, Sasser said the scam was more sophisticated than anything he'd previously encountered. That's one of the reasons he shared the details.

"It tells me that the thieves are getting smarter, which means that we have to be getting smarter," he said.

COLD SPRING -- A recent phone scam is circulating in Cold Spring and it's fooling people into thinking they're talking to a local person.

Cold Spring Police Chief Jason Blum says they've received several calls last month and this month about an IRS phone scam. Many of the calls are appearing as local numbers.

"They [the scammers] are using computerized dialers so they can make it look like a local phone number and we've had some come up as local businesses on the caller ID so people actually think they are talking to someone that they may or should know. Which is not the case, they're disguising their phone numbers which make it difficult for us to track anything down on our end."

Blum says the scam is like many others that claim you either owe money to the IRS or need to bail someone out of jail.

"The big one right now is you have back taxes from the IRS and local law enforcement have a warrant out for your arrest if you don't give us the money. So we're just trying to inform people about what's going on. A lot of these scams are happening and people are still spending money on them."

Many of the scammers tell people they need to mail gift cards out of state to cover their back taxes or bail someone out of jail. Police would like to remind you that the IRS or any law enforcement agency will never accept gift cards as payment.

The best way to protect yourself is to ask questions. If you suspect it's a scam call the police.

It may be summer, but the bad guys aren¡¯t taking a vacation. The Acting Inspector General of Social Security, Gale Stallworth Stone, has issued a warning about an ongoing phone scam from thieves pretending to be from the Social Security Administration (SSA).

As part of the con, scammers try to convince you to give up personal information, like Social Security numbers and bank account numbers, over the phone. In another case, a caller claims to be from ¡°SSA headquarters¡± and asks you to confirm personal information, such as an SSN, "new" Medicare number, address, and date of birth.

Many of these calls are ¡°robocalls¡± or automated calls. In one robocall version of the scam, an automated recording declares that your Social Security number (SSN) ¡°has been suspended for suspicion of illegal activity,¡± and advises to contact a specific phone number immediately. The robocall or caller may also warn that if you don¡¯t call back, your assets or benefits will be frozen until your alleged issue is resolved.

Robocalls from scammers pretending to be from government agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), continue to be problematic. They are cheap and easy and allows thieves to reach the largest number of victims possible.

You may recall that a "Robocall Strike Force¡± was established in 2016 to develop solutions to prevent, detect, and filter unwanted robocalls. The task force was made up of communications companies including cell and landline service providers, phone manufacturers, operating system (OS) developers and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Members included such communications leaders as Apple, Bandwidth, Comcast, Google, Microsoft, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, two years later, there doesn¡¯t seem to be any real progress made to stop robocalls.

According to an FCC spokesperson, "This industry-led effort produced two detailed reports to the Commission and which were instrumental in laying the groundwork for both on-going FCC policy-making efforts and industry technological work. FCC work that used the Strike Force¡¯s recommendations includes work to reduce robocalls to reassigned numbers, the new FCC rules allowing phone companies to proactively block calls that are likely to be fraudulent, and FCC work to encourage implementation of call authentication. The Commission continues to consult with a wide variety of stakeholders though there are no current plans to formally reconvene this group. Rather, the Strike Force¡¯s reports served their purpose by spurring and framing on-going Commission and industry action to help consumer avoid illegal robocalls."

The FCC has issued some tips for dealing with robocalls. They include:
? If you answer the phone and the caller - or a recording - asks you to hit a button to stop getting the calls, you should just hang up. Scammers often use this trick to identify potential targets.
? Do not respond to any questions, especially those that can be answered with ¡°Yes." (You can find out more about the dangers of saying ¡°yes¡± to robocalls here.)
? Talk to your phone company about call blocking tools they may have and check into apps that you can download to your mobile device to block unwanted calls.
? If you use robocall-blocking technology already, it often helps to let that company know which numbers are producing unwanted calls so they can help block those calls for you and others.
? To block telemarketing calls, register your number on the Do Not Call List.

In the meantime, robocalls and phone calls made by scammers and thieves continue to be problematic. It¡¯s especially confusing because the IRS has repeatedly advised taxpayers that they will not reach out by phone to resolve taxpayer issues. However, SSA employees do occasionally reach out by telephone for customer-service purposes. Further, the SSA says that in ¡°a few limited special situations¡± which are ¡°usually¡± already known to the citizen, an SSA employee may confirm personal information over the phone.

The Acting Inspector General of Social Security, Gale Stallworth Stone, warns folks to be cautious, and to avoid providing information such as your SSN or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are certain of who is receiving it. ¡°Be aware of suspicious calls from unknown sources, and when in doubt, contact the official entity to verify the legitimacy of the call,¡± Stone said. The SSA advises that if you receive a suspicious call from someone alleging to be from SSA, report that information to the OIG at 1.800.269.0271 or online.

I would go a step further: When in doubt, assume it¡¯s a scam. If you¡¯re not sure whether a call is legitimate, hang up and call back using an official number (don't just use the caller ID number on your phone since those can be spoofed). To reach IRS, call 1.800.829.1040. To contact Social Security, call 1.800.772.1213.

If you know that it¡¯s a scam, don't engage with scammers or thieves, even if you want to tell them that you know it's a scam, or you think that you can best them. Just hang up.

The IRS says that phone scams are still "a major threat to taxpayers." In early 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Remember that the IRS will never:
? Call to demand immediate payment over the phone, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.
? Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
? Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
? Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.
? Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

The phone call in early June purporting to be from Chinese authorities was, in a word, alarming. The Massachusetts woman who answered it learned she may have been the victim of identity theft.

But after almost a week of corresponding and sharing personal information over the phone in an effort to find how her identity had apparently been stolen things went very wrong very quickly.

¡°It turned from trying to be helpful, as you potentially are a victim of identity theft in China, to there¡¯s an international arrest warrant out for your arrest,¡± said Jeremy Warnick, director of communications and media relations for the Cambridge Police Department.

The woman, whom police did not identify, ended up wiring $95,000 to a bank in Hong Kong to avoid what she thought would be her arrest and removal from the U.S., according to Warnick.

Only after did she realize she had fallen victim to a phone scam.

A popular version of the ruse, which appears to have taken off earlier this year, involves a robocall message in Mandarin that identifies itself as the Chinese consulate and tells the person who picks up that there¡¯s an important document to retrieve.

It may also direct recipients of the call to provide information to avoid getting into trouble with the consulate, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

Asked about the extent of the Chinese consulate scam, FTC spokesman Frank Dorman said in an email that there¡¯s ¡°no way to estimate the scope of any kind of fraud.¡±

But reports of it have come in from across the country, from New York to Massachusetts to California, prompting the Chinese embassy in the U.S. to issue an alert on its official website.

¡°We would like to restate that the Embassy and Consulates General of China would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls,¡± read the advisory, dated April 19. ¡°The Embassy would not ask for bank account information.¡±

A big part of the scam¡¯s success involves what¡¯s known as spoofing, a process in which scam artists make it appear as if a call is originating from a legitimate phone number, like that of the Chinese consulate.

Around a half year ago, legislation sponsored by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., was signed into law as part of the omnibus spending bill that makes such spoofing attempts from abroad a criminal act.

Meng, whose district covers a swath of the New York City borough of Queens, home to a large Asian-American population, called the law a ¡°first step¡± in penalizing overseas con artists who try to scam people in the U.S. through spoofing.

The bill became law in March, right around the time her office began fielding reports about the Chinese consulate scam, which appeared mostly to be targeting people with Chinese-sounding surnames.

¡°These folks, they probably tend to trust the Chinese consulate, they¡¯re speaking in their language,¡± Meng said. ¡°It¡¯s easier, I think, to scam people when they¡¯re talking in their own language.¡±

Meng¡¯s office said they¡¯ve received a few dozen reports from constituents about the Chinese consulate scam, including one who said they lost $1.5 million. The congresswoman added that, for this particular scam, it appears that the number of phone calls in her district has dropped since springtime, when there was an onslaught of them.

The New York Police Department did not respond to requests for comment about the scam.

It¡¯s unclear what effect the anti-spoofing bill has had so far on deterring or prosecuting scam-artists overseas since it was signed into law.

Apart from imposing criminal penalties, the legislation requires the Federal Communications Commission, together with the FTC, to regularly update materials to help consumers identify and protect themselves from caller-ID scams.

Meng also sent a letter to the FTC in May, calling for its online complaint assistant to be made available in Chinese. (The website has only a Spanish-language option.)

Dorman, the FTC spokesperson, said the agency doesn¡¯t comment on correspondences it receives, but did reference online FTC literature in Chinese that informs consumers specifically about the consulate scam, scams against immigrants and wiring money overseas.

Back in Cambridge, authorities hadn¡¯t seen too many instances of scammers pretending to be the Chinese government, said Warnick, the Cambridge Police Department spokesperson.

The woman targeted in June had corresponded with the fraudsters for around a week through voice and text, according to Warnick. They even asked her to get a temporary cell phone from which she could make international calls.

Over the week and using that phone, the scammers got the Cambridge woman to divulge more and more personal information, including her name, address, age and social security number, Warnick said.

They then plugged those details into what looked like a legitimate arrest warrant in simplified Chinese characters, which Warnick said they texted to her.

They told the woman they were in Cambridge and that if she didn¡¯t proceed with a money transfer, they would arrest her and kick her out of the U.S., according to Warnick. After wiring the money, the woman searched online and found that her purported international arrest warrant was a document used in other scam attempts across the country.

She tried contacting police in Hong Kong, where she had transferred the money, but they weren¡¯t able to help, according to Warnick. Then the woman called the Cambridge Police Department.

¡°She was frankly so embarrassed she didn¡¯t even notify family or friends that she was a victim,¡± Warnick said, adding that the woman was not elderly, an age group that often falls prey to such scams.

Fortunately, she had at a few things going in her favor.

One was that the transfer took place over the weekend, when banks tend to be closed. Another was that a Cambridge Police Department detective just happened to be friends with an IRS agent stationed in Hong Kong, Warnick said.

The detective notified the IRS official about the transfer and its size, according to Warnick.

¡°That particular agent worked with local police to freeze the transfer before ultimately it was successfully submitted through the destination bank,¡± Warnick added.

In the end, the woman got back her $95,000, except for the $80 wire fee. The case has since been handed over to the FBI, Warnick said.

Not every victim is as lucky. Warnick said that in Cambridge, a city across the Charles river from Boston with 110,000 residents, police receive an average of 10 to 15 reported telephone internet scams each week.

¡°We believe that the magnitude of it is much higher because a lot of these aren¡¯t reported,¡± Warnick added, citing such reasons as embarrassment.

A report released in January by AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for the aging, found that an overwhelming majority of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders age 50 and older said they or their families have been targets of fraud, while a third of all victims lost on average $15,000.

Meng said educating residents is most important in preventing people from becoming victims of scams, which are not just limited to impostors pretending to call from the Chinese consulate.

One of the more prevalent schemes includes thieves impersonating Internal Revenue Service personnel who disguise their phone numbers to make it seem like they¡¯re calling from the IRS. They then demand immediate payment for unpaid taxes, according to Meng¡¯s office.

Warnick said the non-emergency number of the Cambridge Police Department has even been spoofed.

So-called blessing schemes have also been used to prey on members of the Chinese community, especially the elderly. Fraudsters tell their victims that a death curse has been placed on them and that the only way to remove it is by forking over cash and jewelry.

Warnick, whose police department has nearly 280 officers who speak 14 languages, said they hold regular seminars for seniors in particular to help them understand the latest trends in scams and what to do to protect themselves.

But he added that it can be challenging trying to reach residents for whom English is a second language.

There is ¡°somewhat of an intimidation factor in terms of contacting local police and working with local police, especially during these times of immigration concerns,¡± Warnick said.

¡°But certainly we as a department make ourselves available to go wherever people feel like they need support, whether it¡¯s a community meeting, or with a small group, in a home, whatever it may be, we¡¯ve done all of the above,¡± he said.

The Social Security Administration issued a warning today about an ongoing Office of the Inspector General (OIG) impersonation scheme. The scheme echoes a pattern where thieves pretend to be from government agencies, like those involving scammers posing as callers from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In the most recent scam, folks are reporting suspicious phone calls allegedly from the OIG. Specifically, the caller identifies as ¡°Gale Stone¡± and states the person¡¯s Social Security number (SSN) is at risk of being deactivated or deleted. The scammers are hoping that name sounds familiar: the Acting Inspector General of Social Security is Gale Stallworth Stone. It's also worth noting that Social Security numbers don't have an expiration date, and you don't have to re-activate or confirm them for them to be valid.

While variations on the scam exist, typically the caller advises the victim to call a particular phone number to resolve the issue. Do not call the number or engage with the scammer (even if you think you can get the better of them). The better tack is just to hang up. You can also report the information to the OIG at 1.800.269.0271 or online.

Above all, the real Inspector General Stone urges you to be cautious and to avoid providing information such as your SSN or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are sure who is asking.

The same rule applies to those alleged IRS phone calls. When in doubt, assume it¡¯s a scam. If you¡¯re not sure whether a call is legitimate, hang up and call back using an official number (don't just use the caller ID number on your phone since those can be spoofed). To reach IRS, call 1.800.829.1040. To contact Social Security, call 1.800.772.1213.

The IRS says that phone scams are still "a major threat to taxpayers." In early 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Many of us have heard of phone scams targeting residents, but the latest one threatens to have local cops arrest you.

I sat down with a former assistant attorney general of Louisiana who wants to let the elderly know of this scam.

Col. Jeron J. La Fargue, retired Attorney at Law, says, "The main thing is unfortunately there are people in the world who will try to take advantage of senior citizens."

"This is the voicemail that elderly people in the area are receiving trying to extort money from them:¡±

"This is a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in the next 24 working hours and once again, if it expires, you will be taken under custody by the local cops."

"An elderly person who does not have my background would think that it's true that someone is going to come knock on their door, police and take them into custody," La Fargue says.

The Better Business Bureau says the number the scammers are calling from is not local.

Jenn Love, with the Better Business Bureau of Acadiana, says, "It's funny because they'll call from a non-local number and they'll say the local cops are coming but they won't say what parish or what city they're even living in it's just very generic that the local cops are coming."

"I'm not sure that they could arrest them because they're out of the country but the main thing is for people to understand that it is a scam," explains La Fargue.

"Some people think just because they have your name and they know their phone number that they have all this information, they'll volunteer it thinking they already have it and that's not the case. Don't give out any of your personal information," Love adds.

In order to avoid this threatening phone scam, here are some suggestions from the Better Business Bureau:
? None Don't give out any personal information, including your name, address, or especially your banking information.
? None Don't trust your caller ID. Scammers now have the technology to take the caller ID and distort it to any number.
? None Government agencies will not call you. They will send you a letter if they need to contact you.

I was traveling recently when I got a phone call letting me know that the Internal Revenue Service apparently wants to throw me in jail.

If there is one thing you can hear while you're on the road that is worse than the thump of a flat tire or the clatter of an engine breakdown it's the voice of an IRS agent who is insisting you're going to do hard time.

And I was on the move, so you could say that from the moment I answered the call I was on the lam. I was fleeing the law. Since I was traveling on an Interstate, it was sort of a high-speed getaway. Great, not only did I need to make sure I was keeping to the speed limit in case I encountered a state trooper, now I had to keep an eye out for federal agents in official-looking cars accompanied by anyone who looked like an IRS accountant.

"There's the one! That's the guy whose numbers were obscured by coffee stains on his tax return ..."

In all honesty, I'm not sure if spilled java during late-night and last-minute tax filing work was included in my law-breaking. When the call came in I was driving in a rainstorm in a hands-free telephone state, so I listened to it for only a few seconds through the vehicle's audio hookup before hanging up on what appeared to be the recorded voice of a woman who seemed to be linguistically challenged in English. I understood what she said. Still, some of the grammar seemed to be a little bit off for someone chosen by the IRS to communicate with the public.

She said that I had four serious infractions and, essentially, the IRS was tracking me down. She didn't say what those infractions were, but the tone was accusatory. In fact, she told me that if I didn't call the IRS back I would be arrested by the local "cops."

It was then that I pressed the "hang up" button on my SUV's dashboard radio. I was approaching a tractor-trailer. Better that I be cuffed in the privacy of my home than be cut off by a truck driver who couldn't see me in his spray.

After ending the call, however, I wasn't very worried. The woman's charges seemed too unbelievable. I couldn't see how I could break four laws on one tax form. I don't earn that much. I didn't even itemize. I filed the short form. I didn't have room on one piece of paper ? filling out both the front and back ? to be too much of a criminal, even by accident.

Besides, I've read a lot in the last few years about IRS phone scams. Callers seek personal information or demand payments of unpaid taxes over the phone by using debit cards. The callers refuse to entertain questions about the required payments or incorrectly insist that the IRS allows no appeal of the alleged tax code violations. If a scamming victim protests, the callers threaten to bring in local law enforcement. But, I'm guessing real IRS agents wouldn't call those officers "cops."

And, later I went online to the IRS website and saw that these scams occur throughout the country. I know this to be a fact because a second call from the same number came in later in my drive and I was in a different state. This time I listened to it the whole way through. It's interesting what a guy will do for entertainment on a long drive.

The call sounded even more like a scam when I heard it in its entirety. I'm writing about it only as a warning to people who might fall victim to such a call, handing over money because four infractions seems serious.

Nevertheless, I warn you, on the slim chance that it wasn't a scam, and "cops" come to my door, you might be waiting a few years for the next column.

Criminals come up with some pretty sneaky ways to rip us off. You'd think eventually they would run out of ideas. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case.

There's no sign of them letting up anytime soon. Many times, crafty crooks will take a version of an old scam and tweak it just enough to make it seem new.

That's actually happening right now. A new twist on an old school phone scam is tricking people all across the country and costing victims tons of money.

A California police department put out a scam alert this week. It's warning everyone that criminals are calling people and pretending to be representatives from big box retailer Costco.

What's happening is that the caller offers you a $500 Costco Travel Credit or Costco Cash Card for just taking a brief survey. During the survey, you're asked for a bunch of personal information.

The problem is that they aren't actual Costco representatives. It's a scam.

If you fall for it and give out your information, the scammers use it to commit identity theft. And it's not just going around California, it's all across the U.S. The thieves are thought to be based in California, but are using spoofing technology that makes the incoming call look like it's from your city, no matter where you live in the country.

The first thing to do if you receive a scam phone call is report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This will help shut down any ongoing phone scams. You can call the FTC to report it at 1-877-382-4357. Keep reading for more ways to protect yourself.

This is actually the easiest solution to eliminating scam phone calls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them.

Many phone companies allow you to block calls that don't show a number on caller ID. Check with your provider to find out how to turn this feature on.

Note: if someone you actually know calls you and blocks their outgoing number, their call won't make it through if you've turned this feature on.

If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you will receive more calls in the future.

You can also download and install call blocking apps such as NomoRobo, True Caller or Hiya on your smartphone. Click here for more information about these types of apps.

Many phone scams begin with a robocall. Criminals use this technique to find new victims all the time.

Listen to Kim's free podcast on ways to outsmart robocallers

You¡¯ve heard them -- the annoying robotic calls that try to scam you with free vacations or false threats from the IRS. In fact, it is estimated that scammers make 2.5 billion robocalls in one month alone. This poses a very real risk to consumers as it gets harder to identify and avoid malicious automated calls. In this Komando on Demand podcast, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family from falling victim to these tricky and downright dangerous phone calls.

Test your firewall to make sure it¡¯s working

Your firewall is an essential tool that keeps hackers from seeing your computer online. Even if they know your computer's location and IP address, the firewall keeps them from accessing your network. But many don't know if they have a firewall or not, or if it's actually working. Here's a quick way to test your network to make sure you're protected.

Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig is warning residents to be wary of fraudulent, scam phone calls where the caller pretends to be from Costco Wholesale and offers a travel voucher, cash card or reduced travel package in exchange for your personal information.

This scam is targeting both members and non-members of Costco Wholesale where the fraudsters are attempting to collect personal information. The caller, pretending to work for Costco, offers either a $500 Costco travel credit or a Costco cash card as a reward for completing a survey.

These fraudsters are likely using software to show a local phone number on the caller ID while hiding the real phone number of where the calls are originating from. This tactic, called spoofing, tricks the resident into wanting to pick up the phone, thinking that the caller is located locally.

The personal information these fraudsters are trying to obtain can be used against you to commit identity theft in an effort to steal your money. Costco Wholesale has confirmed that these callers are in no way affiliated with Costco or Costco travel.

¡°Telephone scams have become more sophisticated than ever,¡± Reisig said. ¡°Nobody is immune from being targeted by these persistent crooks and everyone could be affected by these calls. The best defense against becoming a victim of such a scam is knowledge and vigilance. It¡¯s OK to say ¡®no¡¯ to these persistent crooks.¡±

But experts say there is an easy solution to fix the phone ¡°port-out¡± fraud, in which scammers steal a victim¡¯s personal information and use it to switch their mobile number to another phone company.

Having control of the mobile number and the ability to intercept calls and messages, scammers then request a password reset of the person¡¯s bank and email accounts using two-factor authentication where a text message is sent.

Sunshine Coast University Professor of Cybersecurity David Lacey said victims usually found out when their phone went to ¡°SOS¡± mode.

He is also the managing director of IDCARE, which helps scam victims.

New figures show more than 1000 calls for help to IDCARE in the past year over port-out complaints and a spike in the last quarter.



Scammers often use phone or email scams or stolen mail to access personal information before making a port-out attempt.

¡°In some cases telcos send messages saying you are about to be ported but unfortunately when messages are sent porting is already taking place and won¡¯t be stopped,¡± Mr Lacey said.

In most port-out scams, the criminal produces a licence number for verification, or a passport or Medicare number to telcos.

Once a victim¡¯s bank account is accessed, money is normally transferred to another domestic account (fraudulently set up in another person¡¯s name) and then offshore.

Mr Lacey said fraud could easily be reduced if mobile phone users were sent a yes/no port-out option.

Brisbane woman Georgina Gofton¡¯s phone number was hijacked last week and her email was accessed.

¡°While we were on the phone to Telstra, I started receiving alerts on my email that it had been accessed and the password had been changed and they had used my phone number to get a verification code (to reset the password),¡± Ms Gofton said.

¡°There should be some more checks and balances in place.¡±

Ms Gofton said she was fortunate to not have her bank details in her email but scammers accessed personal information. She has since changed her number, deactivated the email account and changed other account passwords.

¡°It¡¯s compromised other people¡¯s information as well,¡± she said.

In another case, a Brisbane woman had her mail stolen before her phone was ported. Within minutes of the porting from Optus, more than $5000 was stolen from her bank account.

The phone company offered a six-month credit but she is yet to get her money back.

Financial and Cyber Crime squad Detective Sergeant Kris Steadman said 36 cases had been reported to the Queensland Police Service this year.

Port-out fraud had become more prominent with the introduction of two-factor authentication, he said.

¡°Generally porting of a mobile only occurs after an offender has accessed emails or obtained harvested credential,¡± Det Sgt Steadman said.

¡°The hacker/scammer may obtain bank login details from the compromised email, access the banking application and, as the phone number has been ported, they receive the two factor authentication message as opposed to the genuine subscriber.¡±

Federal Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said: ¡°The telecommunications industry is working with financial institutions to put in place a range of new measures to improve customer security and reduce the incidence of fraud using access to mobile devices¡±.

A Telstra spokesman said customers who have received a port out request were sent an SMS before the port-out happens. An Optus spokeswoman said the company followed industry-agreed processes regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority to validate the porting of numbers.

You've probably received a scam phone call in the past, but recently some people are getting calls in Mandarin.

Groups who work with newcomers are warning about phone calls that appear to be trying to scam people and get your personal information.

The voice speaks in Mandarin, either live or recorded, and says there is a package to be picked up and asks for personal information.

The P.E.I. Association for Newcomers to Canada said it's heard from people in the community who have received phone calls, and even their staff have gotten calls.

'No, that's definitely a scam'

"I received that call too and it's basically asking me, like, you have important packages. If you want to retrieve it, please dial 9 to get more information," said Nicole Li, who is a settlement worker with the association.

"But like no, that's definitely a scam so I just hung up. So later on in the day, I also heard from other people from the community about the same messages that they received," she said.

Ally Guo, owner of a local publication that helps newcomers navigate the Island, www.GiGiGu.com, posted a warning to people on their website and social media.

She's heard from 50 people who have had similar calls.

"Actually I received a call myself. I received the call and then I have to tell my friends not to be cheated by this kind of call. That's why I spread the news out," Guo said.

Guo said there are 3,000 people following the publication's online accounts and she wanted them to hear about the calls in case they might receive one.

P.E.I. RCMP said if you get a call asking for personal information, making threats for payment or any other obvious scam, you should just hang up.

Island RCMP said if you haven't experienced a loss, there is no need to make a report to them.

Police say most of these calls are made by automated dialers that could target hundreds of people a day, and if everyone notified police, they would be overwhelmed.

Fraud attempts can be reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. You can also check out their website to keep up with the latest scams that are being attempted.

The number of phone scams is on the rise, police say.

They are warning people of a new scam where the caller claims to be from the police and Spark and tries to access victims' computers and bank accounts.

Detective sergeant Damian Rapira-Davies said the scammer told victims their computer had been illegally accessed or used for criminal purposes.

The call is then transferred to someone claiming to be from the Organised and Financial Crime Agency (OFCANZ) arm of the police, who gives instructions on how to allow them access to the victim's device.

"Whether the scammer purports to be from the Department of Immigration or the Chinese Embassy or one of dozens and dozens of stories that are used, each story is designed to create anxiety for the person who answers the phone," Mr Rapira-Davies said.

He said OFCANZ had been renamed and was no longer used within the police.

Mr Rapira-Davies said often older and more vulnerable members of the community were the ones who were targeted.

"We have certainly tried to do a lot of work to try and advise the public [of scams]," he said.

Mr Rapira-Davies said anyone who was a victim of a scam, whether through the phone or online, should immediately report the scam to their bank and the police.

"That money may not have left the country, it may be still in transit, it may be able to be frozen and reversed so [the bank] is the first port of call if someone has been scammed."

SUNSET HILLS, MO - A common phone scam nearly costs a Sunset Hills couple thousands of dollars. But a quick-thinking local courier service stopped the crime from happening.

Nick Kirkou, owner of Ontime Express Courier and Delivery said he had a feeling, that the Monday morning call his dispatcher took from a guy about a package delivery didn¡¯t sound right.

¡°When we looked up the address it comes up in the Bronx at an apartment building and it was supposed to be going to a business¡± Kirkou explained.

He said the man on the phone was calling from a Canadian area code.

The dispatcher followed orders and had a driver pick up the package from an address in Sunset Hills which was then to be delivered to FedEx. But the company¡¯s suspicion got them to alert police.

¡°I went home and it was bothering me,¡± Kirkou went on to say, ¡°and then I got a phone call from Sunset Hills Police Department asking if I could come up there and that the envelope was a scam.¡±

The envelope contained about $15,000 in cash belonging to a senior citizen couple.

The grandparents had fallen for what police commonly refer to as the ¡®Grandparent Scam.¡¯

¡°The victim received an urgent call from an individual purporting to be a public defender out of New York and gave them a long convoluted story about their grandson being involved in an accident,¡± explained Sergeant Robbie Hagen.

Hagen said the couple explained that they even talked with someone who sounded like their grandson claiming he needs a substantial amount of money.

It turned out that the couple has a grandson who lives in New York.

¡°People don¡¯t realize how much information is out there on the internet about all of us and what information these people are able to glean about our ages and who we are associated with and our family members,¡± said Hagen.

¡°You¡¯ve gotta watch out for your neighbors and your family,¡± said Kirkou, ¡°as a business, we have that moral obligation too and we are in the business to make money but that¡¯s not the way we want to earn it.¡±

Police said that these scams are becoming more and more common and can happen to anyone.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) ? The spam calls keep coming, but this one leaves a voicemail and it sounds like you should call them back.

The call, however, could cost you, CBS2¡¯s Clark Fouraker reported Thursday.

The call comes from a 10-digit number that looks domestic, but beware of area codes 809, which is in the Dominican Republic, 284, the British Virgin Islands, and 876, Jamaica.

¡°You¡¯re actually dialing internationally, and international rates apply. You can pay normal rates if you¡¯re calling a friend or family member, but there are also services called ¡®premium services,'¡± said John Breyault of the National Consumers League.

Those services could be lines dedicated to gambling or psychic readings. A new email warning says they leave a message that says, ¡°Hey this is Karen. Sorry I missed you. Get back to us quickly. I have something important to tell you.¡±

¡°It¡¯s very sad, and it¡¯s so many scams,¡± said Hope Chasin of the East Village.

¡°It¡¯s outrageous, of course, and AT&T or Verizon should block those calls and I¡¯m sure they¡¯re able to do it if they want,¡± Midtown resident David Pagar added.

The scams keep happening because the cost for scammers is so low. They can spam thousands of phones for next to nothing, and if just one person falls for the trick the scammers often walk away with a profit, Fouraker reported.

¡°Because of relationships they have with the phone company or the operator of that premium line get a kickback,¡± Breyault said.

That happens because the domestic and international phone company have paid each other for facilitating the international call. By the time you get your bill, you¡¯re the only one who hasn¡¯t paid.

¡°I tend to not call back any number that I don¡¯t know that haven¡¯t left a message just because of scammers,¡± Long Island resident William MacCloud said. ¡°People trying to charge me on my cellphone.¡±

The scammers bet on a small charge between $10-$30 not catching your attention. Experts say if you notice a charge on your bill to call your phone company and ask for the charge to be removed.

If the phone company won¡¯t drop the charge, experts say to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.

Most of the time when our phone rings we know who is on the other end. It may be a family member or possibly a friend and, if not either of those, likely some business or other contact we were expecting to hear from.

There are of course robocalls, which none of us like, but those are pretty easy to identify and hang up on. But what if you answered and the message was in Mandarin and it said to be from the Chinese consulate?

If you understand the language you might be a bit more inclined to pay attention, so when the voice says you need to take some steps in order to avoid any kind of trouble with the government, you might listen.

Unfortunately, it's all a scam

Like many attacks of this nature, they prey on people being confused or scared. Specifically, this scam tends to involve the call saying the consulate has an important document that needs to be retrieved, though it could also ask the person to provide information in order to avoid any kind of issue with the consulate.

Whatever the case, before the victim realizes what's going on, they have often wired a good amount of money to a Chinese bank.

A spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission told NBC News that there is no way to estimate this scam's scope, but reports have come in from all over the country. That led the Chinese embassy in the United States to provide an alert on its official website trying to help warn people about the scam, which it released back in April.

In part, it said:

"We would like to restate that the Embassy and Consulates General of China would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Embassy would not ask for bank account information."

Why is this one so effective?

Of course this scam, like most of its kind, takes advantage of people. But part of why it works is that the scammers use spoofing in order to make it appear as though their call is coming from a legitimate number, such as the Chinese consulate.

Add the fact that the call and message are in the Chinese language, and it's understandable why some would believe it to be legitimate.

One woman, who NBC News mentioned, ended up providing personal information including a name, address, age and Social Security number. With those details in hand, the scammers created what looked like a real arrest warrant, and they told the woman they would arrest her and remove her from the United States if she did not wire the money.

Only after sending the money did she look online and find out that the alleged arrest warrant was actually a document used in other scam attempts. She attempted to contact police in Hong Kong, which is where the money went, but they were unable to help.

However, through a little bit of luck, the transfer was frozen before it was submitted through the destination bank. She was able to recover the $95,000 she would have lost, save for the $80 wire fee.

Not everyone is as fortunate, so here's how to not become a victim

This specific scam targets people in the Chinese community, and in fact, the AARP reported in January that a great majority of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders age 50 and older said their families had been targets of fraud. Along those lines, one-third of all victims lost an average of $15,000.

But while this scam targets a certain community, in truth the methods to avoid it and others are very similar. It is important to understand that legitimate organizations, and especially governments, do not ask for sensitive information over the phone, nor would they require you wire money in order to settle an issue.

If you do receive one of the calls, it is a good idea to take a moment and do some research into it. If it is fake, chances are it will not take long to discover.

What to do if you've been scammed

When you realize you've been scammed out of money, there's no time to waste.

Contact the bank you used and see if it can stop the transaction. If you've purchased gift cards -- another favorite of scammers -- contact the company that issues the cards to see what they can do. You should also contact law enforcement -- local police or even the FBI -- if only to file a report that you might need later to make a claim.

More ways to stop phone call scams in their tracks

Ask your phone service provider if it offers a robocall blocking service. If not, encourage your provider to offer one. You can also visit the FCC's website for information and resources on available robocall blocking tools to help reduce unwanted calls. (Click here to learn how to block specific phone numbers.)

Many phone companies allow you to block calls that don't show a number on caller ID. Check with your provider to find out how to turn this feature on. Note: If someone you actually know calls you and blocks their outgoing number, their call won't make it through if you've turned this feature on.

This is actually the easiest solution to eliminating robocalls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them.

4. Subscribe to the Do Not Call Registry

This move will stop many robocalls before they begin. If you're on the registry, it's illegal for many robocallers to call you. Tap or click here to get your number into the National Do Not Call Registry. After your number is on the registry for 31 days, you can report unwanted sales calls.

If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you will receive more calls in the future.

You can also download and install call blocking apps such as NomoRobo, True Caller or Hiya on your smartphone. Tap or click here for more information about these types of apps.

New Zealanders are still being targeted by mysterious calls from international numbers as part of an elaborate scam that has been running over the last few years.

Dubbed the "Wangiri" scam, which translates from the Japanese to "one ring and cut", it involves con artists leaving missed calls on the user's phone from an unknown international number. Should the user call back, they are charged premium rates of up to $50 a minute.

This is not the first time such scam hit New Zealanders. As recently as February last year, there were reports of similar scams.

"The Wangiri call is when a scammer will call from a premium number and purposely hang up after one or two rings," she told the Herald.

"Because calls are billed typically from the time of answer, these attempts have no cost to the attacker. They will typically target mobile phones, as there is a higher likelihood that a mobile phone has caller ID display.

''The goal for the attacker is to entice victims to call back the number upon seeing a missed call. The perpetrators make money by collecting revenue on these calls via the premium rates issued by the overseas telecommunications provider, or by scamming victims on the return calls."

Arauzo draws a distinction between wangiri ruse and the increasingly common robo dialler scams, which are also present in New Zealand.

"The auto-dialler system enables the caller to systematically auto dial a list of numbers. If it picks up human activity on the other end it can either connect you to a person, or if there isn't someone available, it will be silent and then hang up."

While Arauzo said Spark customers "don't appear to be reporting a surge of this type of scam activity," she did say the telco is always vigilant in keeping an eye on these issues.

"Spark plays an active role in limiting the number of scam calls out there. When a scammer uses one number continuously, we identify and block that number."

The same also applies Vodafone, whose spokesperson Elissa Downey says they're also keeping an eye on scam activity.

"Unfortunately the 'wangiri' scam hits our shores from time to time, but we are not seeing a surge in this type of scam at the moment," said Downey.

"Our best advice is to avoid answering those numbers or any number you don't recognise or expect a call from and let the call go to voicemail. That way you can check if the message is from someone you were expecting or actually want to hear from. If the caller does not leave a message, ignore it and don't call the number back."

Beyond the missed call variation of the "wangiri" scam, Downey also recommends keeping an eye out for other scams.

"Another one to watch out for is an unsolicited call and someone starts engaging with you," Downey told the Herald.

"Typically, with this type of scam they are calling from overseas but sometimes they might spoof a New Zealand number, fixed or mobile, and they either try to sell you something or ask you for money."

Downey recommends users treat the interactions exactly the same as they would an unsolicited email.

"Simply hang up and don't engage," she said.

"It is really important to always be on your guard with callers you don't know ? if something seems a bit off or too good to be true, it usually is."

She also advises mobile users to notify their telco immediately if they have received a strange call or large charge.

"We work with the wider telco industry to block certain numbers from connecting through to customers phones if we know they are linked to a scam."

Downey finally recommends that users check the Consumer Protection website if they're in any doubt about whether something might be a scam.

Here's how to (try to) block them so they stop interrupting your grind.

You¡¯re not just imagining it: You're getting more robocalls.

Next year, almost half of all calls to cell phones will not be business calls or check-ins from loved ones, but scam calls. That grim forecast is according to First Orion, a company that makes caller ID and call-blocking software.

In 2017, First Orion estimated that about 3.7 percent of all calls to mobile numbers were spam. Today, they make up about 29 percent, but by early 2019, the company projects that proportion will skyrocket to 45 percent.

Some of the numbers for those incoming calls probably look eerily like your own phone number. (For me, the first six digits are often the same as mine.) That¡¯s to trick you into thinking the call might be coming from someone who lives near you, whom you might know. If you¡¯re like me, you¡¯ve wisened up to this trick, dubbed ¡°neighborhood spoofing,¡± and decline each call.

But for those who are fooled and answer, only to realize it¡¯s the same pesky automated call from the same familiar-looking number again, there are tools out there to block these spammy scams, one number at a time.

The deluge of unwanted calls disrupts our busy days. As a reporter, I¡¯ve more than once had my audio recording of an in-progress interview paused by an incoming call. Worse, they target individuals based on demographics, with attempts to convince immigrants they¡¯re in legal trouble or fraudulently persuade people to wire them money, posing as utility companies, charities and more.

More than half of all complaints the U.S. Federal Communications Commission receives pertain to unwanted calls, The Washington Post reports.

There are several ways to combat this onslaught, but be aware that the perpetrators of scams are savvy, and have found workarounds to number blocking and other measures individuals can take. For one, they don¡¯t honor the ¡°Do Not Call¡± list many households are on to thwart telemarketers. First Orion is in the process of developing new ¡°CallPrinting¡± technology, which it plans to implement through a major U.S. mobile carrier. Already, T-Mobile provides its subscribers with ¡°Scam Likely¡± caller ID messages.

As Entrepreneur described in a piece on banishing distractions earlier this year, an iPhone user can tap the blue circled ¡°i¡± symbol next to the number in their recent calls list and select ¡°Block this Caller.¡± Android users can hold down the number in their recent calls list, then select block. That is, until the next scam call comes in from a different number.

Scammers are flooding the United States with Chinese-language robocalls, causing major headaches from coast to coast.

These new robocalls are a lot like the ones you¡¯ve already gotten on your phone at all hours of the day and night: Your phone rings, you pick up, and after a brief pause or maybe a quiet click or beep, a prerecorded voice message meets your ears. The recording, which often sounds like a young woman, usually delivers a message about lowering credit-card rates or buying into cheap health insurance.

If you fall for the bait, you¡¯re transferred to a live human who will try anything to get you to hand over your credit-card or bank account info.

The important thing to remember is that sales robocalls are illegal in the United States. So, don¡¯t expect the person on the other end of the line to follow through on whatever deal they claim to offer. You¡¯re much more likely to fall victim to an identity theft scam or credit-card fraud than to score a deal from one of these spam callers.

The new Chinese-language version of these calls targets immigrants. The robocalls deliver a recorded message claiming to be from the Chinese consulate, saying the recipient is in trouble with Chinese officials, or sometimes that a package is waiting at the Chinese consulate that needs to be picked up.

Then, the robocall asks for a deposit or fee, demanding a credit-card number or bank information. Sometimes the robocall or live operator who follows it makes a threat, suggesting that more trouble will come if the person doesn¡¯t willingly hand over their financial info, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

In New York City alone, police estimate at least 30 residents had been scammed out of $3 million, according to National Public Radio.

The Chinese Consulate General in New York says it has posted dozens of alerts on its website warning about the scams. "We would like to restate that the Consulate General in New York would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Consulate General would not ask for bank account information," it warned.

The scammers are also upping the ante with a tech trick called ¡°spoofing.¡± Spoofed calls can fake caller ID numbers, making them look like they¡¯re coming from a familiar number, nearby area code, your hometown or in this case, the Chinese consulate, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which also issued an alert.

So, even if you don't speak Chinese, why would you get so many calls? The scammers don¡¯t know who they¡¯re calling, and it costs virtually nothing to place a phone call, so if they hit a few thousand English-speaking phones for every one Chinese speaker that¡¯s totally fine with them.

This scam uses many of the same ploys used on unsuspecting English speakers, say in the scam where the caller pretends to be from the IRS and is demanding payments on back taxes that don¡¯t really exist.

What to do:
?Never give money to any caller demanding it: If you speak Chinese and receive one of these threatening calls, never hand over your bank or credit card information, no matter how scary the recorded message might sound. Nobody ? including the Chinese consulate, the IRS and immigration officials ? will ever call you out of the blue to demand money, and they certainly won¡¯t pepper your phone with robocalls.
?Block numbers that hit you with repeated robocalls: If one specific number has been giving you a headache, you can block the number manually from your iPhone or Android smartphone. On the iPhone, click the little ¡°i¡± next to the number on your recent calls list and then tap ¡°Block This Caller.¡± On Android 6.0 or later you can find the number on your call history, tap it, then tap ¡°Block.¡±
?Use an app: Apps such as Nomorobo, Robokiller and YouMail, to name just a few, really can help curb robocalls. I use them, and they¡¯ve successfully thwarted thousands of spam calls to my cellphone. Many of the apps are free for at least a week, then cost around $2 a month or nearly $20 a year after that. (The apps present this to you as ¡°upgrades¡± or ¡°premium.¡±)
?Sign up for the federal Do Not Call list: The Do Not Call list is still your best bet for avoiding robocalls of all kinds, and that includes this new Chinese variant. I spoke with the FTC about the Do Not Call list and the many conspiracy theories that signing up for the list puts you at a greater risk of phone spam.

According to the FTC, getting access to the Do Not Call list not only requires valid sign-up information (you can¡¯t just request access to it anonymously) as well as an access fee. These are factors that push away scammers, and the FTC says it has never had to bring a robocall case against any company or group which has access to that list.

You might feel like robocalls are a never-ending disease, but the FTC already has had some huge wins in stemming the rising tide. The commission regularly hosts expos and forums to find new ways to stop the pesky calls and wages pricey lawsuits against telemarketers it catches using them. As recently as June the FTC nailed robocall operations that it says had made billions of robocalls.

Public warned not to answer phone calls from 'Wangiri' scam

Irish people have been targeted by a phone scam this week as fraudsters attempt to extract money from unsuspecting members of the public.

The scam - known as 'Wangiri fraud' - involves an unknown number calling your phone and leaving you with a missed call. When people call the number back, their phone credit is drained or a hefty charge is added to their phone bill.

Scams like this do the rounds every so often but the public are being warned not to be caught out by this latest one.

The calls are reported to be from Somalia and have a 00252 prefix.

The following advice should always be followed:
? Avoid answering calls from numbers that you cannot identify, especially if you are not expecting a call.
? Hang up immediately, on calls where there appears to be no recipient on the other end.
? Be wary of multiple calls being received from the same number.
? Do not call back any number that leaves you a blank voicemail message.
? Do not provide any personal information for example ? banking details/PPS number/credit card details/name and address/passport number etc.

Local law enforcement say someone is calling Texomans, claiming to be with the IRS demanding you pay up or face arrest from local officers.

Sherman police say they have received over 20 calls with questions about these scams in just the last two days, but that thankfully no one has fallen victim so far.

Paris Police have reported the same scam in their area this week.

The caller says local police will come to arrest you if you don't pay up immediately.

Police say if you get one of these calls, just hang up. The real IRS won't call you about a warrant.

If you've been contacted and wish to report this scam to the Federal Trade Commission, you can do so here.

If you¡¯ve received a phone call from someone claiming to be with EPCOR, asking for immediate cash payments, the power company is warning customers to be cautious.

The company has recently received complaints from customers about suspicious phone calls, in which the caller on the other end claims to be from EPCOR. The caller claims the account holder is in arrears and asks that cash payments be made immediately or power will be cut off.

¡°They target small businesses, they say if they don¡¯t make a payment ? cash, credit card or bitcoin very quickly, sometimes within the hour ? their power will be cut off,¡± EPCOR spokesperson Tim LeRiche said.

The company stressed that it does not take sudden action like this on billing arrears.

LeRiche said they had received more than 100 complaints about the scam over the last two days and said some people did make a payment to the people on the phone. However, he said they¡¯re seeing fewer people fall for these types of scams.

¡°Most people now are starting to get familiar with this thing and are suspicious and are calling in or posting to social media and we appreciate that as well.¡±

Anyone with questions about their account is asked to contact EPCOR at 780-310-4300. People can report suspicious activity to the Edmonton Police Service at 780-423-4567.

¡°If anybody gets a phone call of this type where they¡¯re being asked about their power bill they shouldn¡¯t be giving any information over the phone and if it does seem suspicious in any way at all they should call us to check.¡±

DARE COUNTY, N.C. ? If you¡¯ve received threatening calls claiming you owe money and asking for payment over the phone, you aren¡¯t the only one.

The Dare County Sheriff¡¯s Office has received several reports of citizens receiving scam phone calls.

Often the caller claims people owe money ? they may say that you have outstanding warrants, or claim that the IRS requires your social security number and money from you. Sometimes they ask you to pay via credit card or prepaid card and send the money electronically.

The Sheriff¡¯s Office has some tips when it comes to scam calls:
? The police will never ask for payment over the phone.
? Do not believe your caller I.D. Scammers can fake caller I.D. numbers using a process called ¡°spoofing.¡±
? Spot impostors that claim to be from a government entity or charitable organization. Do not give out personal information and do not pay with a credit card over the phone.
? Do not make wire or electronic money transfers to an unknown person.

Chinese Robocalls Bombarding The U.S. Are Part Of An International Phone Scam

If you live in a part of the country that has a large Chinese immigrant population, you may have recently received a robocall in Mandarin ? or even several of them. The calls seem to be blanketing certain phone exchanges without regard to the national origin of the recipients. Presumably, this is how the New York Police Department ended up on the call list.

NYPD Officer Donald McCaffrey, who works in the Queens grand larceny division, is investigating the calls in New York City. He has also been receiving them on a daily basis.

"I get them also, in the NYPD building," McCaffrey says. "I have an NYPD department cellphone and I get them on the cellphones, also. It is out of control."

Non-Mandarin speakers may find the robocalls baffling ? or annoying ? and just hang up. But some Chinese immigrants who have followed the robocall's prompts have found themselves sucked into an international phone scam.

The calls first came to McCaffrey's attention in December 2017, when a 65-year-old Chinese woman complained to the NYPD that she had been scammed out of $1.3 million.

"She called to report that someone from the Chinese Consulate called and said she needs to call the Beijing Police Department because she's being investigated for financial crimes over in China," McCaffrey says.

The robocall messages are usually some variation on that theme: This is the consulate; we have an important document that needs to be picked up; it may affect your status in the U.S.; press a button to speak with a specialist ? and that is when a connection is made to a live scammer.

That person then tries to execute what is known as a "parcel scam" ? pretending to be from a courier company and claiming that a package addressed to the victim is connected to a criminal case. The phone call is then transferred to a fake police officer who says that it's a money laundering investigation and that if the victim transfers money to a Hong Kong bank account, the police will resolve the case.

So far, the NYPD has received 30 complaints from people who have lost money to this robocall scam. McCaffrey estimates $3 million has been stolen from the city's residents. The NYPD and security experts who have looked into these calls say they think the calls are originating in mainland China.

The Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in New York says it has been been getting about 100 calls a week from people complaining about the scam and has posted a warning on its website. The consulate became aware of the phone scam last August.

"It's still a severe situation," says Ma Chao, a consulate official.

Ma says he has reported the calls to the Chinese police but was told it would be very difficult to track down the scammers. "These calls could easily be made from anywhere in the world, from Europe or Africa or Asia," he says. He adds that he has heard about similar scams that originate in Taiwan and parts of Southeast Asia.

In the U.S., the scam isn't limited to New York. Similar calls, in Mandarin, have been reported in cities such as Boston and Houston. The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Los Angeles and the embassy in Washington, D.C., have issued warnings about the scam. The Federal Trade Commission, which helps consumers and law enforcement collect information on illegal phone calls, has posted its own warnings.

The calls have also surfaced in Australia and Canada. At a news conference last year, Staff Sgt. Annie Linteau of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the calls reported to the RCMP accused the recipient of a financial crime, just like the calls the NYPD is investigating, but then, the victims are "instructed to isolate themselves, and their family in China are made to believe their loved ones in Canada are abducted." The RCMP calls this scheme "virtual kidnapping."

"You wouldn't expect it, but people do fall for that sort of thing," says Ben Yates, a lawyer based in Hong Kong specializing in cybersecurity and cryptocurrencies at the international law firm RPC.

Yates suspects Chinese living overseas, even law-abiding citizens, are vulnerable because they have legitimate worries about the government monitoring their activities.

"If you're based overseas and you're from mainland China, then you may be concerned about the authorities questioning what you're doing," he says. "Whether it involves transferring money out of China or other aspects of your activities, it could be all kinds of things the authorities could have an interest in.

"You have to understand the sort of regime they're used to dealing with and the sort of political and legal system that operates in mainland China that might be quite different to what you're used to in the U.S."

To add to the confusion, the calls look legitimate because scammers are able to make the caller ID display the number for an actual Chinese Consulate. This is known as "spoofing" and is a common, illegal tactic to get people to answer robocalls, which are illegal in the U.S. unless you have asked to be put on a call list.

Lawyer Yates says that although the scammers are very likely operating out of mainland China, the money is often sent to a Hong Kong bank where it's easier to open an account and raises less suspicion from authorities because of the high volume of international transactions there.

A lack of Mandarin-language skills may protect some people from this robocall scam, but it's not the only one out there. Robocalls are the top complaint at the Federal Communications Commission, with more than 4.5 million in 2017, up from 3.4 million in 2016.

One way to cut down on unwanted calls is to put your phone number on the National Do Not Call Registry.

But the best way to avoid being scammed? When the voice on the other end is a recording, just hang up.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - A pervasive new phone scam aims to steal your identity by obtaining your social security number in order to be compromised.

"It was really legit, it sounded really legit," said Roberto Ortega, who received a call earlier this week.

Scammers are impersonating "agents" with the Social Security Administration.

"They said my social had been suspended for illegal activity and they needed to confirm my identity," Ortega said.

The scammer will then ask to confirm the social security number or threaten that your assets will be frozen. That's the scam, but the catch is the caller may know more about you than you might think.

"He tells me my name, he tells me my phone number, he tells me my date of birth, even my address," said Ortega. "It made it really believable."

According to security experts, some victims are more susceptible than others. For example, if you've ever received a strange text asking to click on a random link; more often than not, that exposes personal information on your device. This then makes certain victim's information more likely to be a target.

The text may also be referred to as a malicious link that aims to gain control of devices or access information.

"You can never be too safe or too secure with your personal information," said Det. Jon Price, with the El Paso County Sheriff's Office.

Price explains victims are just as susceptible to fraud on social media sites, like Facebook. It's a simple search on sites like "Pipl" that allow anyone to dig up specific details about people's lives.

Bottom line, tighten your privacy settings and block spam calls from your phone.

To do this for Facebook, go to your settings page and make sure "friends only" is selected in every box to keep limited access to your profile.

ST. CLOUD -- The Stearns County Sheriff's office is warning you about a recent phone scam that's circulating around the St. Cloud metro area.

Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson says scammers are calling people and telling them they have pending criminal charges against them. The scammer then directs the person to contact the IRS at a provided number or be subject to arrest.

Authorities say these calls are not authentic and are only being used as a way for the scammer to get money out of you. The IRS doesn't contact people this way.

Gudmundson says if you do receive a call like this, hang up. In some cases, people have received multiple calls. However, it's not necessary to call authorities at this point since they have several reports already filed.

When people talk about phone scams, it's often the variety of fraud that can occur through cold calls to a person's home or mobile device. Like when scammers leave vaguely official sounding voicemails claiming to be Internal Revenue Service agents who need all of your personal information (and probably some form of payment) to close a faux tax audit. Or when some joker calls with the breathless information that you've "won" a free vacation. All you have to do is fork over a couple hundred bucks in "prize tax" to claim a trip that doesn't exist.

But as technology advances, scammers are getting more sophisticated. They're increasingly using fraud to take control of people's phones, often without the device ever leaving a victim's pocket.

"It's almost the same as having the device physically stolen," says Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center. "They could have access to the data for any accounts that you use your phone to access."

It's called "porting out": Thieves use a person's information to switch his or her phone number to a new phone with a new service provider. They can then use the phone to intercept messages. That includes two-factor authentication messages, the codes that banks and others often send their customers to confirm their identity before customers can access their accounts online.

"Essentially, they're getting their hands on your ID credentials somehow," Velasquez says. "Then they're contacting your mobile carrier and transferring those credentials to a new device."

The scam isn't new, but fraudsters are having enough success with it to get mobile phone service providers' attention. T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon have all warned customers in recent months of the threat of porting out schemes. The four major U.S. carriers also have created a task force to come up with ways to better authenticate that folks who ask to move their numbers from one service or phone to another are actually the numbers' owners.

Here's one sure sign that you may be the victim of porting out fraud: Your phone goes dark unexpectedly.

There are plenty of reasons why a phone may shut down, from a shoddy battery, extreme heat, water damage or missed payments. But when a fraudster switches your number to another device, that will also do the trick.

The scam normally starts with a thief getting hold of enough of your personal information to pose as you when asking your phone carrier to port out your number. Info like Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses are often obtained through basic internet and social media searches or through web-based black markets.

If you think you've been victimized by porting out, there are a few things you should do after contacting your phone service provider. Check your bank, credit card and other accounts to make sure you can still log in to them online and that there's been no suspicious activity like unauthorized purchases or information changes. It's also worth considering freezing your credit to stop anyone from opening new accounts in your name. You can also create a fraud alert through credit reporting bureaus as an additional protection. While you're doing that, be sure to snag a free credit report to check for suspicious activity.

Velasquez says there are plenty of things people can do to avoid being ported out in the first place. That starts with changing the way you think about your device.

"We often don't treat a mobile device like the computer that it is," Velasquez says. "You need to think about your device the same way you think about your laptop."

That means getting antivirus and malware protection. It also means using the tools that many cell phone service providers already offer, like port validation protection. Port validation requires device users to create a separate password, which he or she has to enter before the service provider will approve a request to move the number to another phone or account. Some service providers ? like Verizon and Sprint ? require customers to select a port out validation pin when they sign up for service.

Of course, fraudsters could still find a way to manipulate or get their hands on port validation pins. But the move provides an extra layer of protection that thieves have to get through in order to take your phone.

You might think only the naive and gullible fall victim to online scams, but scammers actually target everyone. Here's how to avoid falling into their traps.

GETTING incessant phone calls from a foreign land? Even if you¡¯re a worldly character, think twice before picking up.

If it¡¯s an unknown number with an unusual country code, you probably shouldn¡¯t answer and certainly don¡¯t call back because it will end up costing you. It¡¯s likely that such calls are something known as a ¡°wangiri scam¡± after a Japanese word which loosely translates to ¡°one ring and cut¡±.

The phone calls essentially prank your phone in the hopes you will call back at which point you might be unwittingly racking up a hefty bill.

This type of scam has become increasingly common with calls originating from places like Cuba, Africa and Latvia targeting mobile customers in Australia in recent months.

This past weekend, I received one from Morocco and Latvia.

Fellow news.com.au tech writer Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson was bombarded with calls from Latvia over the weekend.

¡°Argh! Getting phone calls from Latvia on the hour, every hour tonight,¡± she wrote on Twitter.

Other Australians have been reporting the same thing. Some appeared quite perplexed by the onslaught of foreign prank calls.

Speaking to the ABC earlier this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission¡¯s deputy chair, Delia Rickard, recommended ignoring calls from country codes you don¡¯t recognise.

¡°What typically happens is the scammer calls for just one ring then cuts the line leaving a missed call on the victim¡¯s phone,¡± she said.

¡°Then the victim calls the number back and they could be put on hold, have music playing or they could try and chat.¡±

The objective is to keep you on the phone for as long as possible. The scammers often call on premium lines similar to those used by psychic hotlines or sex lines that can end up costing you a small fortune.

But Wangiri calls are different and Ms Rickard said with scams like these, the perpetrators can find a way to get some of the money charged for calling the premium line ? and it¡¯s very difficult for telcos to prevent.

According to the ACCC¡¯s ScamWatch, Australians have lost more than $48,000 to premium service scam calls in the past year.

So if you see someone calling from Latvia, proceed with caution.

A few days ago, I got a call from a number I didn¡¯t recognize. A string of calls, actually, in a span of about three minutes.

I ignored them at first, like I do with every unknown number that flashes on my cell phone screen (don¡¯t we all?). But after five back-to-back missed calls, there was a growing sense of urgency. So I typed the number into Google, and realized, with horror, that it belonged to a local police station.

I called back, and got the switchboard for Manhattan¡¯s 24th Precinct. Who needs bail money? I wondered. Did that creepy OKCupid date finally murder somebody? Am I being asked to testify?

As I listened to an automated voice rattle off a list of extensions, my phone buzzed again ? another call from the precinct. This time, I answered.

¡°Hi is this Miss Kristen Bahler? This is very urgent. Do you know that you¡¯re the subject of an FBI investigation?¡±

¡°Do you know you¡¯re under investigation? Have you been briefed on your file?¡±

¡°This is very serious. If you don¡¯t comply, someone will come and arrest you.¡±

After a few minutes of escalating frustration on both ends, and several failed attempts to press the guy for more information, it finally clicked. This wasn¡¯t a federal agent. This was a scammer.

Eventually, he hung up on me, and I was left with some burning questions. Who was this criminal mastermind, and how did he get my number? What, exactly, was his end game? Did he want my money? My social security number? Do other people get these calls? Do they fall for them? Why did the call come from an ACTUAL POLICE STATION????

The real New York Police Department didn¡¯t have any answers. I called the switchboard again, and tried a few of the extensions. Eventually I got through to an investigator, who told me he didn¡¯t have a clue what I was talking about.

¡°They called you from this number?¡± he asked. ¡°And said you¡¯re under investigation? Are you?¡±

Next, I tried Paige Hanson, identity education lead at the cybersecurity firm Symantec (which makes Norton antivirus software). She was less confused.

¡°This is a common scam,¡± she says. ¡°It happens to a lot of people.¡±

It even has a name: ¡°Spoofing,¡± a range of techniques criminals use to pretend to be someone they¡¯re not with the help of fake IP addresses, emails, or, in my case, phone numbers. What they wanted was for me to handover my credit card number, in a panic, which they could have charged for any number of purchases, or my social security number, making me one of the more than 15 million Americans who fall prey to identify fraud every year.

It¡¯s actually pretty easy to hijack a phone number, Hanson says. Thanks to apps like ¡°SpoofCard,¡± anyone with internet access can disguise their personal number with a new one of their choosing ? even if it already belongs to a law enforcement agency, a hospital, or an Outback Steakhouse.

These apps market their services as a way for debt collectors, private investigators, and other professionals to mask their identity, and as an all-in-good fun conduit to prank calls. But Hanson says they¡¯ve also empowered fraudsters to scare people into answering bogus calls.

¡°The urge to answer becomes harder to resist,¡± she says. And when you do pick up the phone, you get ¡°a fear-based message that sends you into the red zone.¡±

There¡¯s not a lot of data on how widespread ¡°spoofing¡± actually is, but fraudulent calls are certainly a problem regulators are grappling with. According to the FTC, the state of New York alone logged more than 16,000 complaints of ¡°imposter¡± calls last year. Nationally, that number¡¯s close to 300,000. And since a lot of people who get these calls don¡¯t actually report them, those figures are probably just scratching the surface.

How do you suss out a real FBI or police call from a fake one? In a press release about the scam, the FBI warns consumers that ¡°The FBI does not call private citizens threatening arrest or requesting money.¡± Chances are, if you¡¯re under investigation by the FBI, you won¡¯t learn about it in a phone call.

If you¡¯re not yet deeply unsettled, here¡¯s a bit of info that should do the trick: Services like SpoofCard can completely mask a phone number, so the one users choose to replace it with (the NYPD¡¯s, in my case) is the number that shows up on both your phone bill, and your caller ID.

Gullible consumers aren¡¯t the only ones at risk. A fraudulent phone bill makes it hard for other vulnerable groups, like victims of stalking, to get the proof they need to seek legal protections from an abuser. SpoofCard, for what it¡¯s worth, seems fine with this: A recent blog post on the company¡¯s website gives step-by-step instructions for contacting an ex who¡¯s blocked you from their phone.

Hanson couldn¡¯t say for sure where the scammer got my number from, but says giant data breaches like the 2013 Target breach that resulted in a treasure trove of stolen phone numbers, emails, and credit card information ? have made it pretty easy for criminals to get that information too.

As a precaution, she recommended adding my number to the National Do Not Call Registry, a federal department that blocks businesses from slamming consumers with unsolicited calls. Ideally, the registry will cut the volume of calls I receive, and will make me think twice before answering one that does make it through (its likely to be a scam). There are also a number of call-blocking apps that can help manage incoming calls, Hanson points out.

¡°It¡¯s really just a matter of upping your game,¡± Hanson says. ¡°Now, you have to be vigilant about where you¡¯re giving your information, what you¡¯re providing, and what phone calls you¡¯re answering.¡±

Expert-approved advice to never answer the phone again? Now that¡¯s a silver lining.

Close to half of all calls to mobile phones will be fraudulent in 2019 unless measures are taken to mitigate the surge, according to a new report.

The report from First Orion, which provides call management and protection services for major carriers like T-Mobile, states there has been an alarming spike in fraudulent calls over the past year, zooming from 3.7 percent of total calls in 2017 to 29.2 percent in 2018. That is expected to jumping to 44.6 percent by early 2019.

Over 50 billion calls made to cell phone customers over the past 18 months were analyzed for the report.

FACEBOOK ACCUSED OF CENSORSHIP BY LIBERAL SITE AFTER WEEKLY STANDARD FACT CHECKS ARTICLE

Call spoofing ? where the originating call is ¡°spoofed¡± or disguised ? is getting increasingly annoying and sophisticated. For example, "neighborhood¡± or ¡°community¡± spoofing disguises the fraudulent call by matching the area code and the three-digit prefix to your phone number. This increases the likelihood that you will answer the call.

¡°Third-party call blocking apps are largely ineffective when it comes to detecting spoof calls since they can only black-list against known scam numbers, not legitimate numbers that are momentarily hijacked by scammers,¡± First Orion said in a statement.

Cell phone users without adequate call blocking or call screening can be swamped everyday by fraudulent calls.

Carriers are trying to fight this. Verizon, for example, offers a spam filter app that can block calls based on the risk level set by the user.

Unfortunately, scammers are constantly changing tactics so it¡¯s a ¡°whack a mole¡± game trying to prevent the calls, a Verizon spokesperson told Fox News. ¡°It¡¯s a complicated problem with no simple solutions,¡± the spokesperson added.

And the problem is also a legal one. ¡°Currently it's not illegal to spoof another person's phone number,¡± Verizon told Fox News in an email. ¡°We support federal legislation that would go after the spammers that are making these calls.¡±

The FCC is working to boost measures to fight phone fraud via SHAKEN/STIR, a standard for the cryptographic signing of telephone calls. The goal is to eradicate spoofed numbers from the telephone system.

US IS THE WORLD'S HOTSPOT FOR MALICIOUS WEBSITES



¡°A critical element of solving this problem is call authentication?essentially creating a ¡®digital fingerprint¡¯ for each phone call that scammers can¡¯t spoof or misuse,¡± FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in May.

For consumers, this means the number displayed on the Caller ID would be the number that the call actually originated from. This capability could be operational sometime next year.



First Orion, for its part, is planning to introduce its CallPrinting technology to carriers to thwart fraudulent calls later this year.

Phone scammers purporting to be from a Chinese consulate office are tricking people in the U.S. into handing over huge sums of money.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the Chinese-language calls appear to be going to ¡°people with Chinese last names.¡± Those outside the apparent target group may be unaffected by the racket, but the FTC warned everyone to be vigilant as ¡°scammers¡¯ tactics can change quickly.¡±

The commission said that people across the U.S. have been reporting the calls, which appear to deploy a range of tactics in a bid to trick the recipient. Some begin with an instruction to pick up a package at a nearby Chinese consular office, while others ask for information ¡°to avoid being in trouble with the Chinese consulate,¡± the FTC said. The scammer could also trick the person into thinking they¡¯re in some kind of trouble and could face arrest if they travel to China. At some point, the caller will ask for personal details such as bank or credit card information, or for a bank transfer to be made.

And the ruse is clearly working. Since December, 21 members of New York City¡¯s Chinese community have lost a total of $2.5 million, according to the New York Police Department, with individuals reporting losses ranging from $1,800 to $1.4 million, according to Voices of NY. Some have lost their life savings.

The caller IDs appear to indicate that the calls are coming from a local number, but investigators say it¡¯s actually coming from a location in China.

 The FTC reminded people never to send money to anyone who asks you to do so over the phone.

¡°Never give your Social Security number, your bank or credit card number, or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it,¡± the commission said. ¡°Same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as WeChat: just don¡¯t respond. That¡¯s a scam. And neither the real Chinese consulates, nor the Chinese Embassy, will ever call you to ask for money.¡±

The FTC told recipients of such scam calls to act decisively: ¡°If you get a call or message like this, hang up or delete it, and then tell the FTC. If you have business with the real Chinese consulate and you¡¯re worried, contact the real Chinese Consulate by looking up your local office¡¯s number. But, whatever you do, don¡¯t give out your information ? or your money ? to anyone who contacts you out of the blue.¡±

More than 100 phone calls have flooded the Portage County Sheriff's Office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers. Victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested.

This is the latest scam hitting residents in Portage County where even the sheriff received one of those calls. "I actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up. I played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes I asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him? I said I am the local sheriff and he hung up," explained Sheriff Mike Lukas, Portage County Sheriff's Office.

The scammers use fake names and bogus IRS identification numbers and, in some cases, they may know a lot about who they are calling. Even the caller ID can appear to look like it is the IRS.

Jennifer Sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls. She got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year.

"Earlier this year I got a voicemail that I was going to be taken into custody and I thought 'oh my god what do I do?' but this one I was kind of taken like this isn't real. They were saying I was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name," said Sisley.

If you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information.

"Immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay. Those are definitely scams," said Sheriff Lukas.

"Just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it," said Sisley.

NBN robocall scam threatens to disconnect households from the internet

A phone scam claiming to be from the National Broadband Network (NBN) has ramped up in Queensland, with one woman harassed eight times in the past three days.

The ABC has been told the robocalls include an automated voice, warning the NBN would be turned off in the local area so maintenance work could be undertaken.

People are prompted to press "1" to discuss the matter further, or "2" to disconnect from the internet.

Beryce Nelson from Toogoolawah in the Brisbane Valley said the NBN was not available in her area, so she knew it was some kind of scam.

"I've had eight of them over the past three days, repeated calls ? robocalls ? from an organisation or group of people pretending to be NBN, and I would think that there would be something involving your bank account details if you did get into any discussion with them," she said.

"I was intimidated the second and third time and it's because I thought, 'Well maybe it is the NBN', and then I thought, 'No don't be silly ? we don't have the NBN'."

She said she hung up the phone and did not engage, but was worried not everyone would realise the calls were part of a scam.

"The electronic voice is very authoritative and scary," Ms Nelson said.

"I just want to let people know that if they get this call, it's not fair dinkum, because if you were in an NBN area, you might very well think it was real."

She said she had tried to contact NBN Co to let them know about the phone calls, but had not been able to get through.

"I did try but the wait time was very long and that's probably because there might be a lot of people getting this call who are trying to follow up, just being confused and a bit afraid," she said.

The ABC has been told similar scam NBN calls have been received in Victoria.

NBN Co told the ABC it was aware of scammers asking for personal information and financial details.

NBN Co chief security officer Darren Kane said people needed to protect their personal information by being on guard, verifying who they were talking to and never disclosing bank accounts or other personal details to an unsolicited caller.

"It is important to be aware that NBN Co will never make unsolicited calls or door knock to sell broadband services," he said.

"NBN Co may make calls to individuals registered on our Medical Alarm or Fire and Lift registers, but will never request payment or bank account details during these calls."

Mr Kane said any scams should be reported to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission through its Scamwatch website.

Just like well-known scams in which callers claim to be from the Internal Revenue Service, this phishing scam plays on fear in the Chinese community.

WASHINGTON ? A scam targeting the Chinese community in Montgomery County, Maryland, fleeced several people of over a million dollars.

Just like other well-known scams ? like the one in which a caller claims to be from the Internal Revenue Service, or another where the victim is threatened with a fine for missing jury duty ? this phishing scam plays on fear, said Brandon Mengedoht, a detective with Montgomery County police¡¯s financial crimes division.

¡°Out of the blue, the speaker on the other end will identify themselves as some type of law enforcement ? either the Chinese government [or] from Hong Kong, or Taiwan, in some cases,¡± said Mengedoht.

The caller will then demand the recipient pay a fine immediately over the phone, and often will call back and demand more money, or claim the payment did not go through.

Since May, just seven victims have lost a combined $1.4 million.

¡°We had one victim suffer over $700,000 alone,¡± he said.

Investigators believe the victims could be connected through a church, neighborhood or community listserv containing personal information which ultimately fell into the wrong hands. Mengedoht said the culprit could also be robocalls that cast a wide net, in hope of capturing at least a couple of big fish.

¡°This is an affinity-type fraud. They¡¯re targeting their own community. There could be victims out there who are embarrassed and don¡¯t want to come forward, but the information they have might lead to identifying who they are or prevent this from happening to the next victim.¡±

You might think only the naive and gullible fall victim to online scams, but scammers actually target everyone. Here's how to avoid falling into their traps.

GETTING incessant phone calls from a foreign land? Even if you¡¯re a worldly character, think twice before picking up.

If it¡¯s an unknown number with an unusual country code, you probably shouldn¡¯t answer and certainly don¡¯t call back because it will end up costing you. It¡¯s likely that such calls are something known as a ¡°wangiri scam¡± after a Japanese word which loosely translates to ¡°one ring and cut¡±.

The phone calls essentially prank your phone in the hopes you will call back at which point you might be unwittingly racking up a hefty bill.

This type of scam has become increasingly common with calls originating from places like Cuba, Africa and Latvia targeting mobile customers in Australia in recent months.

This past weekend, I received one from Morocco and Latvia.

Fellow news.com.au tech writer Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson was bombarded with calls from Latvia over the weekend.

¡°Argh! Getting phone calls from Latvia on the hour, every hour tonight,¡± she wrote on Twitter.

Other Australians have been reporting the same thing. Some appeared quite perplexed by the onslaught of foreign prank calls.

Speaking to the ABC earlier this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission¡¯s deputy chair, Delia Rickard, recommended ignoring calls from country codes you don¡¯t recognise.

¡°What typically happens is the scammer calls for just one ring then cuts the line leaving a missed call on the victim¡¯s phone,¡± she said.

¡°Then the victim calls the number back and they could be put on hold, have music playing or they could try and chat.¡±

The objective is to keep you on the phone for as long as possible. The scammers often call on premium lines similar to those used by psychic hotlines or sex lines that can end up costing you a small fortune.

But Wangiri calls are different and Ms Rickard said with scams like these, the perpetrators can find a way to get some of the money charged for calling the premium line ? and it¡¯s very difficult for telcos to prevent.

According to the ACCC¡¯s ScamWatch, Australians have lost more than $48,000 to premium service scam calls in the past year.

So if you see someone calling from Latvia, proceed with caution.

A few days ago, I got a call from a number I didn¡¯t recognize. A string of calls, actually, in a span of about three minutes.

I ignored them at first, like I do with every unknown number that flashes on my cell phone screen (don¡¯t we all?). But after five back-to-back missed calls, there was a growing sense of urgency. So I typed the number into Google, and realized, with horror, that it belonged to a local police station.

I called back, and got the switchboard for Manhattan¡¯s 24th Precinct. Who needs bail money? I wondered. Did that creepy OKCupid date finally murder somebody? Am I being asked to testify?

As I listened to an automated voice rattle off a list of extensions, my phone buzzed again ? another call from the precinct. This time, I answered.

¡°Hi is this Miss Kristen Bahler? This is very urgent. Do you know that you¡¯re the subject of an FBI investigation?¡±

¡°Do you know you¡¯re under investigation? Have you been briefed on your file?¡±

¡°This is very serious. If you don¡¯t comply, someone will come and arrest you.¡±

After a few minutes of escalating frustration on both ends, and several failed attempts to press the guy for more information, it finally clicked. This wasn¡¯t a federal agent. This was a scammer.

Eventually, he hung up on me, and I was left with some burning questions. Who was this criminal mastermind, and how did he get my number? What, exactly, was his end game? Did he want my money? My social security number? Do other people get these calls? Do they fall for them? Why did the call come from an ACTUAL POLICE STATION????

The real New York Police Department didn¡¯t have any answers. I called the switchboard again, and tried a few of the extensions. Eventually I got through to an investigator, who told me he didn¡¯t have a clue what I was talking about.

¡°They called you from this number?¡± he asked. ¡°And said you¡¯re under investigation? Are you?¡±

Next, I tried Paige Hanson, identity education lead at the cybersecurity firm Symantec (which makes Norton antivirus software). She was less confused.

¡°This is a common scam,¡± she says. ¡°It happens to a lot of people.¡±

It even has a name: ¡°Spoofing,¡± a range of techniques criminals use to pretend to be someone they¡¯re not with the help of fake IP addresses, emails, or, in my case, phone numbers. What they wanted was for me to handover my credit card number, in a panic, which they could have charged for any number of purchases, or my social security number, making me one of the more than 15 million Americans who fall prey to identify fraud every year.

It¡¯s actually pretty easy to hijack a phone number, Hanson says. Thanks to apps like ¡°SpoofCard,¡± anyone with internet access can disguise their personal number with a new one of their choosing ? even if it already belongs to a law enforcement agency, a hospital, or an Outback Steakhouse.

These apps market their services as a way for debt collectors, private investigators, and other professionals to mask their identity, and as an all-in-good fun conduit to prank calls. But Hanson says they¡¯ve also empowered fraudsters to scare people into answering bogus calls.

¡°The urge to answer becomes harder to resist,¡± she says. And when you do pick up the phone, you get ¡°a fear-based message that sends you into the red zone.¡±

There¡¯s not a lot of data on how widespread ¡°spoofing¡± actually is, but fraudulent calls are certainly a problem regulators are grappling with. According to the FTC, the state of New York alone logged more than 16,000 complaints of ¡°imposter¡± calls last year. Nationally, that number¡¯s close to 300,000. And since a lot of people who get these calls don¡¯t actually report them, those figures are probably just scratching the surface.

How do you suss out a real FBI or police call from a fake one? In a press release about the scam, the FBI warns consumers that ¡°The FBI does not call private citizens threatening arrest or requesting money.¡± Chances are, if you¡¯re under investigation by the FBI, you won¡¯t learn about it in a phone call.

If you¡¯re not yet deeply unsettled, here¡¯s a bit of info that should do the trick: Services like SpoofCard can completely mask a phone number, so the one users choose to replace it with (the NYPD¡¯s, in my case) is the number that shows up on both your phone bill, and your caller ID.

Gullible consumers aren¡¯t the only ones at risk. A fraudulent phone bill makes it hard for other vulnerable groups, like victims of stalking, to get the proof they need to seek legal protections from an abuser. SpoofCard, for what it¡¯s worth, seems fine with this: A recent blog post on the company¡¯s website gives step-by-step instructions for contacting an ex who¡¯s blocked you from their phone.

Hanson couldn¡¯t say for sure where the scammer got my number from, but says giant data breaches like the 2013 Target breach that resulted in a treasure trove of stolen phone numbers, emails, and credit card information ? have made it pretty easy for criminals to get that information too.

As a precaution, she recommended adding my number to the National Do Not Call Registry, a federal department that blocks businesses from slamming consumers with unsolicited calls. Ideally, the registry will cut the volume of calls I receive, and will make me think twice before answering one that does make it through (its likely to be a scam). There are also a number of call-blocking apps that can help manage incoming calls, Hanson points out.

¡°It¡¯s really just a matter of upping your game,¡± Hanson says. ¡°Now, you have to be vigilant about where you¡¯re giving your information, what you¡¯re providing, and what phone calls you¡¯re answering.¡±

Expert-approved advice to never answer the phone again? Now that¡¯s a silver lining.

Earlier this month, a Bargersville woman got a phone call from a number belonging to the Johnson County Sheriff's Office.

She answered, and the caller explained to her that she had a warrant out for her arrest for missing jury duty. To make it right and avoid arrest, she would have to pay a heavy fine.

The number was checked and appeared to be authentic, but the caller had no affiliation with sheriff's office. The person on the line was simply a scammer willing to say anything to fleece thousands of dollars from his target.

And experts warn that there are countless others looking to commit this kind of fraud searching for their next victim.

Keeping his word: 3 years later, IMPD officer who met a boy at his mom's murder scene is keeping a promise

"This kind of scam had often been perpetrated in the past by someone claiming to be form the IRS, saying that that somebody owes a penalty, it¡¯s overdue and they¡¯ll be arrested," said Eugene Spafford, a Purdue University professor of computer science who is a member of the National Cyber Security Hall of Fame. "Another thing that often shows up is someone who claims to be from a credit card company or a bank saying that you're really overdue or they suspect fraud, and they want people to respond with information that would then be used to commit fraud.

"The general problem is the same ¡¦ phone calls and emails aren't really verified and somebody who understands the technology can spoof those, just like if you were to get a letter in the mail. Anybody can type in a return address or even mock up a letterhead that doesn't necessarily match the person who is sending it."

According to a police report from the Johnson County Sheriff's Office, the suspect carried out his scheme on the 47-year-old Bargersville woman on Oct. 5.

The woman told police that she got a call at work from someone claiming to be law enforcement who explained that she would be arrested if she didn't immediately pay a fine.

The woman was directed to leave work and call a provided number, police said. When she did, the call got disrupted.

She quickly got a call back from a different number. She checked the number online, and saw that it was the non-emergency number for the Johnson County Sheriff's Office.

The call between her and a man who called himself "Roy" lasted nearly three hours, police said. Roy said to take care of the warrant, the woman had to go to a local Kroger and buy $5,500 in prepaid debit cards and provide the card numbers over the phone, which she did.

The woman told police that Roy may have also obtained her social security number and a photo of her driver's license during the interaction. He threatened that she would face more criminal charges if she told anyone about the call.

When the woman asked if she could just go to the sheriff's office to pay the fine, Roy told her she would be placed under arrest if she did that. The police reports states that Roy could also tell when the woman was driving and where she was.

The woman drove to the sheriff's office while still on the call with Roy, according to the police report. When the caller learned that she was going to police, he threatened to put her personal information on the dark web and child pornography websites.

As the woman went to end the call, Roy said that he was a hacker who had taken all of her money and that there was nothing she could do about it, according to the police report. At the sheriff's office, police explained the process of "call spoofing," which is when an individual places a call and makes it look like it is coming from a different number.

Spafford, who served as a cybersecurity adviser to three past U.S. presidents, said no matter if it's a phone call, an email or even an in-person solicitation, the best way to handle this kind of scam is the same.

"Get a name, and if possible a case number for whatever it is you're being called about. Whoever is calling should be willing to give you that," he said. "Hang up, find the real number, and call it back. Call them and explain that you want to talk to Deputy so-and-so or whoever contacted you and verify the details."

Spafford said when fraudsters are presented with such a request, they will usually decline. He added that they will pressure targets by saying that they are out of time, or that this is their last chance to avoid arrest.

"But if it's a real law enforcement agency, they will understand," he said.

Spafford said the mention of gift or prepaid cards is also an immediately red flag.

"No legitimate agency, be it at the federal, state or local level, will ask for gift cards. Ever," he said. "That is not a legitimate form of payment for debt, and as soon as people hear that, they should hang up, call the actual law enforcement agency and report the fraud."

These kinds of scams have been around for decades, Spafford explained, and new technology makes them even more common. There are a number of ways to spoof phone numbers, and even free apps that exist for regular citizens to hide or fake their numbers.

Other scams to be cautious of are people calling to report an issue with your computer or smartphone software, and people claiming to raise money for a recent disaster like Hurricane Michael.

"Basically these people are taking advantage of the available technology," Spafford said. "The FCC does not require that the phone system present phone numbers accurately, and the (email) system does not require that you specify the correct email. As a result, people that don't understand that can be easily taken advantage of."

Close to half of all calls to mobile phones will be fraudulent in 2019 unless measures are taken to mitigate the surge, according to a new report.

The report from First Orion, which provides call management and protection services for major carriers like T-Mobile, states there has been an alarming spike in fraudulent calls over the past year, zooming from 3.7 percent of total calls in 2017 to 29.2 percent in 2018. That is expected to jumping to 44.6 percent by early 2019.

Over 50 billion calls made to cell phone customers over the past 18 months were analyzed for the report.

Call spoofing ? where the originating call is ¡°spoofed¡± or disguised ? is getting increasingly annoying and sophisticated. For example, "neighborhood¡± or ¡°community¡± spoofing disguises the fraudulent call by matching the area code and the three-digit prefix to your phone number. This increases the likelihood that you will answer the call.

¡°Third-party call blocking apps are largely ineffective when it comes to detecting spoof calls since they can only black-list against known scam numbers, not legitimate numbers that are momentarily hijacked by scammers,¡± First Orion said in a statement.

Cell phone users without adequate call blocking or call screening can be swamped everyday by fraudulent calls.

Carriers are trying to fight this. Verizon, for example, offers a spam filter app that can block calls based on the risk level set by the user.

Unfortunately, scammers are constantly changing tactics so it¡¯s a ¡°whack a mole¡± game trying to prevent the calls, a Verizon spokesperson told Fox News. ¡°It¡¯s a complicated problem with no simple solutions,¡± the spokesperson added.

And the problem is also a legal one. ¡°Currently it's not illegal to spoof another person's phone number,¡± Verizon told Fox News in an email. ¡°We support federal legislation that would go after the spammers that are making these calls.¡±

The FCC is working to boost measures to fight phone fraud via SHAKEN/STIR, a standard for the cryptographic signing of telephone calls. The goal is to eradicate spoofed numbers from the telephone system.

US IS THE WORLD'S HOTSPOT FOR MALICIOUS WEBSITES



¡°A critical element of solving this problem is call authentication?essentially creating a ¡®digital fingerprint¡¯ for each phone call that scammers can¡¯t spoof or misuse,¡± FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in May.

For consumers, this means the number displayed on the Caller ID would be the number that the call actually originated from. This capability could be operational sometime next year.



First Orion, for its part, is planning to introduce its CallPrinting technology to carriers to thwart fraudulent calls later this year.

Phone scammers purporting to be from a Chinese consulate office are tricking people in the U.S. into handing over huge sums of money.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the Chinese-language calls appear to be going to ¡°people with Chinese last names.¡± Those outside the apparent target group may be unaffected by the racket, but the FTC warned everyone to be vigilant as ¡°scammers¡¯ tactics can change quickly.¡±

The commission said that people across the U.S. have been reporting the calls, which appear to deploy a range of tactics in a bid to trick the recipient. Some begin with an instruction to pick up a package at a nearby Chinese consular office, while others ask for information ¡°to avoid being in trouble with the Chinese consulate,¡± the FTC said. The scammer could also trick the person into thinking they¡¯re in some kind of trouble and could face arrest if they travel to China. At some point, the caller will ask for personal details such as bank or credit card information, or for a bank transfer to be made.

And the ruse is clearly working. Since December, 21 members of New York City¡¯s Chinese community have lost a total of $2.5 million, according to the New York Police Department, with individuals reporting losses ranging from $1,800 to $1.4 million, according to Voices of NY. Some have lost their life savings.

The caller IDs appear to indicate that the calls are coming from a local number, but investigators say it¡¯s actually coming from a location in China.

 The FTC reminded people never to send money to anyone who asks you to do so over the phone.

¡°Never give your Social Security number, your bank or credit card number, or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it,¡± the commission said. ¡°Same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as WeChat: just don¡¯t respond. That¡¯s a scam. And neither the real Chinese consulates, nor the Chinese Embassy, will ever call you to ask for money.¡±

The FTC told recipients of such scam calls to act decisively: ¡°If you get a call or message like this, hang up or delete it, and then tell the FTC. If you have business with the real Chinese consulate and you¡¯re worried, contact the real Chinese Consulate by looking up your local office¡¯s number. But, whatever you do, don¡¯t give out your information ? or your money ? to anyone who contacts you out of the blue.¡±

More than 100 phone calls have flooded the Portage County Sheriff's Office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers. Victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested.

This is the latest scam hitting residents in Portage County where even the sheriff received one of those calls. "I actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up. I played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes I asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him? I said I am the local sheriff and he hung up," explained Sheriff Mike Lukas, Portage County Sheriff's Office.

The scammers use fake names and bogus IRS identification numbers and, in some cases, they may know a lot about who they are calling. Even the caller ID can appear to look like it is the IRS.

Jennifer Sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls. She got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year.

"Earlier this year I got a voicemail that I was going to be taken into custody and I thought 'oh my god what do I do?' but this one I was kind of taken like this isn't real. They were saying I was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name," said Sisley.

If you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information.

"Immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay. Those are definitely scams," said Sheriff Lukas.

"Just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it," said Sisley.

NBN robocall scam threatens to disconnect households from the internet

A phone scam claiming to be from the National Broadband Network (NBN) has ramped up in Queensland, with one woman harassed eight times in the past three days.

The ABC has been told the robocalls include an automated voice, warning the NBN would be turned off in the local area so maintenance work could be undertaken.

People are prompted to press "1" to discuss the matter further, or "2" to disconnect from the internet.

Beryce Nelson from Toogoolawah in the Brisbane Valley said the NBN was not available in her area, so she knew it was some kind of scam.

"I've had eight of them over the past three days, repeated calls ? robocalls ? from an organisation or group of people pretending to be NBN, and I would think that there would be something involving your bank account details if you did get into any discussion with them," she said.

"I was intimidated the second and third time and it's because I thought, 'Well maybe it is the NBN', and then I thought, 'No don't be silly ? we don't have the NBN'."

She said she hung up the phone and did not engage, but was worried not everyone would realise the calls were part of a scam.

"The electronic voice is very authoritative and scary," Ms Nelson said.

"I just want to let people know that if they get this call, it's not fair dinkum, because if you were in an NBN area, you might very well think it was real."

Detectives from the Montgomery County police financial crimes unit are investigating a phone scam targeting Chinese residents that has resulted in seven county residents of Chinese descent wiring a total of $1.5 million to the scammers.

Five of the victims live in the western part of the county, in Boyds, Germantown and Rockville, Detective Brandon Mengedoht said Friday. Two of the victims are from Silver Spring.

¡°We believe it is affinity fraud where they target people in their own community,¡± Mengedoht said. ¡°The victims have wired money to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.¡±

The scammers calling potential victims speak in a Chinese dialect and claim to represent a Chinese or Hong Kong government organization, such as a law enforcement agency, a government prosecutor or the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., according to a police press statement issued Friday.

The victims are told they have been involved in some type of wrongdoing and that they need to wire money to China or Hong Kong in order to resolve the problem.

In some cases, a victim receives an additional phone call during which a scammer says the person was not involved in wrongdoing, but is instead a victim of identity theft and that additional money is needed to clear the person¡¯s name.

Victims are prompted to give personal and banking information, according to police.

¡°The receiver is threatened that if he/she does not comply, he will face consequences to include deportation and detention in a Chinese prison,¡± the police release said. ¡°The receiver is also told not disclose the issue to anyone.¡±

Investigators are urging residents to share the information about the scam, particularly with those of Chinese descent.

¡°If you receive a call to send money immediately in order to avoid prosecution or an arrest, it¡¯s going to be a scam,¡± Mengedoht said.

Residents who think they have been victims of the scam are asked to call the police department at 240-774-6330.

Two seemingly innocuous text messages from Optus were the first signs that hackers had taken control of a Sydney woman's mobile phone and were rapidly stealing her identity.

She didn't know it at the time, but Kate* was the helpless target of a little-known scam called 'SIM swapping', where hackers can gain access to your bank account, email and social media with just a simple phone call to a mobile operator.

Armed with Kate's name, date of birth and number, hackers phoned up the Optus call centre and without her knowledge or consent secretly swapped her phone number to a SIM card held by them.

The two text messages sent by Optus confirmed Kate's "issue" had been resolved. Kate assumed both unexpected texts related to a complaint she had made several weeks earlier. The reality was she'd just been hijacked.

Hackers then quickly broke into her social media accounts and email, where she had stored many personal documents including passport scans and other important information. SIM swap scammers have also been known to successfully crack banking apps linked to mobile phone numbers.

Optus is not the lone target of SIM swap hackers, with reports other Australian mobile phone operators have also been duped. The relative ease with which hackers can execute SIM swaps poses serious questions about the level of security clearance mobile phone operators enforce.

Kate believes the hackers initially swiped her personal details, such as her date of birth, from her Facebook account. Within hours of Kate's phone dropping dead from the network, one of her friends was already being targeted.

Once a Facebook user's account is compromised by SIM scammers, any Facebook friends who list their date of birth and phone number on their personal page will also become vulnerable.

Hackers made numerous phone calls using Kate's number and changed the password of her email and a variety of other accounts.

"After they have control they can use your phone number to get codes for emails, banking and everything," Kate said.

"They can also begin opening up other types of online accounts.

"They need so little information ... I think this is the biggest problem."

Kate contacted Optus via its online chat support and said it took 30 minutes before someone took her complaint seriously.

"First they told me, 'I think someone is doing work in your area', to explain why I had no network coverage," she told nine.com.au.

Eventually an Optus help desk employee informed Kate a hacker had taken control of her number with just the basic details. A block was then put on her number.

"You just don't feel safe. It feels like it can happen again," she said.

More than 200,000 scam reports were submitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in 2017.

Latest ACCC data revealed Australians lost $340 million to scammers last year ? a $40 million increase from 2016.

Email has been the primary hunting ground for scammers, but society's growing reliance on mobile phones means that platform will be increasingly heavily targeted.

An Optus spokeswoman told nine.com.au SIM swapping "is an industry-wide issue and we are working together with other telecommunication providers and major banks to mitigate opportunities for fraudulent activity".

The spokeswoman said by the time a fraudster requested a SIM swap - known in the industry as "porting" - the victim and their personal details would have likely already been compromised through a phishing scam or mail theft.

"Unauthorised 'porting' of a number is undertaken by criminals with the intent to access bank accounts," the spokeswoman said.

The spokeswoman said a scammer would need "account detail information" to execute a SIM swap, but did not specify precisely what that entailed.

Worried hackers had access to her passport scans and other tier one type identification documents, Kate went to the NSW police.

"The police told me there was not a financial loss so they can't do anything," Kate said.

She was instructed to lodge a complaint with ACORN, the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network.

Kate said mobile phone companies, such as Optus, need to make it harder for scammers to SIM swap and hijack someone's online identity.

Many of us are already conditioned to ignore phone calls from unknown numbers. A new study seems to validate that M.O.

By next year, nearly half of the mobile phone calls we get will be scams, according to a new report from First Orion, a company that provides calls management and protection for T-Mobile, MetroPCs, Virgin Mobile and others.

The percentage of scam calls in US mobile traffic increased from 3.7 percent last year to 29.2 percent this year, and it's predicted to rise to 44.6 percent in 2019, First Orion said in a press release Wednesday.

The most popular method scammers use to try to get people to pick up the phone is called "neighborhood spoofing," where they disguise their numbers with a local prefix so people presume the calls are safe to pick up, First Orion said. Third-party call blocking apps may help protect consumers from known scam numbers, but they can't tell if a scammer hijacks someone's number and uses it for scam calls.

"Year after year, the scam call epidemic bombards consumers at record-breaking levels, surpassing the previous year and scammers increasingly invade our privacy at new extremes," First Orion CEO Charles Morgan said in the press release.

First Orion in April testified before the US House Committee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection about combating robocalls, scam calls and caller ID spoofing with technologies. The company works with carrier giants like T-Mobile to alert consumers of scam calls by displaying "Scam Likely" as caller ID on their phones.

"Scammers relentlessly inundate mobile phones with increasingly convincing and scary calls," said Gavin Macomber, senior vice president of marketing at First Orion, in an email statement. "Solving a problem of this magnitude requires a comprehensive, in-network carrier solution that dives deeper than third-party applications ever could by detecting and eliminating unwanted and malicious calls before they reach your phone."

Recently, a retired police officer received a call from a man who claimed he was collecting money for the American Police Officer¡¯s Alliance.

He stated that the organization provided training and equipment for police officers across the nation and that funds were needed ¡°to keep our officers safe.¡±

The retired officer told the caller he was a retired officer and had never heard of his organization nor received any training or equipment funds from them.

The officer asked the caller where they were located and how long they had been around, and the caller thanked him and hung up.

The phone number that appeared was 267-843-1255, generated from the Philadelphia area.

However, upon further review, the organization was not listed on the IRS website, and any attempt to call the number back led to an automated message saying that all agents were busy at that time.

Police are urging residents to be caution when receiving unsolicited phone calls asking for donations.

He needed money, and his friend knew someone who knew someone. That¡¯s how Ah Wei* got started in the phone scam business ? first as a runner collecting victim¡¯s money from ATMs, then as a phone operator and manager of a call centre in Taiwan. He says he¡¯s also recruited and trained others in the psychology of scamming.

¡°Usually, we play on people¡¯s anxieties and fears,¡± he told SBS Viceland¡¯s The Feed. ¡°And we keep them on the phone and don¡¯t give them time to think¡±.

Mandarin speakers in Australia have recently been targeted in an elaborate phone scam - police say victims have paid more than $9 million. The caller says they¡¯re from DHL or the Chinese consulate, and then transfers the phone to a person pretending to be from the police or Interpol.

It¡¯s a lucrative trade. One Chinese student in Australia, Xiao Chen*, told The Feed that she handed over nearly $500,000 during a 10 day-long ordeal.

Ah Wei is familiar with this kind of set-up.

¡°I¡¯ll call and say you¡¯ve been implicated in a criminal case, we have a subpoena and you have to appear at court to explain. But you have to pay a security bond, to ensure you don¡¯t flee the country.¡±

Another, that¡¯s recently been seen in Australia, targets parents. According to Ah Wei, they¡¯re told their son or daughter has been kidnapped or will be harmed unless the parents pay some money.

¡°If you¡¯re dealing with a daughter, you arrange to have a woman in the background screaming ¡®mum, help me...¡¯. (The parents) will think their daughter is being hit.¡±

The scams are often run from rented villas that are set-up solely for the purpose of making the calls.

Ah Wei says phone operators are recruited by word-of-mouth and recruitment ads. The workers are trained and given scripts, and a list of phone numbers and personal information. They¡¯re not allowed to leave the house while the scam operation is underway - this could be anywhere from one to three months.

¡°A lot of people hear how much they can earn, and even though they know it¡¯s a scam, they¡¯ll still do it,¡± according to Ah Wei.

Phone scams originating in Taiwan date back to the late 1990s . They¡¯ve since evolved, and syndicates have branched out overseas. Some call centres have even been located in Australia.

Ah Wei says he¡¯s now out of the game because he began to understand just who he was taking money from.

¡°One time I came across a little old lady at the bank who¡¯d been scammed out of $27,000. Her children were standing there abusing her. I thought, what if that money was part of what I¡¯d taken that day? What if my mother was scammed?¡±

Ah Wei now wants to give advice to people who suspect there¡¯s a scammer on the other end of the line.

¡°Take the time to think it over with a cool-head. Don¡¯t just believe what a stranger on the phone says.¡±

DALLAS (CBS Local)- Dallas-based AT&T is warning its customers about a new scam that is targeting customers.

According to WAFB, customers have been reporting calls in which the caller tells them that their service is being suspended until they verify their account.

The caller then asks for the customer to give the last four digits of their Social Security Number.

In a statement to the station, AT&T says that the calls are not coming from the company and that customers need to be vigilant about any calls in which a company asks you to verify personal information.

¡°These calls are not from us. If any company calls you and asks for your personal information, that is a red flag. One of our tips on our new Cyber Aware website is never give such information to someone who calls you. Call the company at the number found on your bill.¡±

A Calgary grandmother outsmarted would-be phone scammers and is now warning others to be cautious of the sophisticated scheme.

Anne Buckley was at home on Saturday when she got an unexpected call to her landline.

"It was a very classy-sounding lady with a lovely British accent who said she was the manager of Tiffany's in Chinook [mall]," Buckley said.

The woman, who said her name was Mary Gilmore, said she was calling to warn Buckley someone was trying to charge $14,000 to her credit card.

The woman had Buckley's name and home address and told her they would not ask her for personal information but insisted Buckley call her bank.

CBC News previously reported on this scam back in February when victims in Toronto were duped out of more than $5 million.

It usually goes like this: scammers call the would-be victim on their landline and purport to be a retailer contacting the victim to report their credit card is being used for a fraudulent purchase.

The caller tells the victim to contact 911, or, in some cases, their bank, to alert them to the attempted fraud.

The crux of the scam involves the victim, believing the caller has hung up, dials 911 or their bank. In reality, the scammer remains on the line and the victim then speaks to another partner in the scam, posing as police or a bank investigator.

In the case of the Toronto victims, they were urged to transfer money into a specific, separate bank account to protect it during the "investigation."

Buckley believes in this case, they wanted to pose as her bank so she would reveal her credit card information.

While the woman on the other end of the line sounded convincing and wasn't asking for any personal information, Buckley knew something wasn't right and remembered reading about a similar incident in the news.

"I remembered the story, so I wasn't phoning my bank or anyone from my landline," Buckley said.

"I looked online and there had been no purchases go through my card, however I was concerned. I thought it was a scam but I really wanted to make sure this wasn't going through on my card, so I phoned Tiffany's."

The employee at Tiffany's confirmed Buckley's suspicions that no Mary Gilmore worked at that store. They also told Buckley she was the seventh person to call with the same concerns that day.

When Buckley failed to use her landline within five to 10 minutes, the fake Tiffany's manager called again and asked if she had made the call and kept pressing her to do it.

She also said Buckley could give them the phone number off the back of her credit card ? which would reveal which company she deals with.

Tiffany & Co. confirms there is an open investigation into the matter with the Calgary Police Service. Buckley has been in touch with police to have her information added to the file.

- We all get them: the never-ending robocalls.

¡°In the last week and a half, probably three or four a day,¡± said Jon Lane, of Sanford.

¡°I'm on every do not call list I can be on. I would say at least five a day,¡± said Sandy Nicholas, of Lake Mary.

Now the State of Florida is taking a stance.

"It is a nuisance. A lot of times, these scam artists are trying to prey on our most vulnerable populations,¡± said Devin Galetta, from the Department of Financial Services.

The Department of Financial Services is pushing for harsher penalties and bigger fines against the phone scammers doing neighborhood spoofing. You know which kind of robocalls we¡¯re talking about.

¡°Somehow they get your number and then they use it and it looks like it's from your neighbor,¡± said Nicholas.

¡°They show up usually with a similar area code to my phone number and I've really just been ignoring them,¡± said Lane.

It¡¯s those spoofing calls that can be the most dangerous. If you even answer with a simple hello, the scammer may be recording your voice.

That¡¯s why the Better Business Bureau says with any of these calls, ¡°if you don¡¯t know the phone number, just don¡¯t answer it,¡± said Erika Urdaneta.

If you already have, Urdaneta says ¡°just listen. see what they have to say. Don't say yes. Don't give any of your information.¡±

The embassy also advised recipients of such calls or SMS to refrain from transferring any money or bank accounts details of the callers.

Recently, the so-called ¡®¡¯World Winner¡¯¡¯ lottery swindled many people with fraudulent calls about winners. Several such cases happened in Singapore, according to Singapore police.

¡°They are targeting not only Myanmar nationals but also other foreigners. I haven¡¯t heard any reported cases on this illegal activity,¡± Ma Aye Mar Mar, who works in Singapore, told The Myanmar Times.

She added that the culprits often ask for bank details to allegedly transfer the winnings of the lucky draw.

¡°If we give them our bank account details and phone number, they can take out all of the money from our account,¡± said Ma Aye Mar Mar.

She was targetted by such a scam last week in Singapore, but did not provide any information. Ma Aye Mar Mar posted her experience on Facebook to raise awareness.

The Myanmar embassy urged Myanmar nationals targetted by such scams to immediately report them to the Singapore police with screenshots.

The Blount County Sheriff¡¯s Office is warning residents of a phone scam in the Maryville area.

The phone scammers are calling Blount County residents and claiming to be Blount County Sheriff¡¯s Office employees. The calls typically include claims of an arrest warrant for unpaid traffic tickets.

The caller then tells the individual they need to buy a prepaid credit card to pay the balance or they will be arrested.

The sheriff¡¯s office posted a statement on its Facebook page that the office ¡°will never call an individual to tell them that they owe money on an unpaid traffic ticket or any other costs.¡±

The post also emphasized the office will never ask anyone to purchase a prepaid credit card to pay outstanding fines.

Phone scams are becoming more and more common across the country, but a new scam has people in Brown County concerned.

Brown county Sheriff John Merchant said these scam calls involve credit card offers that are too good to be true.

"We have several residents who have some concerns, they've been contacted by people over the phone that have alluded to the fact that they were offering credit cards if they would take a card out, they would give them a 500 dollar credit," he said.

Merchant says the callers have heavy foreign accents and have been asking for bank account numbers - claiming to need it for credit card verification.

"Thank goodness the people that have been receiving the offers have been very, very cautious,¡± he said.

¡°They did not give out any information and they said when they started questioning these people the callers became very agitated and then they hung up."

"If something sounds too good to be true it is, just hang your phone up. Nobody is going to give away something for nothing."

Merchant says you can help.

"Be extra cautious, be extra vigilant. If you're a victim of a scam, notify your local law-enforcement agency at once ¡¦ we get dozens of complaints on different scams every week. They let us know about that so we can share it with others so they don't become victims."

Merchant says you should never give away personal information over the phone.

Thousands of people across NSW have reported receiving a call from someone speaking in Mandarin, and police are aware of people who have fallen victim to the scam.

Investigators have been told the calls involve demands for money under the threat of violence or harm to the receiver, their family and/or friends.

There have been reports victims across Australia, as well as New Zealand, USA, Canada, and United Kingdom, have been scammed of millions of dollars.

¡°The caller purports to be a government official and the essence of the scam is to convince the victim they are in trouble, but they can pay their way out of it,¡± Det Supt Howlett said.

¡°We¡¯ve been told victims are contacted either on their mobile phone or via an app, such as ¡®WeChat¡¯, and while the incoming number appears to be from a local landline, it has been ¡®spoofed¡¯ or ¡®ported¡¯ to an unknown location.

¡°The call often starts with a recorded message in English or Mandarin, and transfers to a person claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.

¡°The caller claims the victim has been implicated in a crime or their identity has been stolen, which could impact on their visa to stay in Australia or harm could come to their family back home.

¡°The victim is then told the call will be transferred to the ¡°investigators¡± or ¡°police¡±, who demand personal details, including bank accounts, PINs, passports, family information, and in some cases, cash payments.

¡°In some cases, the victim is told not to speak to friends or family as it may put them in danger too.¡±

¡°They have advised they would never call citizens to convey the notice of Chinese police, financial institutions, or other organisations,¡± Det Supt Howlett said.

¡°While we are working with our law enforcement colleagues to investigate the origins of the scam, we are urging the community to heed our warning not to respond to the caller¡¯s demands.

Police are urging anyone with information that may assist investigators in relation to this scam to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: nsw.crimestoppers.com.au.

Further, police remind the public to take the following precautions to reduce the risk of being scammed by cold-callers:

If you have been the victim of a scam, you can report it to local police or to the ACCC online at the ¡®SCAMwatch report a scam¡¯ page or by calling 1300 795 995.

A call-blocking technology firm recently predicted that next year, nearly half of all cell phone calls will be from scammers.

The firm, First Orion, is predicting that 45 percent of cell phone calls will be scams in 2019. That's from 3.7 percent of total calls in 2017 to more than 29 percent this year.

One of the most recent techniques scammers are using is called neighborhood spoofing. It involves the scammers phone number coming up on your caller ID with the same area code and prefix as your phone number.

Steven Andres, SDSU management information systems lecturer, will join Midday Edition on Wednesday to discuss this technique and the ways individuals can avoid these calls.

The latest wave of an international phone scam is affecting New Zealanders and mobile companies are warning people not to call back.

The scam appears as a missed international phone call and charges the user hefty international fees if they return it.

2degrees spokesman Paul Brislen said the scam is unsophisticated but is affecting mobile phone users from multiple international networks.

The scam is computer generated and almost impossible to stop as the calling number changes every time, he said.

"You start off with 001001 and that doesn't ring so you go through to 001002 and that one rings, great we've got a live number, then they try 001003 and they just make their way up the number range until they hit out numbers.

"So I presume they've reached the +64 bracket, which is New Zealand, and they're trying all the numbers they can find", he said.

Eventually the scammers will move on to target other international numbers, he said.

Customers who have returned unknown international phone calls should check their phone bills and contact their network if they've been affected, he said.

Spark said its customers have also been targeted while a Vodafone user told RNZ of getting repeated missed calls from a Canadian number for months.
###########################################################################################
Finally, a little justice for the scammers who prey on the unsuspecting. Twenty-four more phone scammers have received prison sentences of up to 20 years for fraud and money laundering. The extent of their efforts was truly staggering.

One defendant, Miteshkumar Patel of Illinois, received 240 months in prison followed by three years of probation. Patel, wrote the Department of Justice, ¡°served as the manager of a Chicago-based crew of ¡®runners¡¯ that liquidated and laundered fraud proceeds generated by callers at India-based call centers.¡±

Those callers used call scripts and lead lists to target victims throughout the United States with telefraud schemes in which the callers impersonated U.S. government employees from the IRS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The callers duped victims into believing that they owed money to the U.S. government and would be arrested or deported if they did not pay immediately. After the victims transferred money to the callers, a network of U.S.-based runners moved expeditiously to liquidate and launder fraud proceeds through the use of anonymous stored value cards. In addition to recruiting, training, and tasking runners in his crew, Patel also coordinated directly with the Indian side of the conspiracy about the operation of the scheme. Patel was held accountable for laundering between $9.5 and $25 million for the scheme.

The scam ? familiar to anyone with a phone number ? involves a robocall that appears to be from the IRS. When you call back, you get a call center staffed with threatening non-English speakers who yell at you if you try to weasel out of paying them with iTunes gift cards.

¡°This type of fraud is sickening,¡± said U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick in a release. ¡°However, after years of investigation and incredible hard work by multiple agents and attorneys, these con artists are finally headed to prison. Their cruel tactics preyed on some very vulnerable people, thereby stealing millions from them. These sentences should send a strong message that we will follow the trail no matter how difficult and seek justice for those victimized by these types of transnational schemes. We will simply not stand by and allow criminals to use the names of legitimate government agencies to enrich themselves by victimizing others.¡±

The fact that up to $25 million was collected in this scam is amazing. The resourcefulness and nastiness of this particular breed of scam is truly impressive, and Patel and 23 others will be going away for a while for their many crimes.

PERRY - Another scam is making the rounds in the metro.

A Perry woman says someone called her, claiming he worked for a tech company, in an attempt to remotely hack into her computer. She says it's been one major headache for her ever since then.

"He gave me my email address and said it was compromised, and I was like, he knows what he's talking about.," said Gerry Bacon of Perry. "He's got my email address. He's from Google."

"Sometimes that fear allows scammers to get into your computer," explained Perry Police Chief Eric Vaughn.

Bacon says she got a surprising call on Saturday morning.

"My son had Googled it while I was on the phone, and said, 'Mom, hang up it's a scam.' So, I hung up," she explained.

But she says the caller was persistent.

"Then, he tried calling back on a restricted number and he was like, why did you hang up on me?'" she recalled. "And I told him, 'Because you're a scam. You just hacked into my computer' And I hung up."

But the damage may have already been done. Bacon reached out to Perry Police and even the FBI for help.

"All my clients' information, addresses, phone numbers are on there," said Bacon. "So, I had to disconnect WiFi immediately."

Police say she's not the only one. They've been getting at least one call a week from scammers, who've gotten far more sophisticated with phones.

"Now, we see them spoofing local numbers even. If you don't recognize that number, let it go to voicemail and see what it says," said Vaughn.

"I have a cousin whose girlfriend got a call from '515' that did the same thing, and I have an elderly mom that's in the hospital, and so if I see a restricted number coming through, I'm going to take it because I bet it's going to be the hospital," said Bacon.

Bacon had to wipe her computer clean and she's frustrated that anyone would think to target her or anyone else like her.

"It's like, really, people," she said. "Come on, get better stuff to do than to bug us little people. If they want to take my credit and my identity, there's nothing there."

Police tell Local 5 that if someone calls you claiming to be with an agency like the IRS or Google, don't believe it. They will never call for collection over the phone. Also, be on the lookout for any time someone on the phone asks you to make a payment with a gift debit card or credit card.

Have you been receiving mobile phone calls from a number starting with the digits 0088?

People across Kilkenny have been reporting receiving calls from international numbers starting with 0088 or +88. Do not answer these calls as they are part of a scam.

The caller will allow the phone to ring a few times before hanging up, leading to missed call messages on your mobile.

Do NOT ring the number back. This is all part of the 'Wangiri' scam which originated in Japan but is now being used by con artists worldwide.

So how does it work?

In order for mobile phone networks across different countries to communicate with each other, there is a system set up that processes the connections and also makes sure that any international charges are passed on to the person making the call, from the country the call was made to.

For example, if it costs you ¢æ2 to call a mobile in South Africa, this system makes sure the right amount of charges are billed to you for that international connection time.

What's happening with the Wangiri scam is the fraudsters behind the con, compromise that system of international charges.

The fraudsters rely on you calling back the number after you note the missed call. Be warned that if you do, they pocket the cost per minute of that call and the charges are huge.

The best advice is to not answer any call from a number you don't recognise and never answer a number starting with 0088.

WICHITA FALLS (KFDX/KJTL) - The Better Business Bureau advises North Texans to ignore calls from someone claiming to be a government agency and immediately hang up because a new version of an old scam has resurfaced.

The scam is someone calling saying they are from a government agency and there is an issue with Social Security Number. But the BBB said there is an easy way of knowing if you received a scam or not.

The BBB of North Central Texas sent out a press release warning the public of phone scams. The BBB received the first Social Security phone scam on Sept. 19 Kris Altringer said she did not answer the call initially but when she called back. The scammer told her if she didn't give them her Social Security Number they would take legal Acton.

"I told them that they could go ahead with the legal proceedings and they said that law enforcement would be out to arrest me and I said that's fine I'll be waiting for them when should I expect them? And they told me a half hour," Altringer said.

President of the Wichita Falls BBB Monica Horton said unfortunately, they receive scam calls throughout the year.

"These days we are hearing from consumers that are constantly receiving calls from you know people that are trying to scam them. And these calls can become harassing. There's really nothing you can do to prevent you from receiving these calls. They cast a wide net," Horton said.

Horton says there is an easy way to know if it is a scam or not.

"The government organizations aren't going to call you unsolicited. They may return a phone call that you placed but usually their first form of contact is contacting you through the mail," Horton said.

If you do see a number you do not recognize, Horton says it is best to not answer it and if they leave you a suspicious message you can call the BBB to report it.

Most people think the age targeted the most is seniors but actually, it is 18- to 25-year-olds and according to Consumers Union, just last year phone scams cost people $350 million.

You can also report it online, for the information on how to do that, click here.

Some say there's a fix available to help stop them that's rarely used.

Turns out phone companies can use stir/shaken to authenticate the number for every call with a digital fingerprint.

Calls without that special ID may be flagged or even blocked. Problem is Stir/shaken appears to be on hold.

The FCC hopes some companies will implement it within the year.

Tax season may be over for most taxpayers, but when it comes to identity theft, scammers are still hard at work. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is warning taxpayers about a "new twist on an old phone scam." In the scam, thieves use telephone numbers that look like IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC) office numbers to trick taxpayers into paying fake tax bills. Here's what you need to know.

In the latest version of the phone scam, criminals purporting to be from your local IRS TAC office are making calls demanding tax payments. Your caller ID may even display a TAC number during the call since the scammers have programmed their computers to display the TAC telephone number. If you question whether the call is legitimate, the crooks will advise you to double-check the local TAC number with the IRS.gov website. Then the scammers call you back and demand payment again, usually by debit card.

Like most big agencies, the IRS has a division of labor. Collection efforts typically stem from - you guessed it - the Collections Department and involve a series of notices sent by U.S. Mail (for more info, check out IRS Pub 594, The Collections Process, which downloads as a pdf). Your first contact from collections will not begin with a phone call.

TAC offices do not make calls to taxpayers to demand payment of outstanding tax bills. Rather, TAC offices offer in-person help for taxpayers. Some TAC offices also offer in-person document review for form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (downloads as a pdf). All TAC offices operate by appointment only (find one near you here).

The calls are being spoofed, meaning that the scammers have changed the caller ID to make it look like they are calling from an IRS TAC office. Don't be fooled. Scammers also have spoofed local police offices, the Department of Motor Vehicles, immigration agencies and other federal agencies in an effort to convince taxpayers the call is legitimate. Spoofing also happens in emails: Thieves will tamper with the "from" line in scam emails to make you believe that the email is from the IRS or other agency.

Use care. Don't engage with scammers or thieves, even if you want to tell them that you know it's a scam, or you think that you can best them. Just hang up.

If you feel like you've heard these warnings before, you're not wrong: The IRS still says that phone scams are "a major threat to taxpayers." In 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reports they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Don't be a victim. Remember that the IRS will never:
? Call to demand immediate payment over the phone, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.
? Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
? Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
? Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.
? Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

Again, don't engage or respond with scammers. Here's what to do if you receive a suspicious phone call or message:
? If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you do not owe tax, or if you are immediately aware that it's a scam, don't engage with the scammer and do not give out any information. Just hang up.
? If you receive a telephone message from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you do not owe tax, or if you are immediately aware that it's a scam, don't call them back.

(9/13/2018) - More than 100 phone calls have flooded the Portage County Sheriff's Office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers.

Victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested.

This is the latest scam hitting residents in Portage County where even the sheriff received one of those calls.

"I actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up. I played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes I asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him? I said I am the local sheriff and he hung up," said Portage County Sheriff Mike Lukas.

The scammers use fake names and bogus IRS identification numbers and, in some cases, they may know a lot about who they are calling. Even the caller ID can appear to look like it is the IRS.

Jennifer Sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls. She got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year.

"Earlier this year I got a voicemail that I was going to be taken into custody and I thought 'Oh my god what do I do?' But this one I was kind of taken like this isn't real. They were saying I was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name," said Sisley.

If you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information.

"Immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay. Those are definitely scams," said Sheriff Lukas.

"Just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it," said Sisley.

To file a complaint with the IRS click here or contact the IRS by calling 800-366-4484.

You've probably got the call: An automated message threatens you with arrest over unpaid taxes. Call back and you'll be further threatened by someone claiming to be an agent of Canada Revenue Agency.

They may demand as little as $700 ? though some have handed over more than $100,000.

At least 60,000 Canadians have complained about being targeted by the phone scam over the past five years. More than $10 million dollars has been stolen in that same time period, making it one of the largest cyberscams in Canadian history.

After weeks of investigating and cultivating sources inside the scam centres, CBC's Marketplace tracked some of the calls to a nondescript, low-rise apartment building in one of Mumbai's seedier neighbourhoods.

When our team went to confront the scammers, a group of men ? believed to be armed ? gave chase through the crowded, sometimes dangerous alleyways of India's largest city.

"They're nothing but financial terrorists," said Ritesh Bhatia, a top cybercrime investigator in India. "It's a huge operation, a big industry."

Who falls for the scam?

Gehangir Rashidi, 63, funnelled an astounding $110,000 ? his entire life savings, and then some ? into bitcoin machines around Toronto after getting one of these threatening calls at home, saying he owed back taxes.

"I said 'I don't have it,'" Rashidi recalls telling the scammers. "They said, 'Go and borrow it from the bank. Go to a friend. Go to your employer. Go wherever you can to make money, but you have to pay."

Rashidi is deeply embarrassed he fell for the scam now. But at the time, the immigrant believed a government would call and threaten a citizen; it happens in his native Iran.

Most potential victims simply hang up, or never return the call. But the scammers are also employing new tactics in an attempt to convince people to hand over their cash, from posing as a victim's accountant, to using technology which prevents a victim from hanging up the phone.

The most sought-after prey are often the most vulnerable in Canada: the elderly and new immigrants.

How the scammers do it?

Robo-dialers call Canadian cellphones and landlines en masse, leaving a message that tells the recipient to call back. Those who do begin with a "call opener" who typically outlines a series of threats, including arrest, loss of employment, seizure of assets, and even the removal of their children.

But just as quickly, they offer to help the caller clear his or her name through a quick payment and a reduced fine, often in the thousands of dollars.

If a caller agrees, they are transferred to a "call closer," much like in a sales operation, who continues listing off threats and outlines where the money should come from and how it should be transferred. These details are often described in such a way as to avoid raising the suspicions of a bank.

After digging up information about a caller online, such as where they live and work, the scammers rely on mapping tools to identify the nearby banks, directing the victim to these locations.

In some cases, if you try to hang up ? to call your accountant, bank or a family member ? the scammers may use something known as call-trapping software, says Bhatia, which prevents your line from hanging up. The technology is more often used in espionage, but less reliable versions of the software can be purchased online, and may only trap a phone line for a couple of minutes.

That's what happened to a Toronto-area man we're calling Joe. Marketplace is protecting his identity, as he worries his employer will judge him for a mistake that cost him $36,600.

"Since I come in this country, I start to save money ? it's about 28 years," he said.

The scammers were firm with Joe, but told him they were there to help. He was facing a tax problem, they said, but they could get him out of it ? if he acted fast.

'Joe' describes the impact of losing more than $36,000 to the CRA tax scam:

Joe was told to withdraw the cash and deposit it into a bitcoin machine. He went from branch to branch, drawing down his savings; he was instructed by the scammers to tell any suspicious bank employees he was buying furniture.

When Joe questioned them, they asked for his accountant's name, before seemingly dialing the phone. Another voice, pretending to be the accountant's office, confirmed the amount owing.

Other scammers in the operation were likely using this time to research details about Joe online, using the information to bolster their claims of legitimacy.

At the end of the call, when the money was sent, Joe said they laughed and hung up.

Those carrying out the scam are young, usually in their 20s, and veterans of Mumbai's legitimate call centres, where English-language skills and an understanding of Western countries are a must.

The earning potential is huge: a typical month's salary can be earned in just one night. The more you steal from an unsuspecting Canadian, the more you take home.

Jayesh Dubey, a former call centre employee turned whistleblower, once profited from the scheme. "It was big money," he said. "I cannot make it anywhere [else]."

The scam is especially lucrative for those at the top. One of the few kingpins to be arrested, Sagar (Shaggy) Thakkar, was in the process of buying a private plane when the Indian police swooped in.

Thakkar was swept up after a major raid that led to hundreds of arrests and prosecutions, after U.S. authorities got a tip and asked India to intervene in a similar IRS scam targeting Americans.

Since the high-profile arrests, criminal gangs have made their operations smaller and more agile, operating out of apartments or small commercial spaces that are easier to pack up and move. Fearful of being exposed, the masterminds often only hire those they know or those known to their existing staff.

Sudhir Kotian got the invite and went inside one of the scam centres with a hidden camera. Kotian was discovered and attacked, though he eventually managed to escape.

"I was screaming as they hit me ? they hit me, hit me, hit me. They slapped me, hit me a lot. I was screaming, 'Save me, save me,' and walking backward, screaming loudly."

Kotian's hair was pulled and his clothing ripped; his phone, wallet and camera were all taken.

Indian police say they are ready to crack down on these operations, but need Canadian police to tell them about victims ? and share details about the scammers.

Indian Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh said he only became aware that the scammers were targeting Canadians after he visited the RCMP website himself and saw a posting about it.

"Nobody contacted us from Canada. It doesn't seem right," he told Marketplace in an interview.

But in a statement later provided by the office of Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the RCMP is "most definitely" working with Indian law enforcement on CRA fraud-related complaints. The statement said: "Mr Singh is not among the partners the RCMP works with in India."

The statement also said that phone scams are part of what the National Cybercrime Co-ordination Unit, which was announced in the 2018 budget, will be tackling.

This man infiltrated one of the illegal call centres behind those fake CRA calls:

The RCMP declined repeated requests for an on-camera interview on the CRA phone scam, and didn't answer questions about what specific actions they've taken to investigate the illegal overseas call centres.

"Fraud is a global problem without borders," the RCMP said in a statement. "By working with various municipal, provincial and national law enforcement and government partners, the RCMP is committed to preventing, detecting and deterring crimes that affect the economic integrity of Canada."

The federal policing agency added that "the best way" to combat these types of crime is through prevention. "Public awareness is an important tool in preventing the victimization of Canadians."

The Mounties also produce a regular report on cybercrime in Canada. In 2014, the report noted phone-based scams are notable for their frequency ? part of a trend suggesting that cybercrime is on the rise.

The CRA has a warning on its website that it won't leave personal information on voicemail, and that its agents do not use "aggressive language" or threaten taxpayers with arrest. When in doubt, the CRA suggests you hang up and either check your account online or call the agency back at 1-800-959-8281.

No, you are not about to be arrested because of a phone call saying you owe the IRS, Social Security or local law enforcement office money.

Green Bay Police say they received a number of calls Thursday from people who were targeted by a phone scam. The caller claims to be a "Deputy Adams" from the Brown County Sheriff's Department, who says they need to withdraw money or face a warrant for their arrest.

Action 2 News has also received reports from viewers Thursday of scams from callers claiming to be with the IRS or Social Security.

Target 2 Consumer Alert reported on one of these scam calls on Sunday. Ironically, the scam is using a phone number that used to belong to an attorney in New York state.

Police remind people to never provide money or personal information to someone over the phone if you didn't solicit the call.

Remember that no government or law enforcement agency, utility or credit card company is going to require a specific form of payment such as a prepaid debit card, wire transfer or iTunes gift card.

If you get a call like this, hang up -- or don't even pick up the phone if Caller ID shows a number you don't recognize.

If they leave a voicemail, don't call the phone number they provide. Instead, look up the actual phone number of the organization they claim to be with -- the local sheriff's office, IRS, Social Security, the utility, the credit card company, etc. Find out if they are looking for you or if an account is overdue.

Police are warning the public about a phone scam in which people are told there¡¯s a warrant out for their arrest.

RCMP Cpl. Jodi Shelkie said local Mounties have received numerous reports of the scam, perpetrated by someone claiming to be a police officer.

¡°The scammer informs them that there¡¯s a warrant for their arrest,¡± she said.

¡°They¡¯re instructed to meet the police officers at an address such as a local shopping centre in order to pay for some alleged fines, or they¡¯re instructed to deposit bitcoin into an account.¡±

Shelkie said the calls, in some cases, have shown the name and phone number of the Kamloops RCMP detachment (250-828-3000) on call display.

¡°If you receive a phone call like this, hang up,¡± Shelkie said.

¡°You will never receive a phone call that tells you there¡¯s a warrant issued for your arrest. Those matters are handled via paper documentation.¡±

Shelkie urged anyone targeted by the scammers to contact the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

There's a new phone scam doing the rounds - do NOT answer to or call back this number

Be on your guard with this one.

Irish people have been targeted by a phone scam over this week as fraudsters attempt to extract money from unsuspecting members of the public.

The scam - known as 'Wangiri fraud' - involves an unknown number calling your phone and leaving you with a missed call. When people call the number back, their phone credit is drained or a hefty charge is added to their phone bill.

The calls in Ireland appear to be originating from Bosnia and are either leaving you with a missed call or asking you to hold on the line while they redirect you to another more expensive number.

People have been reporting that the number looks like it's from Ireland, as it starts with 087, but it has been declared unsafe on phonenumbers.ie.

The same number, 087 655 60811, has been reported numerous times:

Scammers carry out the fraud by buying up a range of numbers and then using machines to make short automated calls to people, short enough so that no one has time to answer.

If you receive a missed call from a number like this:
? Do not call back. If it's legitimate call, the chances are they will phone you again.
? Be vigilant if calling unknown numbers from different countries.

Irish public warned of new phone scam claiming that their internet needs to be fixed

Be on your guard.

Members of the public are advised to be on alert following a series of scam phone calls over the past few days.

The scam in question concerns an automated recording that falsely claims to be an Eir technician looking to repair customer's internet connections.

The recording says that the person's connection is compromised, and prompts them to transfer to an operator in order to fix it.

From there, it appears that people are asked to present personal details or part with a sum of money in order to solve a non-existent issue.

Labour Party member Peter Horgan used social media to flag suspicious calls in County Cork, following numerous reports coming his way from concerned local citizens.

Communications regulator ComReg notes that there is no method to identity a scam call number, and they can resemble a normal, familiar, geographical or international number that people would come across on a daily basis.

They offer the following advice for the general public:
? Be wary of multiple calls/missed calls being received from the same number that you are unfamiliar with
? Do not call back any number that you don¡¯t recognise where there is a blank or no voicemail message left
? If you dial back an unknown number by mistake, hang up immediately on calls where there appears to be no recipient on the other end or where you are left on hold
? If you have friends or relatives abroad that may be calling you, store their number (including the country prefix) in your phone and be aware of the prefix for the country where they might be calling from
? If you are getting persistent missed calls from an unknown number, or if you return a call to an unknown number, contact your service provider in the first instance and follow their code of practice, details of which are available on their website
? Do not provide any personal information, for example, banking details/PPS number/credit card details/name and address/passport numbers etc.
