qualified to receive a grant and needed to share some of his personal financial information before the payment would be released although the man sounded like a person of authority , larocque was suspicious for one thing , larocque is canadian , not american , so how could he be eligible for money from the irs \? the second red flag may have been even more telling the call had gone to larocque

trying to scam him he asked questions , and found the caller s responses to be vague and evasive eventually , the supposed irs agent hung up on him out of frustration if a person is refusing to provide answers to very basic questions , it s a good indication that it s a scam , larocque said wednesday larocque was speaking at a press conference announcing the latest developments in the rcmp s ongoing battle against the indian call centres believed to be behind the canada revenue agency scam the cra scam typically takes the form of a phone call in which the recipient is told they owe money to the agency and are threatened with arrest if they do not pay the scammers often try to receive their money via bitcoin , gift cards , wire transfer or another unusual method of payment more than 74 , 000 complaints about the scam have been filed since the canadian anti fraud centre began tracking the activity in 2014 an estimated 4 , 000 canadians have lost more than 15 million to the scam over the same time period none of that money is believed to have been recovered , and authorities believe there are many more victims who have never reported the crimes to police one blow was struck

peter payne said at wednesday s press conference police have responded in kind three call centres in india were raided over the past few weeks , payne said , with several fraudsters arrested authorities did not have information on exactly how many people were arrested or where in india the call centres were located , but did say that officers were able to seize a spreadsheet containing information about more than 600 canadian victims the takedown of the call centres has been important for disruption of fraudulent scams which affect canadians , payne said speakers at the press conference said enforcement was unlikely to ever bring cra scams to a complete halt , because the people behind them are able to shift their tactics to stay ahead of detection paine said one such change has even taken place in the past few years , with the large scale call centres like the one busted in 2016 replaced by smaller shops employing maybe a dozen or 15 people the officials stressed that the most effective tool to curb the spread of the scam is through education we know that other call centres will spring up but if we can really focus on prevention to educate people what is a fraud , then that will be better , larocque said through a french translator newcomers to canada are often said to be more at risk of becoming victims of the cra scam payne said the rcmp are looking

grandchild and then the scammer can easily play along , acting like they guessed right now the grandparent thinks they are talking to their grandchild don t miss how i got duped by a phishing scam the scam artist will then begin to confide in the grandparent , saying they are in a tough financial position and they need the grandparent s help asking them to send money to a western union or moneygram

and we look into the real deal behind those pricey and popular teatoxes chinese phone maker xiaomi is in damage control mode after an online promotion coinciding with its big uk launch somewhat backfired the plan was to offer handsets for just a quid in blighty , when a countdown on its uk website reached zero , with the impression being that if you clicked soon after the timer ran out , you 'd be able to snap up a pretty decent phone on the cheap thousands of people eagerly piled in , but were disappointed the offer was too good to be true when the countdown hit zero , the xiaomi website reported all of the 1 units were out of stock now some people , technical folks loving a bargain , had set up multiple web accounts to try and get hold of the cheap chinese kit when everyone seemingly struck out , these savvy netizens got suspicious , and one bright spark decided to dig a little deeper into the offer it appeared , from the public facing website code , that no attempt was made by the javascript to check for whether or not stock was available when the timer hit zero , hopefuls were simply told , sorry , there are no mega discounted handsets you 'll just have to pay the full price it thus appeared the website was hard coded to reject attempts to buy the offered 1 phones , leading some to assume it was all a scam to generate hype and publicity so we asked xiaomi what was going on its uk marketing boss got back to us in other words , this is n't a scam nor a bug , but a feature , of sorts it was a lottery , not a special offer get a load of people looking at the site , get them to compete for a bargain device per day , pick just a few lucky winners at random , and it 's done how do we know this \? as well as the above explanation , xiaomi actually stated it in the terms and conditions of the promotion , which were linked to at the bottom of the page so there you have it 10 phones for the 60 million people of the uk to fight over understandably , some british buyers were a little peeved if it was a lottery , it should have said so people thought it was a first come , first served special discount , with a decent stockpile of gear up for grabs , when really it was nothing of the sort it was a raffle draw of course , if a biz is offering you a new smartphone for a quid , you might well assume stocks are limited or some other catch applies in this case , there was a catch there were only a few devices available during each offer slash giveaway one might say it 's not entirely unreasonable to expect a phone maker to only offer a few devices at 1 anything else is commercial suicide the biz has since apologized , though , for the confusion , insisting it was a lost in translation blunder here 's the official statement we got on monday the promotion was originally named crazy deal and would make a total of 10 xiaomi smartphones available in the uk for 1 the devices were to be distributed in four phases at four time slots in each time slot , a total of three , three , two and then finally another two devices were included before launch however , concerned about the vagueness and potentially negative connotations of the term crazy deal , we changed the name of the promotion to flash sale unfortunately , we did not realise that the public associates this term with a very particular type of deal xiaomi has run for in the past across different global markets , where more than 10 devices were available this has led to concern on social media that the terms of the uk flash deal were unclear , and or that the devices were not available for 1 as promised we can confirm that 10 customers have received discount codes which will allow them to purchase a xiaomi device for 1 of the thousands who clicked buy simultaneously , our system will randomly select the winners , and he or she will be able to add this item to the shopping cart and pay this handset at 1 we re sorry so many of our mi fans missed out this time round , but we hope they ll take part in future flash sales as and when we announce them xiaomiuk would like to apologise for any misunderstanding for future deals , we will take into account the need for clarity and differentiating in promotions we are running we 'll be watching to see if the promotion results in any complaints to the regulators the advertising standards agency or local trading standards

was to offer handsets for just a quid in blighty , when a countdown on its uk website reached zero , with the impression being that if you clicked soon after the timer ran out , you 'd be able to snap up a pretty decent phone on the cheap thousands of people eagerly piled in , but were disappointed the offer was too good to be true when the countdown hit zero , the xiaomi website reported all of the 1 units were out of stock now some people , technical folks loving a bargain , had set up multiple web accounts to try and get hold of the cheap chinese kit when everyone seemingly struck out , these savvy netizens got suspicious , and one bright spark decided to dig a little deeper into the offer it appeared , from the public facing website code , that no attempt was made by the javascript to check for whether or not stock was available when the timer hit zero , hopefuls were simply told , sorry , there are no mega discounted handsets you 'll just have to pay the full price it thus appeared the website was hard coded to reject attempts to buy the offered 1 phones , leading some to assume it was all a scam to generate hype and publicity so we asked xiaomi what was going on its uk marketing boss got back to us in other words , this is n't a scam nor a bug , but a feature , of sorts it was a lottery , not a special offer get a load of people looking at the site , get them to compete for a bargain device per day , pick just a few lucky winners at random , and it 's done how do we know this \? as well as the above explanation , xiaomi actually stated it in the terms and conditions of the promotion , which were linked to at the bottom of the page so there you have it 10 phones for the 60 million people of the uk to fight over understandably , some british buyers were a little peeved if it was a lottery , it should have said so people thought it was a first come , first served special discount , with a decent stockpile of gear up for grabs , when really it was nothing of the sort it was a raffle draw of course , if a biz is offering you a new smartphone for a quid , you might well assume stocks are limited or some other catch applies in this case , there was a catch there were only a few devices available during each offer slash giveaway one might say it 's not entirely unreasonable to expect a phone maker to only offer a few devices at 1 anything else is commercial suicide the biz has since apologized , though , for the confusion , insisting it was a lost in translation blunder here 's the official statement we got on monday the promotion was originally named crazy deal and would make a total of 10 xiaomi smartphones available in the uk for 1 the devices were to be distributed in four phases at four time slots in each time slot , a total of three , three , two and then finally another two devices were included before launch however , concerned about the vagueness and potentially negative connotations of the term crazy deal , we changed the name of the promotion to flash sale unfortunately , we did not realise that the public associates this term with a very particular type of deal xiaomi has run for in the past across different global markets , where more than 10 devices were available this has led to concern on social media that the terms of the uk flash deal were unclear , and or that the devices were not available for 1 as promised we can confirm that 10 customers have received discount codes which will allow them to purchase a xiaomi device for 1 of the thousands who clicked buy simultaneously , our system will randomly select the winners , and he or she will be able to add this item to the shopping cart and pay this handset at 1 we re sorry so many of our mi fans missed out this time round , but we hope they ll take part in future flash sales as and when we announce them xiaomiuk would like to apologise for any misunderstanding for future deals , we will take into account the need for clarity and differentiating in promotions we are running we 'll be watching to see if the promotion results in any complaints to the regulators the advertising standards agency or local trading standards

's customer service in order to know what the balance on her account was she dialed the number listed on the back of her card and when a person answered , they claimed she had won a cruise as a result of being such a loyal customer her husband yves had the account since he was 18 years old , so sharon believed it was legit , telling global news they made it sounds so good the offer was that everything on the cruise was paid for except for the flights to florida and a 130 deposit on the room and food after sharon accepted the offer and gave her credit card information over the phone , assuming she was talking to a bank employee , the next thing the customer service representative said made her husband realize she had made a terrible mistake it was after she gave her bank information that the customer service representative said they could sweeten the deal , offering another two weeks onto the cruise if they paid an extra 1200 it was then that yves realized his wife was being scammed saying when they said 1200 bucks i said , 'no , no , no , i shook my head i told my wife , 'hang up , it 's a scam ' sure enough , by the time the couple was able to check online

wangiri phone scam , which involves calling mobile phones and then hanging up after a single ring that s not even the only major phone scam going on right now , as some americans \( myself included \) are receiving voicemail messages from someone claiming to be from microsoft uae and ireland struck by the wangiri phone scam wangiri is japanese for one ring and drop , which is how the wangiri phone scam got its name although the scam seems to have originated in japan , fraudsters are now trying to reach out and touch victims in many other countries one of the latest countries to be hit by the scam is the united arab emirates according to news outlets from the country , many users are reporting missed calls from antarctica , luxembourg and nauru , a tiny island in the pacific ocean others are reporting that they received international calls from south korea and even the u s some irish consumers are also receiving wangiri phone scam calls from numbers originating in chad and liberia thus , experts are advising consumers not to return calls to international numbers they don t recognize \? no matter where they originate from in the uae , consumers are urged to file complaints with their mobile service providers the way the wangiri phone scam works is simple scammers often call a block of phone numbers in sequential order using technology to ring multiple numbers at the same time after a ring or two , they hang up , leaving a missed call on the consumer s phone victims who return the missed call are often charged up to 50 per minute on their phone bills scammers route them back to a phone number which charges premium rates , and then they use technology which prevents victims from disconnecting their callback an automated message forces the victims to remain on the line until it s over after several minutes often the message includes a number of rings before the recorded voice , so it s not immediately clear that the call has been picked up according to telecom authorities in the uae , perpetrators of the wangiri phone scam make money by sharing the revenue earned from the calls with the telecom provider in the country the calls originate from returning an international call that s part of the wangiri phone scam also opens up the victim to a plethora of phishing messages and links to fake contests and lotteries via text messages phishing scams associated with the wangiri phone scam often involve claims that the scammer is calling from the victim s mobile service provider or bank requesting banking information or passwords beware the fake microsoft voicemail and other phone scams if you can t get past the concern that you may have missed an important call , there are some things to keep in mind if someone is legitimately calling you from overseas , they will leave a voicemail message however , leaving a message does not necessarily mean the call is legitimate it may just mean that the call isn t part of the wangiri phone scam here in the u s , i have received voicemails from people claiming to be with your credit card company , although they obviously didn t even know which company i have a credit card with , if any i even received a call from someone who left a voicemail claiming to be from microsoft and that windows was going to stop working if i didn t call the phone number they left plenty of other people are reporting similar voicemail messages , including many who don t even have windows pcs i should clarify that windows shouldn t quit working unless your computer is infected or there is some sort of technical problem which occurs without warning office 365 may stop working if your subscription runs out and you don t renew it , but it seems unlikely that microsoft will call to tell you this they do send emails about it , but we recommend going to the company s website and logging in directly rather than clicking on any links in any email if you receive a call from a company with a questionable message such as this , you should never call back the number they leave on the voicemail instead , you can look up publicly listed customer service numbers for the company on its website and call those numbers instead to find out if the voicemail was legitimate and remember no company will ever call and demand personal information , banking details or passwords not falling victim to scams such as the wangiri phone scam or fake microsoft voicemail is as simple as not returning suspicious calls kilgore , texas \( ketk \) kilgore police are warning about a phone scam in which the

advising citizens to be vigilant as certain phone scams are seeing a recent increase in local activity there are three types of phone scams resurfacing that farmington citizens have reported to the farmington police department recently , according to spokesperson georgette allen we 're trying to encourage people who have loved ones or friends who are not on the internet to make sure the information is getting to them , allen said the three scams deal with law enforcement , the farmington electric utility system and cell phone service providers scammers have been spoofing or imitating the phone numbers of the farmington police department , and calling people to warn them they have a warrant for their arrest the targets of the scam are instructed to pay the caller or they will be arrested , allen said allen added some of the scammers have been using farmington police chief steve hebbe 's name in the calls some farmington detectives have received phone scam calls that spoofed their own work phone numbers the chief is never going to call you and say , 'you got a warrant , and i'm coming to arrest you , ' allen said scammers often request that payments be made by having the victim purchase a prepaid debit , credit or gift card , then call the scammer back and share the information on the card with them , according to allen she said sometimes scammers will even request that the victim stay on the line with them while they purchase a card from a third party any request that involves payment using that method should be a big red flag to potential victims , according to jennie lusk , director of the consumer and family advocacy services division for the new mexico attorney general 's office lusk said nobody running a reputable business would request payment that way the farmington electric utility system has been dealing with a similar issue scammers have been spoofing the city of farmington phone numbers , warning account holders they are behind on payments and demanding money to avoid termination of service , allen said the farmington electric utility system mails disconnection notices to users , and citizens can call 505 599 1353 to check the status of their account , according to a farmington police department press release lusk reminded citizens that they are in control as the scammers try to get people to respond out of impulse or the scammer 's politeness a lot of times , the scammer \( acts like the \) consumer 's best friend , lusk said both allen and lusk warned citizens to avoid sharing any personal information with someone who could be a scammer they also suggested that citizens verify any claim by hanging up the phone and calling the organization or company that the caller claimed to represent lusk said even the ag 's office has received calls from scammers calling residents , warning them their social security number has been deactivated and seeking personal information to reactivate the number farmington police also have received reports of a scam in which the caller claims to be a representative of the recipient 's cell phone service , stating their service will be suspended unless they confirm their personal information , allen said farmington residents can report the scams to the police by calling nonemergency dispatch at 505 334 6622 scams can be reported to the new mexico attorney general 's office at

are being hounded by a fast rising number of spam calls anti spam mobile application truecaller said that its 1 7 million users in malaysia received more than 30 million spam calls this year alone which the app managed to block to give you an example of how fast this problem is growing , since january , we ve seen a 100 increase in spam calls , said truecaller s director of communications kim fai kok truecaller claims to have 250 million users worldwide and has offices in sweden , united states and india there were 10 8 million postpaid mobile phone users and 33 3 million prepaid users in malaysia up to end june this year , according to the malaysian communications and multimedia commission \( mcmc \) kim said truecaller users in malaysia receive an average of six spam calls a month , the second highest in south east asia after indonesia where users get an average of eight users in singapore and thailand receive four respectively , while in vietnam the figure is even lower at two , said kim he said the major driver of spam calls in malaysia are those offering financial services , which account for 67 of the spam calls typically , these are banking product offers or cold calls from credit card companies another major problem that malaysians have to deal with is unsolicited telemarketing calls that make up 13 of total spam calls reported kim said telemarketing calls can further be broken down into promotional calls from companies , surveys being done by analytics firms on behalf of their clients , or new client outreach for services and subscriptions another 9 are calls from insurance companies offering to sell different types of policies , while calls from telecommunications companies selling data and offering promotions make up another 4 the remaining 6 are debt collection , nuisance and scam calls the personal data protection act 2010 regulates and protects the use of personal data collected by companies including banks , hotels and airlines an individual who keeps getting spam calls from any of these companies and feels that their personal data may have been processed in breach of any provision of the act can make a complaint to the personal data protection commissioner however , some spam calls come from firms that the user has not given any personal details to previously others are from scammers such as the macau syndicate the mcmc when contacted advised the public to be vigilant and take precautionary measures whenever receiving calls from unknown numbers these includes lodging a complaint to the commission on the matter , which can be channelled to aduanskmm mcmc gov my in a recent post on the royal malaysia police \( pdrm \) facebook page , police advised smartphone users to install mobile apps that block spam calls and messages statistics from the communica tions and multimedia ministry showed that telecommunications fraud cases involved an estimated rm162 6mil this year alone , with the macau scam being the most common kuala lumpur commercial crime investigation department \( ccid \) chief asst comm mohd luthfi ismail abdullah said while spam call blocking apps could be beneficial , members of the public should not solely depend on them to prevent them from being victims of scams , especially macau scams , as the number of cases has increased significantly recently we must always stay vigilant and suspicious of numbers that could be from scammers the best thing to do is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers avoiding conversation with these scammers is the best way to avoid becoming victims , he said for macau scams , acp mohd luthfi reminded the public that the authorities , such as the police and bank negara , would not call them directly regarding official matters do not believe it if out of the blue , someone claiming to be the police or from other agencies , calls you to inform that you are being investigated or even that your account has been frozen if you receive such suspicious calls and talk to these scammers , call the authorities directly , don t follow the number given by the scammers , he said a macau scam often starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be an officer from a bank , government agency or debt collector the scammer will then claim that the potential victim owes money or has an unpaid fine , often with a very short window of less than an hour to settle the payment or face dire consequences the unsuspecting victims will then be asked to make payments to get them off the hook according to the pdrm facebook post , spam blocking apps typically work by gathering phone numbers that have already been reported while there is no guarantee that such apps can completely stop scammers , smartphone users can reduce the risks , the police said some may be wary about giving permissions to an app such as truecaller after all , the app s privacy policy states that contact information collected and used would include phone numbers as well as attached names , google ids and e mail addresses from one s address book however kim assures that people can use truecaller without sharing their contacts , but to get the best experience we need certain permissions to give you an example , true caller also works as a phone and sms app the value we provide with our dialer is that we put a name to number in your call history \? which is extremely helpful and for the sms feature we automatically help filter out spam messages and keep your inbox clean from being cluttered if you don t want to install another app , some phone makers like samsung include spam call protection in their phones this feature can be turned on from the dialler app open the app , click the three dots on the top right hand corner and then pick settings scroll down and you will see the option caller id and spam protection to turn it on you will have to also agree to share your contacts with the service hiya , a caller id and blocking service

batty , so what can you do about it \? don t answer your phone for real that s the advice from every expert we talked to more specifically if you don t recognize the phone number , you shouldn t pick it up but , why \? the scammers have gotten more and more sophisticated over the last year or two and they 're making money unfortunately , says gavin macomber with first orion first orion is in the business of stopping those pesky and illegal robocalls , including something new called neighborhood spoofing a scammer basically hijacks a number that looks just like yours same area code , same prefix , looks like a business or neighbor down the road , but it 's not it 's somebody trying to get you to answer the phone and then pretend to be somebody they 're not how bad is the problem \? first orion has never been busier we think the number of scam calls next year could approach 50 percent , macomber says nearly half of all calls made to mobile phones next year are expected to be fraudulent well 44 6 percent to be exact it 's already so bad that robocalls are currently the number one complaint to the fcc which has started a robocall strike force to combat the issue the better business bureau gets calls about robocalls every single day but , it s not just the annoyance it 's costing people millions and senior citizens are hit particularly hard they thought it was their bank they thought it was walgreens they thought it was their church and they engage with people that they think that they know , and they send money it just happens an excruciating amount , says lisa jemtrud with the better business bureau so , why does n't your wireless company do something about it \? they actually are verizon already has caller name id , which is an app that can filter out spam calls , and they plan to roll out a voice verification system this fall think of it like twitter when you have a high profile account , like an athlete , or actress or actor , they get that blue checkmark that verifies that it 's an authentic account that is similar to what will happen when a call comes on to your screen you ll have a checkmark or a symbol that will verify that the call originated from that number , says megan dorsch with verizon but right now , the criminals are one step ahead so , what else can you do \? we were n't kidding when we said do n't answer your phone the reason why is because scam artists use technology , and once you pick up the phone , it 's a trigger for them that there 's a live person at the end of that number , and you automatically get registered on all sorts of other lists it 's just going to increase the phone calls , says jemtrud they say something like , 'can you hear me \? ' or , 'is this sandy \? ' and you say , 'yes' , and they capture that to be used for unscrupulous purposes , she explains you can and should file a complaint with the better business bureau , the fcc and the federal trade commission , which runs the do not call list and , if you have n't yet , get on the list see what your phone company provides and check out third party robocall blocking apps and then you wait until

phone for real that s the advice from every expert we talked to more specifically if you don t recognize the phone number , you shouldn t pick it up but , why \? the scammers have gotten more and more sophisticated over the last year or two and they 're making money unfortunately , says gavin macomber with first orion first orion is in the business of stopping those pesky and illegal robocalls , including something new called neighborhood spoofing a scammer basically hijacks a number that looks just like yours same area code , same prefix , looks like a business or neighbor down the road , but it 's not it 's somebody trying to get you to answer the phone and then pretend to be somebody they 're not how bad is the problem \? first orion has never been busier we think the number of scam calls next year could approach 50 percent , macomber says nearly half of all calls made to mobile phones next year are expected to be fraudulent well 44 6 percent to be exact it 's already so bad that robocalls are currently the number one complaint to the fcc which has started a robocall strike force to combat the issue the better business bureau gets calls about robocalls every single day but , it s not just the annoyance it 's costing people millions and senior citizens are hit particularly hard they thought it was their bank they thought it was walgreens they thought it was their church

wireless company do something about it \? they actually are verizon already has caller name id , which is an app that can filter out spam calls , and they plan to roll out a voice verification system

similar to what will happen when a call comes on to your screen you ll have a checkmark or a symbol that will verify that the call originated from that number , says megan dorsch with verizon but right now , the criminals are one step ahead so , what else can you do \? we were n't kidding when we said do n't answer your phone the reason why is because scam artists use technology , and once you pick up the phone , it 's a trigger for them that there 's a live person at the end of that number , and you automatically get registered on all sorts of other lists it 's just going to increase the phone calls , says jemtrud they say something like , 'can you hear me \? ' or , 'is this sandy \? ' and you say , 'yes' , and they capture that to be used for unscrupulous purposes , she explains you can and should file a complaint with the better business bureau , the fcc and the federal trade

spam calls keep coming , but this one leaves a voicemail and it sounds like you should call them back the call , however , could cost you , cbs2 s clark fouraker reported thursday the call comes from a 10 digit number that looks domestic , but beware of area codes 809 , which is in the dominican republic , 284 , the british virgin islands , and 876 , jamaica you re actually dialing internationally , and international rates apply you can pay normal rates if you re calling a friend or family member , but there are also services called premium services , ' said john breyault of the national

and i m sure they re able to do it if they want , midtown resident david pagar added the scams keep happening because the cost for scammers is so low they can spam thousands of phones for next to nothing , and if just one person falls for the trick the scammers often walk away with a profit , fouraker reported because of relationships they have with the phone company or the operator of that premium line get a kickback , breyault said that happens because the domestic and international phone company have paid each other for facilitating the international call by the time you get your bill , you re the only one who hasn t paid i tend to not call back any number that i don t know that haven t left a message just because of scammers , long island resident william maccloud said people trying to charge me on my cellphone the scammers bet on a small charge between 10 30 not catching your attention experts say if you notice a charge on your bill to call your phone company and ask for the charge to be removed if the phone company won t drop the charge , experts say to file a complaint with the federal communications commission most of the time when our phone rings we know who is on the other end it may be a family member or possibly a friend and , if not either of those , likely some business or other contact we were expecting to hear from there are of course robocalls , which none of us like , but those are pretty easy to identify and hang up on but what if you answered and the message was in mandarin and it said to be from the chinese consulate \? if you understand the language you might be a bit more inclined to pay attention , so when the voice says you need to take some steps in order to avoid any kind of trouble with the government , you might listen unfortunately , it 's all a scam like many attacks of this nature , they prey on people being confused or scared specifically , this scam tends to involve the call saying the consulate has an important document that needs to be retrieved , though it could also ask the person to provide information in order to avoid any kind of issue with the consulate whatever the case , before the victim realizes what 's going on , they have often wired a good amount of money to a chinese bank a spokesman for the federal trade commission told nbc news that there is no way to estimate this scam 's scope , but reports have come in from all over the country that led the chinese embassy in the united states to provide an alert on its official website trying to help warn people about the scam , which it released back in april in part , it said we would like to restate that the embassy and consulates general of china would not ask for personal information , deliver parcel pick up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls the embassy would not ask for bank account information why is this one so effective \? of course this scam , like most of its kind , takes advantage of people but part of why it works is that the scammers use spoofing in order to make it appear as though their call is coming from a legitimate number , such as the chinese consulate add the fact that the call and message are in the chinese language , and it 's understandable why some would believe it to be legitimate one woman , who nbc news mentioned , ended up providing personal information including a name , address , age and social security number with those details in hand , the scammers created what looked like a real arrest warrant , and they told the woman they would arrest her and remove her from the united states if she did not wire the money only after sending the money did she look online and find out that the alleged arrest warrant was actually a document used in other scam attempts she attempted to contact police in hong kong , which is where the money went , but they were unable to help however , through a little bit of luck , the transfer was frozen before it was submitted through the destination bank she was able to recover the 95 , 000 she would have lost , save for the 80 wire fee not everyone is as fortunate , so here 's how to not become a victim this specific scam targets people in the chinese community , and in fact , the aarp reported in january that a great majority of asian americans and pacific islanders age 50 and older said their families had been targets of fraud along those lines , one third of all victims lost an average of 15 , 000 but while this scam targets a certain community , in truth the methods to avoid it and others are very similar it is important to understand that legitimate organizations , and especially governments , do not ask for sensitive information over the phone , nor would they require you wire money in order to settle an issue if you do receive one of the calls , it is a good idea to take a moment and do some research into it if it is fake , chances are it will not take long to discover what to do if you 've been scammed when you realize you 've been scammed out of money , there 's no time to waste contact the bank you used and see if it can stop the transaction if you 've purchased gift cards another favorite of scammers contact the company that issues the cards to see what they can do you should also contact law enforcement local police or even the fbi if only

targeted by mysterious calls from international numbers as part of an elaborate scam that has been running over the last few years dubbed the wangiri scam , which translates from the japanese to one ring and cut , it involves con artists leaving missed calls on the user 's phone from an unknown international number should the user call back , they are charged premium rates of up to 50 a minute this is not the first time such scam hit new zealanders as recently as february last year , there were reports of similar scams the wangiri call is when a scammer will call from a premium number and purposely hang up after one or two rings , she told the herald because calls are billed typically from the time of answer , these attempts have no cost to the attacker they will typically target mobile phones , as there is a higher likelihood that a mobile phone has caller id display ''the goal for the attacker is to entice victims to call back the number upon seeing a missed call the perpetrators make money by collecting revenue on these calls via the premium rates issued by the overseas telecommunications provider , or by scamming victims on the return calls arauzo draws a distinction between wangiri ruse and the increasingly common robo dialler scams , which are also present in new zealand the auto dialler system enables the caller to systematically auto dial a list of numbers if it picks up human activity on the other end it can either connect you to a person , or if there is n't someone available , it will be silent and then hang up while arauzo said spark customers do n't appear to be reporting a surge of this type of scam activity , she did say the telco is always vigilant in keeping an eye on these issues spark plays an active role in limiting the number of scam calls out there when a scammer uses one number continuously , we identify and block that number the same also applies vodafone , whose spokesperson elissa downey says they 're also keeping an eye on scam activity unfortunately the 'wangiri' scam hits our shores from time to time , but we are not seeing a surge in this type of scam at the moment , said downey our best advice is to avoid answering those numbers or any number you do n't recognise or expect a call from and let the call go to voicemail that way you can check if the message is from someone you were expecting or actually want to hear from if the caller does not leave a message , ignore it and do n't call the number back beyond the missed call variation of the wangiri scam , downey also recommends keeping an eye out for other scams another one to watch out for is an unsolicited call and someone starts engaging with you , downey told the herald typically , with this type of scam they are calling from overseas but sometimes they might spoof a new zealand number , fixed or mobile , and they either try to sell you something or ask you for money downey recommends users treat the interactions exactly the same as they would an unsolicited email simply hang up and do n't engage , she said it is really important to always be on your guard with callers you do n't know \? if something seems a bit off or too good to be true , it usually is she also advises mobile users to notify their telco immediately if they have received a strange call or large charge we work with the wider telco industry to block certain numbers from connecting through to customers phones if we know they are linked to a scam downey finally recommends that users check the consumer protection website if they 're in any

you just received a phone call that appears to be from your own number \? if so , it s likely a spoofed call that a scammer has set up in order to get you to answer their phone scam i can personally attest to this clever trick i just recently got a call from my cell phone that claimed to be from my own number once i answered , i heard a message in an automated male voice , stating apart from the weird phrasing \( i m not sure what compromised by at t is supposed to mean \) , there are a few ways to tell that this is a scam \? first , robocalls aren t a common way for brands to contact their customers \? next , the call never personally identifies whose account they re calling about , shifting the burden of identification to the listener \? this allows the scammer to record a one size fits all message \? finally , it asks for four social security digits \? personal information that a scammer often fishes for so why is this such a clever phone scam \? because it addresses the biggest challenge a phone scammer faces how to get a victim to pick up the phone in the first place personally , i never answer my phone if i don t recognize the number , and this attitude is growing among a younger generation , too when texting , emailing , or even facebook messaging are the go to options , why bother answering an unknown caller \? because , this scam hopes , you re so confused by seeing your own number that you answer just to find out what s going on then , the scam offers an easy explanation the automated voice claims to be from your own phone carrier i do indeed use at t \? this scam potentially targets only at t customers , as this is still a huge base granted , it doesn t make a lot of sense that a phone carrier would call from its clients numbers rather than their own , but it only has to make a moment of sense to trick a few people into giving up their social security digits if you want to avoid fielding scam calls all day , you have a few options if you don t pick up the phone when you don t recognize the number , you ll avoid this phone scam and any like it the downside \? sometimes you ll miss a legitimate call join the do not call list the federally run do not call list is able to keep some \? but far from all \? robocalls away from your number since scammers aren t exactly concerned with staying legal , they ll likely keep calling , but you ll see a

accounts some people keep all their savings on their phone and fraudsters are trying to hack into them to steal the money sammy wanaina received a text message on sunday asking him to provide the secret personal code so that his sim card could be swapped he was confused , he had not asked for a new card and just moments earlier he had terminated a call that he now realised must have been from a fraudster who had posed as a customer services adviser from the phone company it was a brief call and i did not give any of my details , mr wanaina told the bbc he immediately contacted safaricom , his mobile provider , to report that he suspected that there was an ongoing attempted fraud on his number despite not giving out his details and reporting the fraud to safaricom he completely lost access to his number and only getting back control after three days he tweeted that the whole experience had scared him mr wanaina says safaricom contacted him after his complaint and issued him with a new sim card as a precaution without giving further details about how he lost access to his number the company tweeted him to say it was committed to safeguarding customer information and that we will follow up this matter to its conclusion his story prompted others to share their experiences many of whom had lost money in the scam politician stanley wanjiku revealed that he had been trapped by the fraudsters , losing 18 000 \( 14 , 000 \) he told the daily nation newspaper that his trouble started after he received a notification that he could not access his mobile wallet and had to call a certain number to reset it which he did he later learned that his pin number has been replaced and a new one regenerated , so he could not get access to his money the paper did not say which service he had his account i do not know how my mobile money pin was regenerated and issued to strangers i am at a loss how they identified themselves , mr wanjiku said , adding that a bank account not linked to his mobile phone was also hacked \? why the mobile wallet failed in south africa people tend to have several sim cards from different companies as they have different coverage and deals this means sim cards do get damaged , so it 's not unusual for customers to want to replace them kenya has the highest number of users of mobile money in the world , a major reason why the recent sim card fraud has caused such public alarm almost half of its 47 million population use the dominant m pesa platform to pay for services and conduct businesses through partnerships , phone companies have also managed to integrate mobile money services with banks , allowing customers to seamlessly move money back and forth william makatiani , from the cyber security consulting firm serianu , told the daily nation that the scam to hack into mobile phones is becoming more common sim swapping has become a big problem especially in nigeria since 2016 it started picking up in kenya in the last half of last year , he was quoted as saying how to protect yourself it is not clear how exactly the scam is working , but this week the communication authority of kenya , the body that regulates the mobile phone industry , told users to be on their guard \? delete requests for financial information or passwords safaricom also urged customers to safeguard their passwords , dates of birth and national identity numbers it also said that subscribers should be aware of its official customer care number so as not to be duped by those trying to get access their account cabel sasser narrowly avoided having his bank account emptied last week by a swindler running an atm card scam , an escape from a financial nightmare that he recounted in a string of tweets the attempted fraud was carried out by an unknown male phone caller who had sasser 's social security number and appeared to be calling from the security department at wells fargo , the bank where sasser has an account the attack marked a more sophisticated variation on older scams and represents a cautionary tale for millions of american consumers the results of a consumer poll on phone scams and spam issued in april 2018 by truecaller , a mobile app that helps block unwanted calls , showed that an estimated 1 of every 10 u s adults had been victimized by a phone scam during the preceding 12 months , with an average loss of 357 per victim unfortunately , phishing scams like these are all too common , and the fraudsters can be convincing , said sarah grano , a spokesperson for the american bankers association the best thing to do is trust your gut and hang up if a call seems suspicious sasser , a co founder of panic , a software company and video game producer based in portland , oregon , said he was not suspicious at first his cellphone 's caller identification system showed the call apparently came from the 800 number listed on the back of his wells fargo atm card more season 6 of fortnite is here everything you need to know more amazon 4 star , a general merchandise store featuring its top rated products , to open in nyc more what you need to know about google 's personalized ads and how to turn them off a male caller identified himself as a fraud department agent and said the card had just been used for purchases at a target store in minnesota , more than 1 , 500 miles away from sasser 's home it was a very smooth , very authentic sounding call , sasser said in a telephone interview i 've had this happen so many times that i did n't even flinch at the fact that , great , another card got used someplace where it should n't be used answering questions from the caller , sasser said he had the card in his possession the caller had him verify the card 's security code then , the man read some disclosures related to obtaining a replacement atm card the procedure , familiar from previous security calls , helped with the believability , sasser said next , the man asked him to key in a different personal identification code for the new card via his cellphone that raised a red flag there were no computer prompts or anything i was just literally pushing numbers on my phone that he 's just hearing on the other end , sasser said i was starting to get a little nervous finally , the man asked him to enter his current pin number into the phone that was the moment that pushed me over the edge \? something is definitely not right here , sasser said i asked him point blank , 'do n't you know my pin number you 're the bank \? ' the man said he could n't see the number and then tried to allay suspicion by reading the last four digits of sasser 's social security number sasser said the numbers were correct , but something was very wrong now all but certain he was being scammed , sasser nonetheless said he reflexively shied away from being rude somehow , i found the courage to push through that hesitation , said sasser i said , 'i'm sorry something about this seems weird i'm just going to call the number on the back of my card the man sounded kind of defeated as the call ended sasser said but a real wells fargo representative was anything but crestfallen when sasser called the bank 's security office i spoke to a guy who was incredibly happy that i had stopped when i did , because many people do n't and lose money , said sasser he definitely said 'there had been no attempted fraud on your card , and that whole story had been totally made up ' such scams are anything but uncommon in all , 77 , 999 people who filed complaints with the federal do not call registry in 2017 reported imposter frauds from live callers , according to the federal trade commission an additional 179 , 925 complaints reported similar frauds from recorded robocalls the truecaller poll from april found that 18 percent of the respondents who said they had received scam calls during the preceding 12 month period cited bank problems , including calls that sought sensitive information about accounts in many cases , the scammers have already gathered information about potential victims , said lauren saunders , the associate director of the national consumer law center social security numbers can be bought in bulk on the dark web and other sites phone numbers for security departments at a bank , or other companies , can be spoofed so they appear on caller id systems caller id can be programmed to say whatever someone wants it to say , said amy nofziger , an aarp expert on consumer frauds wells fargo declined to comment on the phishing call reported by sasser however , the san francisco based bank said scams are becoming more commonplace \? banks wo n't ask for pin codes , so be suspicious of a call from anyone who does , said nofziger and do n't shy away from confronting a suspected scam caller it is not rude to take control of the situation and take control of your financial security , she said \? if you receive a phone call seeking information or access to an account , hang up and contact the financial company by using the number on your atm card or on the firm 's website , wells fargo said \? do n't provide your account information or social security number to anyone who contacts you by phone or online , the american bankers association said use a combination of letters and numbers for passwords , and change them frequently reflecting on the incident , sasser said the scam was more sophisticated than anything he 'd previously encountered that 's one of the reasons he shared the details it tells me that the thieves are getting smarter , which means that we have to be getting smarter , he said cold spring a recent phone scam is circulating in cold spring and it 's fooling people into thinking they 're talking to a local person cold spring police chief jason blum says they 've received several calls last month and this month about an irs phone scam many of the calls are appearing as local numbers they the scammers are using computerized dialers so they can make it look like a local phone number and we 've had some come up as local businesses on the caller id so people actually think they are talking to someone that they may or should know which is not the case , they 're disguising their phone numbers which make it difficult for us to track anything down on our end blum says the scam is like many others that claim you either owe money to the irs or need to bail someone out of jail the big one right now is you have back taxes from the irs and local law enforcement have a warrant out for your arrest if you do n't give us the money so we 're just trying to inform people about what 's going on a lot of these scams are happening and people are still spending money on them many of the scammers tell people they need to mail gift cards out of state to cover their back taxes or bail someone out of jail police would like to remind you that the irs or any law enforcement agency will never accept gift cards as payment the best way to protect yourself is to ask questions if you suspect it 's a scam call the police it may be summer , but the bad guys aren t taking a vacation the acting inspector general of social security , gale stallworth stone , has issued a warning about an ongoing phone scam from thieves pretending to be from the social security administration \( ssa \) as part of the con , scammers try to convince you to give up personal information , like social security numbers and bank account numbers , over the phone in another case , a caller claims to be from ssa headquarters and asks you to confirm personal information , such as an ssn , new medicare number , address , and date of birth many of these calls are robocalls or automated calls in one robocall version of the scam , an automated recording declares that your social security number \( ssn \) has been suspended for suspicion of illegal activity , and advises to contact a specific phone number immediately the robocall or caller may also warn that if you don t call back , your assets or benefits will be frozen until your alleged issue is resolved robocalls from scammers pretending to be from government agencies , like the internal revenue service \( irs \) , continue to be problematic they are cheap and easy and allows thieves to reach the largest number of victims possible you may recall that a robocall strike force was established in 2016 to develop solutions to prevent , detect , and filter unwanted robocalls the task force was made up of communications companies including cell and landline service providers , phone manufacturers , operating system \( os \) developers and the federal communications commission \( fcc \) members included such communications leaders as apple , bandwidth , comcast , google , microsoft , sprint , t mobile , and verizon however , two years later , there doesn t seem to be any real progress made to stop robocalls according to an fcc spokesperson , this industry led effort produced two detailed reports to the commission and which were instrumental in laying the groundwork for both on going fcc policy making efforts and industry technological work fcc work that used the strike force s recommendations includes work to reduce robocalls to reassigned numbers , the new fcc rules allowing phone companies to proactively block calls that are likely to be fraudulent , and fcc work to encourage implementation of call authentication the commission continues to consult with a wide variety of stakeholders though there are no current plans to formally reconvene this group rather , the strike force s reports served their purpose by spurring and framing on going commission and industry action to help consumer avoid illegal robocalls the fcc has issued some tips for dealing with robocalls they include \? if you answer the phone and the caller or a recording asks you to hit a button to stop getting the calls , you should just hang up scammers often use this trick to identify potential targets \? do not respond to any questions , especially those that can be answered with yes \( you can find out more about the dangers of saying yes to robocalls here \) \? talk to your phone company about call blocking tools they may have and check into apps that you can download to your mobile device to block unwanted calls \? if you use robocall blocking technology already , it often helps to let that company know which numbers are producing unwanted calls so they can help block those calls for you and others \? to block telemarketing calls , register your number on the do not call list in the meantime , robocalls and phone calls made by scammers and thieves continue to be problematic it s especially confusing because the irs has repeatedly advised taxpayers that they will not reach out by phone to resolve taxpayer issues however , ssa employees do occasionally reach out by telephone for customer service purposes further , the ssa says that in a few limited special situations which are usually already known to the citizen , an ssa employee may confirm personal information over the phone the acting inspector general of social security , gale stallworth stone , warns folks to be cautious , and to avoid providing information such as your ssn or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are certain of who is receiving it be aware of suspicious calls from unknown sources , and when in doubt , contact the official entity to verify the legitimacy of the call , stone said the ssa advises that if you receive a suspicious call from someone alleging to be from ssa , report that information to the oig at 1 800 269 0271 or online i would go a step further when in doubt , assume it s a scam if you re not sure whether a call is legitimate , hang up and call back using an official number \( do n't just use the caller id number on your phone since those can be spoofed \) to reach irs , call 1 800 829 1040 to contact social security , call 1 800 772 1213 if you know that it s a scam , do n't engage with scammers or thieves , even if you want to tell them that you know it 's a scam , or you think that you can best them just hang up the irs says that phone scams are still a major threat to taxpayers in early 2018 , phone scams held down the top spot on the irs dirty dozen list of tax scams , and the treasury inspector general for tax administration \( tigta \) reported they have become aware of over 12 , 716 victims who have collectively paid over 63 million as a result of phone scams since october 2013 remember that the irs will never \? call to demand immediate payment over the phone , nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill \? threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying \? demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe \? require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes , such as a prepaid debit card , gift card or wire transfer \? ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone for more tips on protecting yourself from identity theft related tax fraud , click here the phone call in early june purporting to be from chinese authorities was , in a word , alarming the massachusetts woman who answered it learned she may have been the victim of identity theft but after almost a week of corresponding and sharing personal information over the phone in an effort to find how her identity had apparently been stolen things went very wrong very quickly it turned from trying to be helpful , as you potentially are a victim of identity theft in china , to there s an international arrest warrant out for your arrest , said jeremy warnick , director of communications and media relations for the cambridge police department the woman , whom police did not identify , ended up wiring 95 , 000 to a bank in hong kong to avoid what she thought would be her arrest and removal from the u s , according to warnick only after did she realize she had fallen victim to a phone scam a popular version of the ruse , which appears to have taken off earlier this year , involves a robocall message in mandarin that identifies itself as the chinese consulate and tells the person who picks up that there s an important document to retrieve it may also direct recipients of the call to provide information to avoid getting into trouble with the consulate , according to the federal trade commission asked about the extent of the chinese consulate scam , ftc spokesman frank dorman said in an email that there s no way to estimate the scope of any kind of fraud but reports of it have come in from across the country , from new york to massachusetts to california , prompting the chinese embassy in the u s to issue an alert on its official website we would like to restate that the embassy and consulates general of china would not ask for personal information , deliver parcel pick up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls , read the advisory , dated april 19 the embassy would not ask for bank account information a big part of the scam s success involves what s known as spoofing , a process in which scam artists make it appear as if a call is originating from a legitimate phone number , like that of the chinese consulate around a half year ago , legislation sponsored by u s rep grace meng , d n y , was signed into law as part of the omnibus spending bill that makes such spoofing attempts from abroad a criminal act meng , whose district covers a swath of the new york city borough of queens , home to a large asian american population , called the law a first step in penalizing overseas con artists who try to scam people in the u s through spoofing the bill became law in march , right around the time her office began fielding reports about the chinese consulate scam , which appeared mostly to be targeting people with chinese sounding surnames these folks , they probably tend to trust the chinese consulate , they re speaking in their language , meng said it s easier , i think , to scam people when they re talking in their own language meng s office said they ve received a few dozen reports from constituents about the chinese consulate scam , including one who said they lost 1 5 million the congresswoman added that , for this particular scam , it appears that the number of phone calls in her district has dropped since springtime , when there was an onslaught of them the new york police department did not respond to requests for comment about the scam it s unclear what effect the anti spoofing bill has had so far on deterring or prosecuting scam artists overseas since it was signed into law apart from imposing criminal penalties , the legislation requires the federal communications commission , together with the ftc , to regularly update materials to help consumers identify and protect themselves from caller id scams meng also sent a letter to the ftc in may , calling for its online complaint assistant to be made available in chinese \( the website has only a spanish language option \) dorman , the ftc spokesperson , said the agency doesn t comment on correspondences it receives , but did reference online ftc literature in chinese that informs consumers specifically about the consulate scam , scams against immigrants and wiring money overseas back in cambridge , authorities hadn t seen too many instances of scammers pretending to be the chinese government , said warnick , the cambridge police department spokesperson the woman targeted in june had corresponded with the fraudsters for around a week through voice and text , according to warnick they even asked her to get a temporary cell phone from which she could make international calls over the week and using that phone , the scammers got the cambridge woman to divulge more and more personal information , including her name , address , age and social security number , warnick said they then plugged those details into what looked like a legitimate arrest warrant in simplified chinese characters , which warnick said they texted to her they told the woman they were in cambridge and that if she didn t proceed with a money transfer , they would arrest her and kick her out of the u s , according to warnick after wiring the money , the woman searched online and found that her purported international arrest warrant was a document used in other scam attempts across the country she tried contacting police in hong kong , where she had transferred the money , but they weren t able to help , according to warnick then the woman called the cambridge police department she was frankly so embarrassed she didn t even notify family or friends that she was a victim , warnick said , adding that the woman was not elderly , an age group that often falls prey to such scams fortunately , she had at a few things going in her favor one was that the transfer took place over the weekend , when banks tend to be closed another was that a cambridge police department detective just happened to be friends with an irs agent stationed in hong kong , warnick said the detective notified the irs official about the transfer and its size , according to warnick that particular agent worked with local police to freeze the transfer before ultimately it was successfully submitted through the destination bank , warnick added in the end , the woman got back her 95 , 000 , except for the 80 wire fee the case has since been handed over to the fbi , warnick said not every victim is as lucky warnick said that in cambridge , a city across the charles river from boston with 110 , 000 residents , police receive an average of 10 to 15 reported telephone internet scams each week we believe that the magnitude of it is much higher because a lot of these aren t reported , warnick added , citing such reasons as embarrassment a report released in january by aarp , a nonprofit advocacy group for the aging , found that an overwhelming majority of asian americans and pacific islanders age 50 and older said they or their families have been targets of fraud , while a third of all victims lost on average 15 , 000 meng said educating residents is most important in preventing people from becoming victims of scams , which are not just limited to impostors pretending to call from the chinese consulate one of the more prevalent schemes includes thieves impersonating internal revenue service personnel who disguise their phone numbers to make it seem like they re calling from the irs they then demand immediate payment for unpaid taxes , according to meng s office warnick said the non emergency number of the cambridge police department has even been spoofed so called blessing schemes have also been used to prey on members of the chinese community , especially the elderly fraudsters tell their victims that a death curse has been placed on them and that the only way to remove it is by forking over cash and jewelry warnick , whose police department has nearly 280 officers who speak 14 languages , said they hold regular seminars for seniors in particular to help them understand the latest trends in scams and what to do to protect themselves but he added that it can be challenging trying to reach residents for whom english is a second language there is somewhat of an intimidation factor in terms of contacting local police and working with local police , especially during these times of immigration concerns , warnick said but certainly we as a department make ourselves available to go wherever people feel like they need support , whether it s a community meeting , or with a small group , in a home , whatever it may be , we ve done all of the above , he said the social security administration issued a warning today about an ongoing office of the inspector general \( oig \) impersonation scheme the scheme echoes a pattern where thieves pretend to be from government agencies , like those involving scammers posing as callers from the internal revenue service \( irs \) in the most recent scam , folks are reporting suspicious phone calls allegedly from the oig specifically , the caller identifies as gale stone and states the person s social security number \( ssn \) is at risk of being deactivated or deleted the scammers are hoping that name sounds familiar the acting inspector general of social security is gale stallworth stone it 's also worth noting that social security numbers do n't have an expiration date , and you do n't have to re activate or confirm them for them to be valid while variations on the scam exist , typically the caller advises the victim to call a particular phone number to resolve the issue do not call the number or engage with the scammer \( even if you think you can get the better of them \) the better tack is just to hang up you can also report the information to the oig at 1 800 269 0271 or online above all , the real inspector general stone urges you to be cautious and to avoid providing information such as your ssn or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are sure who is asking the same rule applies to those alleged irs phone calls when in doubt , assume it s a scam if you re not sure whether a call is legitimate , hang up and call back using an official number \( do n't just use the caller id number on your phone since those can be spoofed \) to reach irs , call 1 800 829 1040 to contact social security , call 1 800 772 1213 the irs says that phone scams are still a major threat to taxpayers in early 2018 , phone scams held down the top spot on the irs dirty dozen list of tax

arrest you i sat down with a former assistant attorney general of louisiana who wants to let the elderly know of this scam col jeron j la fargue , retired attorney at law , says , the main thing is unfortunately there are people in the world who will try to take advantage of senior citizens this is the voicemail that elderly people in the area are receiving trying to extort money from them this is a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in the next 24 working hours and once again , if it expires , you will be taken under custody by the local cops an elderly person who does not have my background would think that it 's true that someone is going to come knock on their door , police and take them into custody , la fargue says the better business bureau says the number the scammers are calling from is not local jenn love , with the better business bureau of acadiana , says , it 's funny because they 'll call from a non local number and they 'll say the local cops are coming but they wo n't say what parish or what city they 're even living in it 's just very generic that the local cops are coming i'm not sure that they could arrest them because they 're out of the country but the main thing is for people to understand that it is a scam , explains la fargue some people think just because they have your name and they know their phone number that they have all this information , they 'll volunteer it thinking they already have it and that 's not the case do n't give out any of your personal information , love adds in order to avoid this threatening phone scam , here are some suggestions from the better business bureau \? none do n't give out any personal information , including your name , address , or especially your banking information \? none do n't trust your caller id scammers now have the technology to take the caller id and distort it to any number \? none government agencies will not call you they will send you a letter if they need to contact you i was traveling recently when i got a phone call letting me know that the internal revenue service apparently wants to throw me in jail if there is one thing you can hear while you 're on the road that is worse than the thump of a flat tire or the clatter of an engine breakdown it 's the voice of an irs agent who is insisting you 're going to do hard time and i was on the move , so you could say that from the moment i answered the call i was on the lam i was fleeing the law since i was traveling on an interstate , it was sort of a high speed getaway great , not only did i need to make sure i was keeping to the speed limit in case i encountered a state trooper , now i had to keep an eye out for federal agents in official looking cars accompanied by anyone who looked like an irs accountant there 's the one ! that 's the guy whose numbers were obscured by coffee stains on his tax return in all honesty , i'm not sure if spilled java during late night and last minute tax filing work was included in my law breaking when the call came in i was driving in a rainstorm in a hands free telephone state , so i listened to it for only a few seconds through the vehicle 's audio hookup before hanging up on what appeared to be the recorded voice of a woman who seemed to be linguistically challenged in english i understood what she said still , some of the grammar seemed to be a little bit off for someone chosen by the irs to communicate with the public she said that i had four serious infractions and , essentially , the irs was tracking me down she did n't say what those infractions were , but the tone was accusatory in fact , she told me that if i did n't call the irs back i would be arrested by the local cops it was then that i pressed the hang up button on my suv 's dashboard radio i was approaching a tractor trailer better that i be cuffed in the privacy of my home than be cut off by a truck driver who could n't see me in his spray after ending the call , however , i was n't very worried the woman 's charges seemed too unbelievable i could n't see how i could break four laws on one tax form i do n't earn that much i did n't even itemize i filed the short form i did n't have room on one piece of paper \? filling out both the front and back \? to be too much of a criminal , even by accident besides , i 've read a lot in the last few years about irs phone scams callers seek personal information or demand payments of unpaid taxes over the phone by using debit cards the callers refuse to entertain questions about the required payments or incorrectly insist that the irs allows no appeal of the alleged tax code violations if a scamming victim protests , the callers threaten to bring in local law enforcement but , i'm guessing real irs agents would n't call those officers cops and , later i went online to the irs website and saw that these scams occur throughout the country i know this to be a fact because a second call from the same number came in later in my drive and i was in a different state this time i listened to it the whole way through it 's interesting what a guy will do for entertainment on a long drive the call sounded even more like a scam when i heard it in its entirety i'm writing about it only as a warning to people who might fall victim to such a call , handing

ofcanz \) arm of the police , who gives instructions on how to allow them access to the victim 's device whether the scammer purports to be from the department of immigration or the chinese embassy or one of dozens and dozens of stories that are used , each story is designed to create anxiety for the person who answers the phone , mr rapira davies said he said ofcanz had been renamed and was no longer used within the police mr rapira davies said often older and more vulnerable members of the community were the ones who were targeted we have certainly tried to do a lot of work to try and advise the public of scams , he said mr rapira davies said anyone who was a victim of a scam , whether through the phone or online , should immediately report the scam to their bank and the police

common phone scam nearly costs a sunset hills couple thousands of dollars but a quick thinking local courier service stopped the crime from happening nick kirkou , owner of ontime express courier and delivery said he had a feeling , that the monday morning call his dispatcher took from a guy about a package delivery didn t sound right when we looked up the address it comes up in the bronx at an apartment building and it was supposed to be going to a business kirkou explained he said the man on the phone was calling from a canadian area code the dispatcher followed orders and had a driver pick up the package from an address in sunset hills which was then to be delivered to fedex but the company s suspicion got them to alert police i went home and it was bothering me , kirkou went on to

for your neighbors and your family , said kirkou , as a business , we have that moral obligation too and we are in the business to make money but that s not the way we want to earn it police said that

threatens to disconnect their service if they do n't get paid jea said the scammers call local businesses and residents they pose as jea and say if you fail to pay them , they will cut off your service if you receive this call , jea said you should hang up and then call 904 665 6000 to report it new york \( cbsnewyork \) \? the spam calls keep coming , but this one leaves a voicemail and it sounds like you should call them back the call , however , could cost you , cbs2 s clark fouraker reported thursday the call comes from a 10 digit number that looks domestic , but beware of area codes 809 , which is in the dominican republic , 284 , the british virgin islands , and 876 , jamaica you re actually dialing internationally , and international rates apply you can pay normal rates if you re calling a friend or family member , but there are also services called premium services , ' said john breyault of the national consumers league those services could be lines dedicated to gambling or psychic readings a new email warning says they leave a message that says , hey this is karen sorry i missed you get back to us quickly i have something important to tell you it s very sad , and it s so many scams , said hope chasin of the east village it s outrageous , of course , and at t or verizon should block those calls and i m sure they re able to do it if they want , midtown resident david pagar added the scams keep happening because the cost for scammers is so low they can spam thousands of phones for next to nothing , and if just one person falls for the trick the scammers often walk away with a profit , fouraker reported because of relationships they have with the phone company or the operator of that premium line get a kickback , breyault said that happens because the domestic and international phone company have paid each other for facilitating the international call by the time you get your bill , you re the only one who hasn t paid i tend to not call back any number that i don t know that haven t left a message just because of scammers , long island resident william maccloud said people trying to charge me on my cellphone the scammers bet on a small charge between 10 30 not catching your attention experts say if you notice a charge on your bill to call your phone company and ask for the charge to be removed if the phone company won t drop the charge , experts say to file a complaint with the federal communications commission most of the time when our phone rings we know who is on the other end it may be a family member or possibly a friend and , if not either of those , likely some business or other contact we were expecting to hear from there are of course robocalls , which none of us like , but those are pretty easy to identify and hang up on but what if you answered and the message was in mandarin and it said to be from the chinese consulate \? if you understand the language you might be a bit more inclined to pay attention , so when the voice says you need to take some steps in order to avoid any kind of trouble with the government , you might listen unfortunately , it 's all a scam like many attacks of this nature , they prey on people being confused or scared specifically , this scam tends to involve the call saying the consulate has an important document that needs to be retrieved , though it could also ask the person to provide information in order to avoid any kind of issue with the consulate whatever the case , before the victim realizes what 's going on , they have often wired a good amount of money to a chinese bank a spokesman for the federal trade commission told nbc news that there is no way to estimate this scam 's scope , but reports have come in from all over the country that led the chinese embassy in the united states to provide an alert on its official website trying to help warn people about the scam , which it released back in april in part , it said we would like to restate that the embassy and consulates general of china would not ask for personal information , deliver parcel pick up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls the embassy would not ask for bank account information why is this one so effective \? of course this scam , like most of its kind , takes advantage of people but part of why it works is that the scammers use spoofing in order to make it appear as though their call is coming from a legitimate number , such as the chinese consulate add the fact that the call and message are in the chinese language , and it 's understandable why some would believe it to be legitimate one woman , who nbc news mentioned , ended up providing personal information including a name , address , age and social security number with those details in hand , the scammers created what looked like a real arrest warrant , and they told the woman they would arrest her and remove her from the united states if she did not wire the money only after sending the money did she look online and find out that the alleged arrest warrant was actually a document used in other scam attempts she attempted to contact police in hong kong , which is where the money went , but they were unable to help however , through a little bit of luck , the transfer was frozen before it was submitted through the destination bank she was able to recover the 95 , 000 she would have lost , save for the 80 wire fee not everyone is as fortunate , so here 's how to not become a victim this specific scam targets people in the chinese community , and in fact , the aarp reported in january that a great majority of asian americans and pacific islanders age 50 and older said their families had been targets of fraud along those lines , one third of all victims lost an average of 15 , 000 but while this scam targets a certain community , in truth the methods to avoid it and others are very similar it is important to understand that legitimate organizations , and especially governments , do not ask for sensitive information over the phone , nor would they require you wire money in order to settle an issue if you do receive one of the calls , it is a good idea to take a moment and do some research into it if it is fake , chances are it will not take long to discover what to do if you 've been scammed when you realize you 've been scammed out of money , there 's no time to waste contact the bank you used and see if it can stop the transaction if you 've purchased gift cards another favorite of scammers contact the company that issues the cards to see what they can do you should also contact law enforcement local police or even the fbi if only to file a report that you might need later to make a claim more ways to stop phone call scams in their

running over the last few years dubbed the wangiri scam , which translates from the japanese to one ring and cut , it involves con artists leaving missed calls on the user 's phone from an unknown international number should the user call back , they are charged premium rates of up to 50 a minute this is not the first time such scam hit new zealanders as recently as february last year , there were reports of similar scams the wangiri call is when a scammer will call from a premium number and purposely hang up after one or two rings , she told the herald because calls are billed typically from the time of answer , these attempts have no cost to the attacker they will typically target mobile phones , as there is a higher likelihood that a mobile phone has caller id display ''the goal for the attacker is to entice victims to call back the number upon seeing a missed call the perpetrators make money by collecting revenue on these calls via the premium rates issued by the overseas telecommunications provider , or by scamming victims on the return calls arauzo draws a distinction between wangiri ruse and the increasingly common robo dialler scams , which are also present in new zealand the auto dialler system enables the caller to systematically auto dial a list of numbers if it picks up human activity on the other end it can either connect you to a person , or if there is n't someone available , it will be silent and then hang up while arauzo said spark customers do n't appear to be reporting a surge of this type of scam activity , she did say the telco is always vigilant in keeping an eye on these issues spark plays an active role in limiting the number of scam calls out there when a scammer uses one number continuously , we identify and block that number the same also applies vodafone , whose spokesperson elissa downey says they 're also keeping an eye on scam activity unfortunately the 'wangiri' scam hits our shores from time to time , but we are not seeing a surge in this type of scam at the moment , said downey our best advice is to avoid answering those numbers or any number you do n't recognise or expect a call from and let the call go to voicemail that way you can check if the message is from someone you were expecting or actually want to hear from if the caller does not leave a message , ignore it and do n't call the number back beyond the missed call variation of the wangiri scam , downey also recommends keeping an eye out for other scams another one to watch out for is an unsolicited call and someone starts engaging with you , downey told the herald typically , with this type of scam they are calling from overseas but sometimes they might spoof a new zealand number , fixed or mobile , and they either try to sell you something or ask you for money downey recommends users treat the interactions exactly the same as they would an unsolicited email simply hang up and do n't engage , she said it is really important to always be on your guard with callers you do n't know \? if something seems a bit off or too good to be true , it usually is she also advises mobile users to notify their telco immediately if they have received a strange call or large charge we work with the wider telco industry to block certain numbers from connecting through to customers phones if we know they are linked to a scam downey finally

live in a part of the country that has a large chinese immigrant population , you may have recently received a robocall in mandarin \? or even several of them the calls seem to be blanketing certain phone exchanges without regard to the national origin of the recipients presumably , this is how the new york police department ended up on the call list nypd officer donald mccaffrey , who works in the queens grand larceny division , is investigating the calls in new york city he has also been receiving them on a daily basis i get them also , in the nypd building , mccaffrey says i have an nypd department cellphone and i get them on the cellphones , also it is out of control non mandarin speakers may find the robocalls baffling \? or annoying \? and just hang up but some chinese immigrants who have followed the robocall 's prompts have found themselves sucked into an international phone scam the calls first came to mccaffrey 's attention in december 2017 , when a 65 year old chinese woman complained to the nypd that she had been scammed out of 1 3 million she called to report that someone from the chinese consulate called and said she needs to call the beijing police department because she 's being investigated for financial crimes over in china , mccaffrey says the robocall messages are usually some variation on that theme this is the consulate we have an important document that needs to be picked up it may affect your status in the u s press a button to speak with a specialist \? and that is when a connection is made to a live scammer that person then tries to execute what is known as a parcel scam \? pretending to be from a courier company and claiming that a package addressed to the victim is connected to a criminal case the phone call is then transferred to a fake police officer who says that it 's a money laundering investigation and that if the victim transfers money to a hong kong bank account , the police will resolve the case so far , the nypd has received 30 complaints from people who have lost money to this robocall scam mccaffrey estimates 3 million has been stolen from the city 's residents the nypd and security experts who have looked into these calls say they think the calls are originating in mainland china the consulate general of the people 's republic of china in new york says it has been been getting about 100 calls a week from people complaining about the scam and has posted a warning on its website the consulate became aware of the phone scam last august it 's still a severe situation , says ma chao , a consulate official ma says he has reported the calls to the chinese police but was told it would be very difficult to track down the scammers these calls could easily be made from anywhere in the world , from europe or africa or asia , he says he adds that he has heard about similar scams that originate in taiwan and parts of southeast asia in the u s , the scam is n't limited to new york similar calls , in mandarin , have been reported in cities such as boston and houston the chinese consulates in san francisco and los angeles and the embassy in washington , d c , have issued warnings about the scam the federal trade commission , which helps consumers and law enforcement collect information on illegal phone calls , has posted its own warnings the calls have also surfaced in australia and canada at a news conference last year , staff sgt annie linteau of the royal canadian mounted police said the calls reported to the rcmp accused the recipient of a financial crime , just like the calls the nypd is investigating , but then , the victims are instructed to isolate themselves , and their family in china are made to believe their loved ones in canada are abducted the rcmp calls this scheme virtual kidnapping you would n't expect it , but people do fall for that sort of thing , says ben yates , a lawyer based in hong kong specializing in cybersecurity and cryptocurrencies at the international law firm rpc yates suspects chinese living overseas , even law abiding citizens , are vulnerable because they have legitimate worries about the government monitoring their activities if you 're based overseas and you 're from mainland china , then you may be concerned about the authorities questioning what you 're doing , he says whether it involves transferring money out of china or other aspects of your activities , it could be all kinds of things the authorities could have an interest in you have to understand the sort of regime they 're used to dealing with and the sort of political and legal system that operates in mainland china that might be quite different to what you 're used to in the u s to add to the confusion , the calls look legitimate because scammers are able to make the caller id display the number for an actual chinese consulate this is known as spoofing and is a common , illegal tactic to get people to answer robocalls , which are illegal in the u s unless you have asked to be put on a call list lawyer yates says that although the scammers are very likely operating out of mainland china , the money is often sent to a hong kong bank where it 's easier to open an account and raises less suspicion from authorities because of the high volume of international transactions there a lack of mandarin language skills may protect some people from this robocall scam , but it 's not the only one out there robocalls are the top complaint at the federal communications commission , with more than 4 5 million in 2017 , up from 3 4 million in 2016 one way to cut down on unwanted calls is to put your phone number on the national do not call registry but the best way to avoid being scammed \? when the voice on the other end is a recording , just hang up colorado springs , colo a pervasive new phone scam aims to steal your identity by obtaining your social security number in order to be compromised it was really legit , it sounded really legit , said roberto ortega , who received a call earlier this week scammers are impersonating agents with the social security administration they said my social had been suspended for illegal activity and they needed to confirm my identity , ortega said the scammer will then ask to confirm the social security number or threaten that your assets will be frozen that 's the scam , but the catch is the caller may know more about you than you might think he tells me my name , he tells me my phone number , he tells me my date of birth , even my address , said ortega it made it really believable according to security experts , some victims are more susceptible than others for example , if you 've ever received a strange text asking to click on a random link more often than not , that exposes personal information on your device this then makes certain victim 's information more likely to be a target the text may also be referred to as a malicious link that aims to gain control of devices or access information you can never be too safe or too secure with your personal information , said det jon price , with the el paso county sheriff 's office price explains victims are just as susceptible to fraud on social media sites , like facebook it 's a simple search on sites like pipl that allow anyone to dig up specific details about people 's lives bottom line , tighten your privacy settings and block spam calls from your phone to do this for facebook , go to your settings page and make sure friends only is selected in every box to keep limited access to your profile st cloud the stearns county sheriff 's office is warning you about a recent phone scam that 's circulating around the st cloud metro area stearns county sheriff don gudmundson says scammers are calling people and telling them they have pending criminal charges against them the scammer then directs the person to contact the irs at a provided number or be subject to arrest authorities say these calls are not authentic and are only being used as a way for the scammer to get money out of you the irs does n't contact people this way gudmundson says if you do receive a call like this , hang up in some cases , people have received multiple calls however , it 's not necessary to call authorities at this point since they have several reports already filed when people talk about phone scams , it 's often the variety of fraud that can occur through cold calls to a person 's home or mobile device like when scammers leave vaguely official sounding voicemails claiming to be internal revenue service agents who need all of your personal information \( and probably some form of payment \) to close a faux tax audit or when some joker calls with the breathless information that you 've won a free vacation all you have to do is fork over a couple hundred bucks in prize tax to claim a trip that does n't exist but as technology advances , scammers are getting more sophisticated they 're increasingly using fraud to take control of people 's phones , often without the device ever leaving a victim 's pocket it 's almost the same as having the device physically stolen , says eva velasquez , president of the identity theft resource center they could have access to the data for any accounts that you use your phone to access it 's called porting out thieves use a person 's information to switch his or her phone number to a new phone with a new service provider they can then use the phone to intercept messages that includes two factor authentication messages , the codes that banks and others often send their customers to confirm their identity before customers can access their accounts online essentially , they 're getting their hands on your id credentials somehow , velasquez says then they 're contacting your mobile carrier and transferring those credentials to a new device the scam is n't new , but fraudsters are having enough success with it to get mobile phone service providers' attention t mobile , at t , sprint and verizon have all warned customers in recent months of the threat of porting out schemes the four major u s carriers also have created a task force to come up with ways to better authenticate that folks who ask to move their numbers from one service or phone to another are actually the numbers' owners here 's one sure sign that you may be the victim of porting out fraud your phone goes dark unexpectedly there are plenty of reasons why a phone may shut down , from a shoddy battery , extreme heat , water damage or missed payments but when a fraudster switches your number to another device , that will also do the trick the scam normally starts with a thief getting hold of enough of your personal information to pose as you when asking your phone carrier to port out your number info like social security numbers , mailing addresses , phone numbers and email addresses are often obtained through basic internet and social media searches or through web based black markets if you think you 've been victimized by porting out , there are a few things you should do after contacting your phone service provider check your bank , credit card and other accounts to make sure you can still log in to them online and that there 's been no suspicious activity like unauthorized purchases or information changes it 's also worth considering freezing your credit to stop anyone from opening new accounts in your name you can also create a fraud alert through credit reporting bureaus as an additional protection while you 're doing that , be sure to snag a free credit report to check for suspicious activity velasquez says there are plenty of things people can do to avoid being ported out in the first place that starts with changing the way you think about your device we often do n't treat a mobile device like the computer that it is , velasquez says you need to think about your device the same way you think about your laptop that means getting antivirus and malware protection it also means using the tools that many cell phone service providers already offer , like port validation protection port validation requires device users to create a separate password , which he or she has to enter before the service provider will approve a request to move the number to another phone or account some service providers \? like verizon and sprint \? require customers to select a port out validation pin when they sign up for service of course , fraudsters could still find a way to manipulate or get their hands on port validation pins but the move provides an extra layer of protection that thieves have to get through in order to take your phone you might think only the naive and gullible fall victim to online scams , but scammers actually target everyone here 's how to avoid falling into their traps getting incessant phone calls from a foreign land \? even if you re a worldly character , think twice before picking up if it s an unknown number with an unusual country code , you probably shouldn t answer and certainly don t call back because it will end up costing you it s likely that such calls are something known as a wangiri scam after a japanese word which loosely translates to one ring and cut the phone calls essentially prank your phone in the hopes you will call back at which point you might be unwittingly racking up a hefty bill this type of scam has become increasingly common with calls originating from places like cuba , africa and latvia targeting mobile customers in australia in recent months this past weekend , i received one from morocco and latvia fellow news com au tech writer jennifer dudley nicholson was bombarded with calls from latvia over the weekend argh ! getting phone calls from latvia on the hour , every hour tonight , she wrote on twitter other australians have been reporting the same thing some appeared quite perplexed by the onslaught of foreign prank calls speaking to the abc earlier this year , the australian competition and consumer commission s deputy chair , delia rickard , recommended ignoring calls from country codes you don t recognise what typically happens is the scammer calls for just one ring then cuts the line leaving a missed call on the victim s phone , she said then the victim calls the number back and they could be put on hold , have music playing or they could try and chat the objective is to keep you on the phone for as long as possible the scammers often call on premium lines similar to those used by psychic hotlines or sex lines that can end up costing you a small fortune but wangiri calls are different and ms rickard said with scams like these , the perpetrators can find a way to get some of the money charged for calling the premium line \? and it s very difficult for telcos to prevent according to the accc s scamwatch , australians have lost more than 48 , 000 to premium service scam calls in the past year so if you see someone calling from latvia , proceed with caution a few days ago , i got a call from a number i didn t recognize a string of calls , actually , in a span of about three minutes i ignored them at first , like i do with every unknown number that flashes on my cell phone screen \( don t we all \? \) but after five back to back missed calls , there was a growing sense of urgency so i typed the number into google , and realized , with horror , that it belonged to a local police station i called back , and got the switchboard for manhattan s 24th precinct who needs bail money \? i wondered did that creepy okcupid date finally murder somebody \? am i being asked to testify \? as i listened to an automated voice rattle off a list of extensions , my phone buzzed again \? another call from the precinct this time , i answered hi is this miss kristen bahler \? this is very urgent do you know that you re the subject of an fbi investigation \? do you know you re under investigation \? have you been briefed on your file \? this is very serious if you don t comply , someone will come and arrest you after a few minutes of escalating frustration on both ends , and several failed attempts to press the guy for more information , it finally clicked this wasn t a federal agent this was a scammer eventually , he hung up on me , and i was left with some burning questions who was this criminal mastermind , and how did he get my number \? what , exactly , was his end game \? did he want my money \? my social security number \? do other people get these calls \? do they fall for them \? why did the call come from an actual police station \? \? \? \? the real new york police department didn t have any answers i called the switchboard again , and tried a few of the extensions eventually i got through to an investigator , who told me he didn t have a clue what i was talking about they called you from this number \? he asked and said you re under investigation \? are you \? next , i tried paige hanson , identity education lead at the cybersecurity firm symantec \( which makes norton antivirus software \) she was less confused this is a common scam , she says it happens to a lot of people it even has a name spoofing , a range of techniques criminals use to pretend to be someone they re not with the help of fake ip addresses , emails , or , in my case , phone numbers what they wanted was for me to handover my credit card number , in a panic , which they could have charged for any number of purchases , or my social security number , making me one of the more than 15 million americans who fall prey to identify fraud every year it s actually pretty easy to hijack a phone number , hanson says thanks to apps like spoofcard , anyone with internet access can disguise their personal number with a new one of their choosing \? even if it already belongs to a law enforcement agency , a hospital , or an outback steakhouse these apps market their services as a way for debt collectors , private investigators , and other professionals to mask their identity , and as an all in good fun conduit to prank calls but hanson says they ve also empowered fraudsters to scare people into answering bogus calls the urge to answer becomes harder to resist , she says and when you do pick up the phone , you get a fear based message that sends you into the red zone there s not a lot of data on how widespread spoofing actually is , but fraudulent calls are certainly a problem regulators are grappling with according to the ftc , the state of new york alone logged more than 16 , 000 complaints of imposter calls last year nationally , that number s close to 300 , 000 and since a lot of people who get these calls don t actually report them , those figures are probably just scratching the surface how do you suss out a real fbi or police call from a fake one \? in a press release about the scam , the fbi warns consumers that the fbi does not call private citizens threatening arrest or requesting money chances are , if you re under investigation by the fbi , you won t learn about it in a phone call if you re not yet deeply unsettled , here s a bit of info that should do the trick services like spoofcard can completely mask a phone number , so the one users choose to replace it with \( the nypd s , in my case \) is the number that shows up on both your phone bill , and your caller id gullible consumers aren t the only ones at risk a fraudulent phone bill makes it hard for other vulnerable groups , like victims of stalking , to get the proof they need to seek legal protections from an abuser spoofcard , for what it s worth , seems fine with this a recent blog post on the company s website gives step by step instructions for contacting an ex who s blocked you from their phone hanson couldn t say for sure where the scammer got my number from , but says giant data breaches like the 2013 target breach that resulted in a treasure trove of stolen phone numbers , emails , and credit card information \? have made it pretty easy for criminals to get that information too as a precaution , she recommended adding my number to the national do not call registry , a federal department that blocks businesses from slamming consumers with unsolicited calls ideally , the registry will cut the volume of calls i receive , and will make me think twice before answering one that does make it through \( its likely to be a scam \) there are also a number of call blocking apps that can help manage incoming calls , hanson points out it s really just a matter of upping your game , hanson says now , you have to be vigilant about where you re giving your information , what you re providing , and what phone calls you re answering expert approved advice to never answer the phone again \? now that s a silver lining close to half of all calls to mobile phones will be fraudulent in 2019 unless measures are taken to mitigate the surge , according to a new report the report from first orion , which provides call management and protection services for major carriers like t mobile , states there has been an alarming spike in fraudulent calls over the past year , zooming from 3 7 percent of total calls in 2017 to 29 2 percent in 2018 that is expected to jumping to 44 6 percent by early 2019 over 50 billion calls made to cell phone customers over the past 18 months were analyzed for the report facebook accused of censorship by liberal site after weekly standard fact checks article call spoofing \? where the originating call is spoofed or disguised \? is getting increasingly annoying and sophisticated for example , neighborhood or community spoofing disguises the fraudulent call by matching the area code and the three digit prefix to your phone number this increases the likelihood that you will answer the call third party call blocking apps are largely ineffective when it comes to detecting spoof calls since they can only black list against known scam numbers , not legitimate numbers that are momentarily hijacked by scammers , first orion said in a statement cell phone users without adequate call blocking or call screening can be swamped everyday by fraudulent calls carriers are trying to fight this verizon , for example , offers a spam filter app that can block calls based on the risk level set by the user unfortunately , scammers are constantly changing tactics so it s a whack a mole game trying to prevent the calls , a verizon spokesperson told fox news it s a complicated problem with no simple solutions , the spokesperson added and the problem is also a legal one currently it 's not illegal to spoof another person 's phone number , verizon told fox news in an email we support federal legislation that would go after the spammers that are making these calls the fcc is working to boost measures to fight phone fraud via shaken stir , a standard for the cryptographic signing of telephone calls the goal is to eradicate spoofed numbers from the telephone system us is the world's hotspot for malicious websites a critical element of solving this problem is call authentication \? essentially creating a digital fingerprint for each phone call that scammers can t spoof or misuse , fcc chairman ajit pai said in may for consumers , this means the number displayed on the caller id would be the number that the call actually originated from this capability could be operational sometime next year first orion , for its part , is planning to introduce its callprinting technology to carriers to thwart fraudulent calls later this year phone scammers purporting to be from a chinese consulate office are tricking people in the u s into handing over huge sums of money the federal trade commission \( ftc \) said the chinese language calls appear to be going to people with chinese last names those outside the apparent target group may be unaffected by the racket , but the ftc warned everyone to be vigilant as scammers tactics can change quickly the commission said that people across the u s have been reporting the calls , which appear to deploy a range of tactics in a bid to trick the recipient some begin with an instruction to pick up a package at a nearby chinese consular office , while others ask for information to avoid being in trouble with the chinese consulate , the ftc said the scammer could also trick the person into thinking they re in some kind of trouble and could face arrest if they travel to china at some point , the caller will ask for personal details such as bank or credit card information , or for a bank transfer to be made and the ruse is clearly working since december , 21 members of new york city s chinese community have lost a total of 2 5 million , according to the new york police department , with individuals reporting losses ranging from 1 , 800 to 1 4 million , according to voices of ny some have lost their life savings the caller ids appear to indicate that the calls are coming from a local number , but investigators say it s actually coming from a location in china the ftc reminded people never to send money to anyone who asks you to do so over the phone never give your social security number , your bank or credit card number , or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it , the commission said same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as wechat just don t respond that s a scam and neither the real chinese consulates , nor the chinese embassy , will ever call you to ask for money the ftc told recipients of such scam calls to act decisively if you get a call or message like this , hang up or delete it , and then tell the ftc if you have business with the real chinese consulate and you re worried , contact the real chinese consulate by looking up your local office s number but , whatever you do , don t give out your information \? or your money \? to anyone who contacts you out of the blue more than 100 phone calls have flooded the portage county sheriff 's office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested this is the latest scam hitting residents in portage county where even the sheriff received one of those calls i actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up i played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes i asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him \? i said i am the local sheriff and he hung up , explained sheriff mike lukas , portage county sheriff 's office the scammers use fake names and bogus irs identification numbers and , in some cases , they may know a lot about who they are calling even the caller id can appear to look like it is the irs jennifer sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls she got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year earlier this year i got a voicemail that i was going to be taken into custody and i thought 'oh my god what do i do \? ' but this one i was kind of taken like this is n't real they were saying i was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name , said sisley if you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay those are definitely scams , said sheriff lukas just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it , said sisley to file a complaint with the irs click here or contact the irs by calling 800 366 4484 nbn robocall scam threatens to disconnect households from the internet a phone scam claiming to be from the national broadband network \( nbn \) has ramped up in queensland , with one woman harassed eight times in the past three days the abc has been told the robocalls include an automated voice , warning the nbn would be turned off in the local area so maintenance work could be undertaken people are prompted to press 1 to discuss the matter further , or 2 to disconnect from the internet beryce nelson from toogoolawah in the brisbane valley said the nbn was not available in her area , so she knew it was some kind of scam i 've had eight of them over the past three days , repeated calls \? robocalls \? from an organisation or group of people pretending to be nbn , and i would think that there would be something involving your bank account details if you did get into any discussion with them , she said i was intimidated the second and third time and it 's because i thought , 'well maybe it is the nbn' , and then i thought , 'no do n't be silly \? we do n't have the nbn' she said she hung up the phone and did not engage , but was worried not everyone would realise the calls were part of a scam the electronic voice is very authoritative and scary , ms nelson said i just want to let people know that if they get this call , it 's not fair dinkum , because if you were in an nbn area , you might very well think it was real she said she had tried to contact nbn co to let them know about the phone calls , but had not been able to get through i did try but the wait time was very long and that 's probably because there might be a lot of people getting this call who are trying to follow up , just being confused and a bit afraid , she said the abc has been told similar scam nbn calls have been received in victoria nbn co told the abc it was aware of scammers asking for personal information and financial details nbn co chief security officer darren kane said people needed to protect their personal information by being on guard , verifying who they were talking to and never disclosing bank accounts or other personal details to an unsolicited caller it is important to be aware that nbn co will never make unsolicited calls or door knock to sell broadband services , he said nbn co may make calls to individuals registered on our medical alarm or fire and lift registers , but will never request payment or bank account details during these calls mr kane said any scams should be reported to the australian competition and consumer commission through its scamwatch website just like well known scams in which callers claim to be from the internal revenue service , this phishing scam plays on fear in the chinese community washington \? a scam targeting the chinese community in montgomery county , maryland , fleeced several people of over a million dollars just like other well known scams \? like the one in which a caller claims to be from the internal revenue service , or another where the victim is threatened with a fine for missing jury duty \? this phishing scam plays on fear , said brandon mengedoht , a detective with montgomery county police s financial crimes division out of the blue , the speaker on the other end will identify themselves as some type of law enforcement \? either the chinese government or from hong kong , or taiwan , in some cases , said mengedoht the caller will then demand the recipient pay a fine immediately over the phone , and often will call back and demand more money , or claim the payment did not go through since may , just seven victims have lost a combined 1 4 million we had one victim suffer over 700 , 000 alone , he said investigators believe the victims could be connected through a church , neighborhood or community listserv containing personal information which ultimately fell into the wrong hands mengedoht said the culprit could also be robocalls that cast a wide net , in hope of capturing at least a couple of big fish this is an affinity type fraud they re targeting their own community there could be victims out there who are embarrassed and don t want to come forward , but the information they have might lead to identifying who they are or prevent this from happening to the next victim like wtop on facebook and follow wtop on twitter to engage in conversation about this

in the past year so if you see someone calling from latvia , proceed with caution a few days ago , i got a call from a number i didn t recognize a string of calls , actually , in a span of about three minutes i ignored them at first , like i do with every unknown number that flashes on my cell phone screen \( don t we all \? \) but after five back to back missed calls , there was a growing sense of urgency so i typed the number into google , and realized , with horror , that it belonged to a local police station i called back , and got the switchboard for manhattan s 24th precinct who needs bail money \? i wondered did that creepy okcupid date finally murder somebody \? am i being asked to testify \? as i listened to an automated voice rattle off a list of extensions , my phone buzzed again \? another call from the precinct this time , i answered hi is this miss kristen bahler \? this is very urgent do you know that you re the subject of an fbi investigation \? do you know you re under investigation \? have you been briefed on your file \? this is very serious if you don t comply , someone will come and arrest you after a few minutes of escalating frustration on both ends , and several failed attempts to press the guy for more information , it finally clicked this wasn t a federal agent this was a scammer eventually , he hung up on me , and i was left with some burning questions who was this criminal mastermind , and how did he get my number \? what , exactly , was his end game \? did he want my money \? my social security number \? do other people get these calls \? do they fall for them \? why did the call come from an actual police station \? \? \? \? the real new york police department didn t have any answers i called the switchboard again , and tried a few of the extensions eventually i got through to an investigator , who told me he didn t have a clue what i was talking about they called you from this number \? he asked and said you re under investigation \? are you \? next , i tried paige hanson , identity education lead at the cybersecurity firm symantec \( which makes norton antivirus software \) she was less confused this is a common scam , she says it happens to a lot of people it even has a name spoofing , a range of techniques criminals use to pretend to be someone they re not with the help of fake ip addresses , emails , or , in my case , phone numbers what they wanted was for me to handover my credit card number , in a panic , which they could have charged for any number of purchases , or my social security number , making me one of the more than 15 million americans who fall prey to identify fraud every year it s actually pretty easy to hijack a phone number , hanson says thanks to apps like spoofcard , anyone with internet access can disguise their personal number with a new one of their choosing \? even if it already belongs to a law enforcement agency , a hospital , or an outback steakhouse these apps market their services as a way for debt collectors , private investigators , and other professionals to mask their identity , and as an all in good fun conduit to prank calls but hanson says they ve also empowered fraudsters to scare people into answering bogus calls the urge to answer becomes harder to resist , she says and when you do pick up the phone , you get a fear based message that sends you into the red zone there s not a lot of data on how widespread spoofing actually is , but fraudulent calls are certainly a problem regulators are grappling with according to the ftc , the state of new york alone logged more than 16 , 000 complaints of imposter calls last year nationally , that number s close to 300 , 000 and since a lot of people who get these calls don t actually report them , those figures are probably just scratching the surface how do you suss out a real fbi or police call from a fake one \? in a press release about the scam , the fbi warns consumers that the fbi does not call private citizens threatening arrest or requesting money chances are , if you re under investigation by the fbi , you won t learn about it in a phone call if you re not yet deeply unsettled , here s a bit of info that should do the trick services like spoofcard can completely mask a phone number , so the one users choose to replace it with \( the nypd s , in my case \) is the number that shows up on both your phone bill , and your caller id gullible consumers aren t the only ones at risk a fraudulent phone bill makes it hard for other vulnerable groups , like victims of stalking , to get the proof they need to seek legal protections from an abuser spoofcard , for what it s worth , seems fine with this a recent blog post on the company s website gives step by step instructions for contacting an ex who s blocked you from their phone hanson couldn t say for sure where the scammer got my number from , but says giant data breaches like the 2013 target breach that resulted in a treasure trove of stolen phone numbers , emails , and credit card information \? have made it pretty easy for criminals to get that information too as a precaution , she recommended adding my number to the national do not call registry , a federal department that blocks businesses from slamming consumers with unsolicited calls ideally , the registry will cut the volume of calls i receive , and will make me think twice before answering one that does make it through \( its likely to be a scam \) there are also a number of call blocking apps that can help manage incoming calls , hanson points out it s really just a matter of upping your game , hanson says now , you have to be vigilant about where you re giving your information , what you re providing , and what phone calls you re answering expert approved advice to never answer the phone again \? now that s a silver lining earlier this month , a bargersville woman got a phone call from a number belonging to the johnson county sheriff 's office she answered , and the caller explained to her that she had a warrant out for her arrest for missing jury duty to make it right and avoid arrest , she would have to pay a heavy fine the number was checked and appeared to be authentic , but the caller had no affiliation with sheriff 's office the person on the line was simply a scammer willing to say anything to fleece thousands of dollars from his target and experts warn that there are countless others looking to commit this kind of fraud searching for their next victim biles speaks out simone biles criticizes new gymnastics ceo for anti nike tweet keeping his word 3 years later , impd officer who met a boy at his mom 's murder scene is keeping a promise this kind of scam had often been perpetrated in the past by someone claiming to be form the irs , saying that that somebody owes a penalty , it s overdue and they ll be arrested , said eugene spafford , a purdue university professor of computer science who is a member of the national cyber security hall of fame another thing that often shows up is someone who claims to be from a credit card company or a bank saying that you 're really overdue or they suspect fraud , and they want people to respond with information that would then be used to commit fraud the general problem is the same phone calls and emails are n't really verified and somebody who understands the technology can spoof those , just like if you were to get a letter in the mail anybody can type in a return address or even mock up a letterhead that does n't necessarily match the person who is sending it according to a police report from the johnson county sheriff 's office , the suspect carried out his scheme on the 47 year old bargersville woman on oct 5 the woman told police that she got a call at work from someone claiming to be law enforcement who explained that she would be arrested if she did n't immediately pay a fine the woman was directed to leave work and call a provided number , police said when she did , the call got disrupted she quickly got a call back from a different number she checked the number online , and saw that it was the non emergency number for the johnson county sheriff 's office the call between her and a man who called himself roy lasted nearly three hours , police said roy said to take care of the warrant , the woman had to go to a local kroger and buy 5 , 500 in prepaid debit cards and provide the card numbers over the phone , which she did the woman told police that roy may have also obtained her social security number and a photo of her driver 's license during the interaction he threatened that she would face more criminal charges if she told anyone about the call when the woman asked if she could just go to the sheriff 's office to pay the fine , roy told her she would be placed under arrest if she did that the police reports states that roy could also tell when the woman was driving and where she was the woman drove to the sheriff 's office while still on the call with roy , according to the police report when the caller learned that she was going to police , he threatened to put her personal information on the dark web and child pornography websites as the woman went to end the call , roy said that he was a hacker who had taken all of her money and that there was nothing she could do about it , according to the police report at the sheriff 's office , police explained the process of call spoofing , which is when an individual places a call and makes it look like it is coming from a different number spafford , who served as a cybersecurity adviser to three past u s presidents , said no matter if it 's a phone call , an email or even an in person solicitation , the best way to handle this kind of scam is the same get a name , and if possible a case number for whatever it is you 're being called about whoever is calling should be willing to give you that , he said hang up , find the real number , and call it back call them and explain that you want to talk to deputy so and so or whoever contacted you and verify the details spafford said when fraudsters are presented with such a request , they will usually decline he added that they will pressure targets by saying that they are out of time , or that this is their last chance to avoid arrest but if it 's a real law enforcement agency , they will understand , he said spafford said the mention of gift or prepaid cards is also an immediately red flag no legitimate agency , be it at the federal , state or local level , will ask for gift cards ever , he said that is not a legitimate form of payment for debt , and as soon as people hear that , they should hang up , call the actual law enforcement agency and report the fraud these kinds of scams have been around for decades , spafford explained , and new technology makes them even more common there are a number of ways to spoof phone numbers , and even free apps that exist for regular citizens to hide or fake their numbers other scams to be cautious of are people calling to report an issue with your computer or smartphone software , and people claiming to raise money for a recent disaster like hurricane michael basically these people are taking advantage of the available technology , spafford said the fcc does not require that the phone system present phone numbers accurately , and the \( email \) system does not require that you specify the correct email as a result , people that do n't understand that can be easily taken advantage of call indystar reporter justin l mack at 317 444 6138 follow him on twitter justinlmack close to half of all calls to mobile phones will be fraudulent in 2019 unless measures are taken to mitigate the surge , according to a new report the report from first orion , which provides call management and protection services for major carriers like t mobile , states there has been an alarming spike in fraudulent calls over the past year , zooming from 3 7 percent of total calls in 2017 to 29 2 percent in 2018 that is expected to jumping to 44 6 percent by early 2019 over 50 billion calls made to cell phone customers over the past 18 months were analyzed for the report facebook accused of censorship by liberal site after weekly standard fact checks article call spoofing \? where the originating call is spoofed or disguised \? is getting increasingly annoying and sophisticated for example , neighborhood or community spoofing disguises the fraudulent call by matching the area code and the three digit prefix to your phone number this increases the likelihood that you will answer the call third party call blocking apps are largely ineffective when it comes to detecting spoof calls since they can only black list against known scam numbers , not legitimate numbers that are momentarily hijacked by scammers , first orion said in a statement cell phone users without adequate call blocking or call screening can be swamped everyday by fraudulent calls carriers are trying to fight this verizon , for example , offers a spam filter app that can block calls based on the risk level set by the user unfortunately , scammers are constantly changing tactics so it s a whack a mole game trying to prevent the calls , a verizon spokesperson told fox news it s a complicated problem with no simple solutions , the spokesperson added and the problem is also a legal one currently it 's not illegal to spoof another person 's phone number , verizon told fox news in an email we support federal legislation that would go after the spammers that are making these calls the fcc is working to boost measures to fight phone fraud via shaken stir , a standard for the cryptographic signing of telephone calls the goal is to eradicate spoofed numbers from the telephone system us is the world's hotspot for malicious websites a critical element of solving this problem is call authentication \? essentially creating a digital fingerprint for each phone call that scammers can t spoof or misuse , fcc chairman ajit pai said in may for consumers , this means the number displayed on the caller id would be the number that the call actually originated from this capability could be operational sometime next year first orion , for its part , is planning to introduce its callprinting technology to carriers to thwart fraudulent calls later this year phone scammers purporting to be from a chinese consulate office are tricking people in the u s into handing over huge sums of money the federal trade commission \( ftc \) said the chinese language calls appear to be going to people with chinese last names those outside the apparent target group may be unaffected by the racket , but the ftc warned everyone to be vigilant as scammers tactics can change quickly the commission said that people across the u s have been reporting the calls , which appear to deploy a range of tactics in a bid to trick the recipient some begin with an instruction to pick up a package at a nearby chinese consular office , while others ask for information to avoid being in trouble with the chinese consulate , the ftc said the scammer could also trick the person into thinking they re in some kind of trouble and could face arrest if they travel to china at some point , the caller will ask for personal details such as bank or credit card information , or for a bank transfer to be made and the ruse is clearly working since december , 21 members of new york city s chinese community have lost a total of 2 5 million , according to the new york police department , with individuals reporting losses ranging from 1 , 800 to 1 4 million , according to voices of ny some have lost their life savings the caller ids appear to indicate that the calls are coming from a local number , but investigators say it s actually coming from a location in china the ftc reminded people never to send money to anyone who asks you to do so over the phone never give your social security number , your bank or credit card number , or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it , the commission said same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as wechat just don t respond that s a scam and neither the real chinese consulates , nor the chinese embassy , will ever call you to ask for money the ftc told recipients of such scam calls to act decisively if you get a call or message like this , hang up or delete it , and then tell the ftc if you have business with the real chinese consulate and you re worried , contact the real chinese consulate by looking up your local office s number but , whatever you do , don t give out your information \? or your money \? to anyone who contacts you out of the blue more than 100 phone calls have flooded the portage county sheriff 's office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested this is the latest scam hitting residents in portage county where even the sheriff received one of those calls i actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up i played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes i asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him \? i said i am the local sheriff and he hung up , explained sheriff mike lukas , portage county sheriff 's office the scammers use fake names and bogus irs identification numbers and , in some cases , they may know a lot about who they are calling even the caller id can appear to look like it is the irs jennifer sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls she got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year earlier this year i got a voicemail that i was going to be taken into custody and i thought 'oh my god what do i do \? ' but this one i was kind of taken like this is n't real they were saying i was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name , said sisley if you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay those are definitely

robocall scam threatens to disconnect households from the internet a phone scam claiming to be from the national broadband network \( nbn \) has ramped up in queensland , with one woman harassed eight times in the past three days the abc has been told the robocalls include an automated voice , warning the nbn would be turned off in the local area so maintenance work could be undertaken people are prompted to press 1 to discuss the matter further , or 2 to disconnect from the internet beryce nelson from toogoolawah in the brisbane valley said the nbn was not available in her area , so she knew it was some kind of scam i 've had eight of them over the past three days , repeated calls \? robocalls \? from an organisation or group of people pretending to be nbn , and i would think that there would be something involving your bank account details if you did get into any discussion with them , she said i was intimidated the second and third time and it 's because i thought , 'well maybe it is the nbn' , and then i thought , 'no do n't be silly \? we do n't have the nbn' she said she hung up the phone and did not engage , but was worried not everyone would realise the calls were part of a scam the electronic voice is very authoritative and scary , ms nelson said i just want to let people know that if they get this call , it 's not fair dinkum , because if you were in an nbn area , you might very well think it was real she said she had tried to contact nbn co to let them know about the phone calls , but had not been able to get through i did try but the wait time was very long and that 's probably because there might be a lot of people getting this call who are trying to follow up , just being confused and a bit afraid , she said the abc has been told similar scam nbn calls have been received in victoria nbn co told the abc it was aware of scammers asking for personal information and financial details nbn co chief security officer darren kane said people needed to protect their personal information by being on guard , verifying who they were talking to and never disclosing bank accounts or other personal details to an unsolicited caller it is important to be aware that nbn co will never make unsolicited calls or door knock to sell broadband services , he said nbn co may make calls to individuals registered on our medical alarm or fire and lift registers ,

financial crimes division out of the blue , the speaker on the other end will identify themselves as some type of law enforcement \? either the chinese government or from hong kong , or taiwan , in some cases , said mengedoht the caller will then demand the recipient pay a fine immediately over the phone , and often will call back and demand more money , or claim the payment did not go through since may , just seven victims have lost a combined 1 4 million we had one victim suffer over 700 , 000 alone , he said investigators believe the victims could be connected through a church , neighborhood or community listserv containing personal information which ultimately fell into the wrong hands mengedoht said the culprit could also be robocalls that cast a wide net , in hope of capturing at least a couple of big fish this is an affinity type fraud they re targeting their own community there could be victims out there who are embarrassed and don t want to come forward , but

western part of the county , in boyds , germantown and rockville , detective brandon mengedoht said friday two of the victims are from silver spring we believe it is affinity fraud where they target

chinese or hong kong government organization , such as a law enforcement agency , a government prosecutor or the chinese embassy in washington , d c , according to a police press statement issued

sydney woman 's mobile phone and were rapidly stealing her identity she did n't know it at the time , but kate was the helpless target of a little known scam called 'sim swapping' , where hackers can gain access to your bank account , email and social media with just a simple phone call to a mobile operator armed with kate 's name , date of birth and number , hackers phoned up the optus call centre and without her knowledge or consent secretly swapped her phone number to a sim card held by them the two text messages sent by optus confirmed kate 's issue had been resolved kate assumed both unexpected texts related to a complaint she had made several weeks earlier the reality was she 'd just been hijacked hackers then quickly broke into her social media accounts and email , where she had stored many personal documents including passport scans and other important information sim swap scammers have also been known to successfully crack banking apps linked to mobile phone numbers optus is not the lone target of sim swap hackers , with reports other australian mobile phone operators have also been duped the relative ease with which hackers can execute sim swaps poses serious questions about the level of security clearance mobile phone operators enforce kate believes the hackers initially swiped her personal details , such as her date of birth , from her facebook account within hours of kate 's phone dropping dead from the network , one of her friends was already being targeted once a facebook user 's account is compromised by sim scammers , any facebook friends who list their date of birth and phone number on their personal page will also become vulnerable hackers made numerous phone calls using kate 's number and changed the password of her email and a variety of other accounts after they have control they can use your phone number to get codes for emails , banking and everything , kate said they can also begin opening up other types of online accounts they need so little information i think this is the biggest problem kate contacted optus via its online chat support and said it took 30 minutes before someone took her complaint seriously first they told me , 'i think someone is doing work in your area' , to explain why i had no network coverage , she told nine com au eventually an optus help desk employee informed kate a hacker had taken control of her number with just the basic details a block was then put on her number you just do n't feel safe it feels like it can happen again , she said more than 200 , 000 scam reports were submitted to the australian competition and consumer commission \( accc \) in 2017 latest accc data revealed australians lost 340 million to scammers last year \? a 40 million increase from 2016 email has been the primary hunting ground for scammers , but society 's growing reliance on mobile phones means that platform will be increasingly heavily targeted an optus spokeswoman told nine com au sim swapping is an industry wide issue and we are working together with other telecommunication providers and major banks to mitigate opportunities for fraudulent activity the spokeswoman said by the time a fraudster requested a sim swap known in the industry as porting the victim and their personal details would have likely already been compromised through a phishing scam or mail theft unauthorised 'porting' of a number is undertaken by criminals with the intent to access bank accounts , the spokeswoman said the spokeswoman said a scammer would need account detail information to execute a sim swap , but did not specify precisely what that entailed worried hackers had access to her passport scans and other tier one type identification documents , kate went to the nsw police the police told me there was not a financial loss so they ca n't do anything , kate said she was instructed to lodge a complaint with acorn , the australian cybercrime online reporting network kate said mobile phone companies , such as optus , need to make it harder for scammers to sim swap and hijack someone 's online identity i tried to make a complaint with optus but they kept sending me from department to department , she said people need to be made aware how easy it can be for scammers to do this optus advises customers to report any instance of identity theft to police in the first instance , followed by optus on

prefix so people presume the calls are safe to pick up , first orion said third party call blocking apps may help protect consumers from known scam numbers , but they ca n't tell if a scammer hijacks someone 's number and uses it for scam calls year after year , the scam call epidemic bombards consumers at record breaking levels , surpassing the previous year and scammers increasingly invade our

this case , they wanted to pose as her bank so she would reveal her credit card information while the woman on the other end of the line sounded convincing and was n't asking for any personal information , buckley knew something was n't right and remembered reading about a similar incident in the news i remembered the story , so i was n't phoning my bank or anyone from my landline , buckley said i looked online and there had been no purchases go through my card , however i was concerned i thought it was a scam but i really wanted to make sure this was n't going through on my card , so i phoned tiffany 's the employee at tiffany 's confirmed buckley 's suspicions that no mary gilmore worked at that store they also told buckley she was the seventh person to call with the same concerns that day when buckley failed to use her landline within five to 10 minutes , the fake tiffany 's manager called again and asked if she had made the call and kept pressing her to do it she also said buckley could give them the phone number off the back of her credit card \? which would reveal which company she deals with tiffany co confirms there is an open investigation into the matter

latest wave of an international phone scam is affecting new zealanders and mobile companies are warning people not to call back the scam appears as a missed international phone call and charges the user hefty international fees if they return it 2degrees spokesman paul brislen said the scam is unsophisticated but is affecting mobile phone users from multiple international networks the scam is computer generated and almost impossible to stop as the calling number changes every time , he said you start off with 001001 and that does n't ring so you go through to 001002 and that one rings , great we 've got a live number , then they try 001003 and they just make their way up the number range until they hit out numbers so i presume they 've reached the 64 bracket , which is new zealand , and they 're trying all the numbers they can find , he said eventually the scammers will move on to target other international numbers , he said customers who have returned unknown international phone calls should check their phone bills and contact their network if they 've been affected , he said spark said its customers have also been targeted while a vodafone user told rnz of getting repeated missed calls from a canadian number for months finally , a little justice for the scammers who prey on the unsuspecting twenty four more phone scammers have received prison sentences of up to 20 years for fraud and money laundering the extent of their efforts was truly staggering one defendant , miteshkumar patel of illinois , received 240 months in prison followed by three years of probation patel , wrote the department of justice , served as the manager of a chicago based crew of runners that liquidated and laundered fraud proceeds generated by callers at india based call centers those callers used call scripts and lead lists to target victims throughout the united states with telefraud schemes in which the callers impersonated u s government employees from the irs and u s citizenship and immigration services \( uscis \) the callers duped victims into believing that they owed money to the u s government and would be arrested or deported if they did not pay immediately after the victims transferred money to the callers , a network of u s based runners moved expeditiously to liquidate and launder fraud proceeds through the use of anonymous stored value cards in addition to recruiting , training , and tasking runners in his crew , patel also coordinated directly with the indian side of the conspiracy about the operation of the scheme patel was held accountable for laundering between 9 5 and 25 million for the scheme the scam \? familiar to anyone with a phone number \? involves a robocall that appears to be from the irs when you call back , you get a call center staffed with threatening non english speakers who yell at you if you try to weasel out of paying them with itunes gift cards this type of fraud is sickening , said u s attorney ryan patrick in a release however , after years of investigation and incredible hard work by multiple agents and attorneys , these con artists are finally headed to prison their cruel tactics preyed on some very vulnerable people , thereby stealing millions from them these sentences should send a strong message that we will follow the trail no matter how difficult and seek justice for those victimized by these types of transnational schemes we will simply not stand by and allow criminals to use the names of legitimate government agencies to enrich themselves by victimizing others the fact that up to 25 million was collected in this scam is amazing the resourcefulness and nastiness of this particular breed of scam is truly impressive , and patel and 23 others will be going away for a while for their many crimes perry another scam is making the rounds in the metro a perry woman says someone called her , claiming he worked for a tech company , in an attempt to remotely hack into her computer she says it 's been one major headache for her ever since then he gave me my email address and said it was compromised , and i was like , he knows what he 's talking about , said gerry bacon of perry he 's got my email address he 's from google sometimes that fear allows scammers to get into your computer , explained perry police chief eric vaughn bacon says she got a surprising call on saturday morning my son had googled it while i was on the phone , and said , 'mom , hang up it 's a scam ' so , i hung up , she explained but she says the caller was persistent then , he tried calling back on a restricted number and he was like , why did you hang up on me \? ' she recalled and i told him , 'because you 're a scam you just hacked into my computer' and i hung up but the damage may have already been done bacon reached out to perry police and even the fbi for help all my clients' information , addresses , phone numbers are on there , said bacon so , i had to disconnect wifi immediately police say she 's not the only one they 've been getting at least one call a week from scammers , who 've gotten far more sophisticated with phones now , we see them spoofing local numbers even if you do n't recognize that number , let it go to voicemail and see what it says , said vaughn i have a cousin whose girlfriend got a call from '515' that did the same thing , and i have an elderly mom that 's in the hospital , and so if i see a restricted number coming through , i'm going to take it because i bet it 's going to be the hospital , said bacon bacon had to wipe her computer clean and she 's frustrated that anyone would think to target her or anyone else like her it 's like , really , people , she said come on , get better stuff to do than to bug us little people if they want to take my credit and my identity , there 's nothing there police tell local 5 that if someone calls you claiming to be with an agency like the irs or google , do n't believe it they will never call for collection over the phone also , be on the lookout for any time someone on the phone asks you to make a payment with a gift debit card or credit card have you been receiving mobile phone calls from a number starting with the digits 0088 \?

in order for mobile phone networks across different countries to communicate with each other , there is a system set up that processes the connections and also makes sure that any international charges are passed on to the person making the call , from the country the call was made to for example , if it costs you 2 to call a mobile in south africa , this system makes sure the right amount of charges are billed to you for that international connection time what 's happening with the wangiri scam is the fraudsters behind the con , compromise that system of international charges the fraudsters rely on you calling back the number after you note the missed call be warned that if you do , they pocket the cost per minute of that call and the charges are huge the best advice is to not answer any call from a number you do n't recognise and never answer a number starting with 0088 the tyler police department has seen an increasing number of cases related to phone scams in tyler , according to a news release citrus county , fla \?
