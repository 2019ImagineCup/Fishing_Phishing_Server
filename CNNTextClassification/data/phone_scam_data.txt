(MARSHALL,TX)--Harrison County Sheriff’s Office is receiving calls from citizens inquiring about warrants that are supposed to be issued for their arrest.

This is another twist on the bogus telephone call using official sounding circumstances.

The scammer sets up the caller as an official of the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office or District Attorney’s office and they want to have the person settle a case prior to being taken to court, or to post a bond for a bogus offense that has been filed against the person.

The caller gives the person a “case number”, which is bogus. The caller will then ask the person to get a Wal-Mart, CVS, or loadable credit card, for an amount of money to settle the case.

They are then given a telephone number to call. That number has been an area code of 844, which is a toll free number, recently.

After the person has obtained the card, they are instructed to call another telephone number and give the PIN number on the back of the card.

This money is then accessed by that PIN number. This is not a legitimate phone call. The District Attorney or Sheriff’s Office will not call anyone and ask for a payment.

Once this person has taken the money from the card, there is no method to retrieve the money.

The caller is most often in a foreign country and using cell phones that they manipulate to appear that they are legitimate callers from Harrison County.

As the holiday season is under-way, please be mindful that there are people that are preying on citizens and using scare tactics to take money from unsuspecting citizens.

"Many of these people that have been contacted are terrorized by these folks. They will continue to call them and quite honestly, scare them and harass them," says Lt. Jay Webb, Harrison County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer.

"The scams this time of year come around the Publisher's Clearing House. If you didn't enter the Publisher's Clearing House, you didn't win anything. They will also tell you they are from a lottery commission. Many of the times they use the lottery commissions of overseas agencies. Unless you were overseas and you bought a lottery ticket, you didn't win anything."

You might think only the naive and gullible fall victim to online scams, but scammers actually target everyone. Here's how to avoid falling into their traps.

Thousands of Australians have received a voicemail message that’s likely to have sent shivers down their spine.

The robotic-sounding voice warns the recipient that they are the subject of a lawsuit and should return the call immediately.

If they don’t, a warrant will be issued for their arrest, the message threatens.

This is the latest iteration of a well-worn scam which demands payment of a tax debt — and it has fleeced unsuspecting and terrified victims out of thousands of dollars each.

Authorities say elderly people are especially prone to believe the claim and are often threatened by fraudsters when they phone the number back.

“The reason behind this call is that there is a lawsuit cases getting filed under your name,” the computer-generated message begins.

“The moment you get this message I want you to get back to me on my department division number. Now, if we don’t hear from you, we have to issue arrest warrant under your name and get you arrested so get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you.”

In a call received by this reporter on Wednesday, the return telephone number was 08 6102 5755. The number has been reported and now appears to have been discarded by the scammers.

The Australian Taxation Office has received 28,000 reports about attempted scams since July 1, with the lawsuit-related telephone call among them.

The ATO’s Assistant Commissioner Kath Anderson said fraudsters are growing increasingly sophisticated and hope to exploit vulnerable people, often using aggressive tactics to swindle people out of their money or personal information.

The phone numbers used to call victims are always Australian-based and the latest round have carried West Australian and Victorian area codes.

However, cyber crime police have said in the past that the scammers are unlikely to be calling from Australia, but using a call forward service instead.

Some fraudsters will even offer to contact a victim’s accountant to verify that they owe money and then dial in an accomplice who impersonates the tax agent.

Ms Anderson said the peak season for scammers was about to begin, with the November 21 deadline for 2017-18 income tax payments fast approaching.

“Be wary if someone contacts you demanding payment of a tax debt you didn’t know you owed,” Ms Anderson said.

Payments through Bitcoin ATMs have now overtaken iTunes vouchers as the most common method of scam payments reported to the ATO.

“Our advice is simple — the ATO will never ask you to make a payment into an ATM or via gift or prepaid cards such as iTunes and Visa cards, or direct credit to be paid to a personal bank account,” Ms Anderson said.

The ATO never demands the immediate payment of debts in any circumstances, she said, and despite the taxman’s hard-nosed reputation, rudeness and aggression are not standard tacts.

“That’s just not how we do business,” she said.

“If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a call, hang up and call us on 1800 008 540.”

The ATO is also worried about the number of people who fall victim to non-financial scams and hand over valuable personal information to criminals.

Since July 1, some 6000 Australians have given away sensitive details including tax file numbers, bank account details and dates of birth.

“Your identifying information can be used by scammers to break into your life if they are compromised,” Ms Anderson said.

“If you’ve received an unsolicited email or text, or if you have any doubts about whether any contact is legitimately from the ATO, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us to check.

“Scammers have been known to impersonate tax agents too so it’s recommended that you hang up and call your agent direct on a number you have sourced independently.”

The Quincy Police Department said it received information about a scam that is a robocall where the caller claims to be an officer with the Social Security Administration and says there is a legal enforcement against the person's social security number. The caller provides a scam phone number to call back with a Washington, D.C., area code.

Police said residents should just hang up and not call back. The Social Security Administration will not contact residents by phone in reference to any legal actions. Residents also should not provide personal information to anyone by phone.

First Financial Bank is advising area residents of a telephone scam in which the suspects are trying to trick people into revealing their PIN numbers.

The bank said reports came in today from from residents who received calls claiming to come from the bank's fraud department. The goal of these calls was to trick people into reveal confidential information, including PIN numbers for debit cards.

FFB emphasized banks do not call to ask for such information over the telephone.

“We emphasize that anyone who gets a call such as this should not provide a debit card PIN or any other personal information,” said Don Penn, security officer at First Financial. “Hang up and contact customer service at your bank to report the call.”

The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office has received a report of another phone scam targeting local residents.

A resident told the Sheriff’s Office that she received a call from an Indianapolis phone number. The caller claimed to be with a law firm and told the resident that the firm was distributing checks for some sort of consumer survey contest. The scammer told the resident that she had won second prize, $500,000 and that the firm would be personally delivering the check to her home.

The scammers already had the resident’s home address and told the resident that they needed to ask a few questions to complete their paperwork. The scammer went on to ask for personal information, including income sources and how much the resident had in her bank account.

The resident didn’t fall for the scam but told the Sheriff’s Office that the scammer sounded legitimate and could easily trick others into falling for the scheme.

The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office would like to remind the public to never give out personal information over the phone to an unknown caller. Even if the information seems harmless, scammers can use that information to steal your identity or further victimize you. The best thing to do when an unknown, unsolicited caller asks for your personal information is to hang up and report it to the FTC.

WENATCHEE — Local police say they've gotten word of a telephone scam that attempts to coerce business employees to buy gift cards and turn over the account numbers to callers posing as investigators.

Employees at two businesses have been taken in by the scam, said Wenatchee Police Capt. Edgar Reinfeld, for losses in the neighborhood of $800 between the two.

"We know of three incidents," Reinfeld said. He would not name the businesses targeted.

Reinfeld's department has gotten numerous complaints about the scam from local businesses in the last week, reporting that callers have sought out the names of managers and owners, and later called again to pose as "detectives" or "investigators" alleging criminal activity by the businesses' senior managers.

Upon speaking to an employee, the "investigator" will allege wrongdoing on a superior's part, and encourage employees to aid the "investigation" by emptying out the cash drawer or safe, going to the nearest Target or Walmart and buying Visa gift cards. The ruse was successful in two out of the three incidents.

The losses are under investigation. Reinfeld said potential victims can fight back by taking a handful of steps:
• Demand the caller provide a number to call back along with their business name. If the number does not match caller ID for the call you answered in the first place, there is something wrong.
• Never provide a driver’s license number, Social Security number, bank or credit card account number, or any password over the phone, unless you initiated the call to someone to whom you would normally provide this information.
• Doublecheck the contact information provided online when possible. A quick search online for a provided cal back number may alert you that it has been used to scam others.
• Remember, no legitimate official or group will request payment via Visa gift cards, iTunes cards, or other similar methods.

Police have issued a warning about a new phone scam that is targeting New Zealanders.

The call comes from an international number that is redirected to a local number; with the scammer threatening they want money for damages to a car.

Police said a number of New Zealanders have been targeted by the scam.

The caller is known to be aggressive and has a strong foreign accent.

The scammer is said to demand money for damages made to a car that was supposedly involved in a car crash.

Police urge people to be aware of such phone scams and warn elderly relatives to take precautions.

The scam phone number has been noted by police as: (04) 8879519.

"We'll turn off the heat if you don't pay," is the threat scammers are making while temperatures continue to plummet.

CPS Energy is reminding customers that the utility will never threaten to turn off the power to your home to get you to pay your bill. Still, there is an increase in reports of the scam.

One military family in San Antonio was fearful their power would be turned off after getting a call and they are now out hundreds of dollars.

Juanita and Eliseo Salazar are both 83 and retired.

They have lived in San Antonio for four decades in the same house. For the first time, just this week, a bill collector called for a late payment asking for $1,000.

The person on the other end of the phone gave Juanita a tough choice.

"He said, 'If you don't want us to turn off your electric, you'll have to pay at least half of that,'" Juanita said.

With cold temperatures in our city, turning off the heat was the last thing they wanted.

"It got us rattled," Eliseo said.

Even though caller ID indicated the call came from CPS Energy, the energy provider said it's a scam, one they are seeing more of as temperatures continue to drop.

"Our money doesn't grow on trees," Juanita said.

They're living on a fixed income. The military father has military children and military grandchildren.

He ended up giving the scammer $500.

It's his mission to spread a message to families in Military City USA.

"Before you do anything, check with CPS," Eliseo said.

The Better Business Bureau of the Mid-South and the FBI are warning small business owners and franchisees in the Memphis area about a new phone scam that could cost them a full day's profit if they fall for it.

At least two local businesses have already been impacted.

Here's how the scam works: Someone will call the company, usually during the closing shift on a Saturday or Sunday. The caller will pretend to be someone with authority, in the case of franchises, the chief operating officer from the corporate office.

To further establish their authority, the scammer may also share some personal information about the company before saying there is a threat either to an individual employee or the whole company and tell the employee to gather all the cash on hand and put it all on a prepaid debit card.

"The employees who received the calls were told that they, too, would be in trouble if they did not cooperate," the BBB said in a written statement.

Once the cards are purchased, the employee is instructed to call back and give the caller the numbers. After that, a day's profit is gone.

The BBB and the FBI is warning small business owners to train their employees, especially those working nights and weekends, so more businesses aren't victimized.

The BBB didn't share which franchisees were targeted.

How to spot this scam

There are things to look out for that can often help employees and business owners tell when they are talking to a scammer, according to the BBB.

Scammers will often pretend to be a person in authority or someone employees will know and trust. They will then try to intimidate the employee and create a sense of urgency to make the employee act fast so there is no time to check on what they have been told.

It's also common to use untraceable payment methods like wire transfers, prepaid cards and gift cards.

How to report if you get a call

If you are a victim of this scam or get a similar phone call, contact the Memphis FBI Complaint hotline at 901-747-4300, the Arkansas FBI at 501-221-9100, or the Jackson FBI at 601-948-5000 to file a complaint.

A 23-year-old Hong Kong woman has been cheated out of 121,000 yuan (HK$136,000) by fraudsters posing as mainland officials on the phone, becoming the latest victim as such scams more than doubled citywide over the past four months.

The woman, who lives in May Shing Court, Sha Tin, received a call from a man impersonating a law enforcement agent from across the border, according to police.

“She was accused of being involved in a criminal case and ordered to reveal her bank information,” police said in a statement. As instructed, she complied with the con artist.

Girl, 14, among 82 students to lose HK$7.6 million in phone scams over 4 months

She realised it was a scam when she later found out the money had been transferred from her bank to another account, and called police at 9.17pm on Tuesday.

Detectives from the Sha Tin criminal investigation unit are handling the case. No arrests have been made.

Between July and October, police handled 138 phone scam cases involving fake mainland officials – a 133 per cent rise compared with 59 reports in the first six months this year.

The 138 victims scammed in the past four months included 82 mainland and Hong Kong students who were conned out of HK$7.6 million (US$970,000) in total.

Among the cases was a first-year university student from the mainland, who was duped out of HK$950,000 in mid-September. The youngest victim was a 14-year-old girl who was accused of breaking mainland law and convinced into transferring HK$27,000 to a mainland bank account in the same month.

Hong Kong businessman cheated out of record HK$58m in phone scam

Among the 82 students, 17 per cent were working on a master’s degree or PhD, 60 per cent were bachelor’s degree students, while 7 per cent were in secondary school. The remaining 16 per cent were studying diploma or sub-degree programmes.

The surge had prompted the force to issue an alert on its website warning the public to be on the lookout for scammers.

In the whole of last year, police handled 698 phone scam cases involving bogus mainland officials.

The city’s biggest telephone deception case involved a 52-year-old Yuen Long resident conned out of more than HK$58 million in 2016.

Many of those falling prey received pre-recorded calls from swindlers pretending to be the staff of couriers firms, telecom companies or the Hong Kong Immigration Department, before the calls were transferred to fraudsters impersonating officers from mainland public security departments.

Victims are often accused of violating mainland laws. They are then assured by scammers posing as mainland police officers that their case will be investigated properly if they transfer funds to a designated bank account as surety.

A Wauwatosa Police captain received a shocking response when he confronted a ring of scammers over the phone.

Capt. Brian Zalewski posted a video of the interaction on the police department's Facebook page.

Zalewski said a woman alerted police about the scam after someone called her from the Wauwatosa Police Department's phone number and provided her with a different number to call back in order to pay fines.

She told police that, upon calling the second number, she was told she owed $1,900 in fines and that her credit report was showing the outstanding debts.

Following the woman's complaint, Zalewski called the number, which begins with area code 844.

Zalewski told the scammer he was calling to inquire about a call that claimed he owed the police department money for fines, and asked the person on the other end of the line what the charges against him are.

"The charges against your name are that you're a (expletive) stupid person," the scammer answered.

"How much is that going to cost me, then?" Zalewski asked.

"It's going to cost you a lot, being stupid," the man on the other end of the line replied.

Zalewski said other areas of the country have reported similar scams, with some victims in Ventura County, California being provided the same, 844 number to call back.

According to the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau, several students at UW-Stevens Point were duped by a scam in which spoofers used the number for the Green Bay Police Department. That happened a couple years ago.

"I want to know why you're using our department's phone number to try and scam people," Zalewski told a second scammer upon dialing the 844 number back.

"Because it's good and easy money," the scammer said.

"Because it scares them off," the crook added.

"I'm going to respectfully ask you to stop doing that, and stop victimizing people," Zalewski said.

"Sorry, I can't do that," the scammer replied.

Zalewski said Wauwatosa Police will continue to investigate the scam and try to put as much information about it as possible out to the public to minimize the number of people victimized.

According to Jonathan Arnold, an IT instructor at Milwaukee Area Technical College, the technique the scammers are using to mask their phone number as Wauwatosa Police's is called "spoofing."

Arnold said it involves setting up a "private branch exchange," which is what allows a caller to alter the phone number that appears on a call recipient's caller ID.

He said the technology has become much easier to purchase and use with the growing popularity of phone lines over the internet, rather than through the traditional, phone jack in a home or business's wall.

"Two hours, $20, and you can probably do it yourself if you want," Arnold said.

He said many businesses use private branch exchanges to control what number appears on a client or customer's phone. Arnold said the technology is especially popular among businesses who have clients in different states.

"This is just a case of scammers misusing that legitimate technology," he said.

Arnold said the technology does not allow the caller to change his or her actual number, which is why the scammers targeting the woman in Tosa still provided an 844 number to call back.

Jim Temmer, the President/CEO of the Wisconsin BBB, said that should be a red flag - especially if someone calls you asking for money or personal information.

"We tell people, if you don't know the phone number calling you, or you're not sure, don't answer," Temmer said. "If it's important they'll leave a message."

"Then you can look up their phone number and call them back," he said.

Temmer also said, while the scammers on the other end of the line often sound amateurish, people more easily fork over money when they're scared.

"It's all about fear," Temmer said. "When people are thinking emotionally, they don't make good decisions."

A Kamloops resident is out $4,000 after receiving a phone call from a scammer and Mounties are warning others to be wary of such fraudsters.

Cpl. Jodi Shelkie said the victim answered a call from a man claiming to be employed in the security department of a major Canadian bank.

The caller told the victim to use a credit card to purchase Apple gifts cards and, utilizing a downloaded computer program, scan and upload the card’s information into the program. The victim was assured they would be reimbursed for the expenditure by the bank.

Alas, when the $4,000 was not reimbursed, the victim called the bank and learned it was a scam.

Shelkie said people need to be wary of calls, texts or emails from people claiming to be from a bank.

“Banks will never request that their customers purchase gift cards of any kind,” Shelkie said. “If you are unsure if a phone call, letter or email is a scam, check with the bank by contacting them yourself. Look up the bank’s phone number independently or go in person.”

Scams can be reported to the federal government’s Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre by calling 1-888-495-8501. It is a toll-free number.

Southern Power District is asking customers to be wary of callers who try to collect on power bills.

The company says they've seen an increase this week in the number of suspicious calls being reported by businesses. They say scammers are posing as the company and are demanding immediate payment for accounts that are reportedly past due. They say customers are being told that their meter will be disconnected if they fail to pay their bill.

The company said if you receive a phone call from a person claiming to be a representative of Southern Power District, hang up the phone and contact Southern at 800-579-3019. They said they will verify the current status of your account. They also ask you to contact local law enforcement if you receive such a call.



Southern Power District’s accurate contact information can be found on their website.

As the holiday season comes upon us, it is also the season for holiday phone scammers whose unwanted calls do their best to rob us of our money and holiday cheer.

For example, this week Southern Power District is warning the public to be wary of callers who attempt to collect on power bills.

“We have seen an increase this week in the number of suspicious calls being reported by businesses,” said LeAnne Doose, SPD communications director.

She said phone scammers are contacting local businesses and presenting themselves as representatives of Southern Power District.

“They are demanding immediate payment for accounts that are reported ‘past due,’” Doose said.

“Recipients of these calls are being told that their meter will be disconnected if they fail to pay their bill.”

While the surge of phone calls has been targeting businesses, Doose said SPD is urging all its customers, including residential customers, to “heed this word of caution and to be skeptical if you receive this type of phone call.”

“If you receive a phone call from a person claiming to be a representative of Southern Power District, hang up the phone and contact Southern at (800) 579-3019,” Doose said. ”We will verify for you the current status of your account. We also encourage you to contact local law enforcement if you receive such a call.”

Southern Power District’s accurate contact information can be found on its website at www.southernpd.com. Customers can also verify the current status of their account by reviewing account information on the district’s SmartHub online portal.

According to www.callersmart.com, utility scams are one of five telephone scams that are the more common holiday scams. The others deal with gift cards, charity drives, IRS debts and online dating.

Utility scams are a common scam throughout the winter months. Using caller ID spoofing, a scammer will call pretending to be from your electricity provider. The scammer will inform you that you owe money and they are going to cut the power if you do not pay up immediately.

To avoid falling for utility phone scams, ask the right questions. Ask the caller for their name, the amount that you supposedly owe and a number that you can call them back at. If that number doesn’t match the one they called you from, that is a major red flag.

If the caller asks you for information, such as your address, account or payment information, do not answer them. Instead, hang up and call your utility company directly from the number that is listed on its website. By calling the utility company directly, you can verify whether you actually owe anything and you can also let it know that a scammer is impersonating them. It’s also important to report scam calls like this to your state’s attorney general.

Capt. Jim Duering of the Grand Island Police Department said they receive calls from the public concerning telephone scammers.

“We can take a criminal complaint on a fraud scheme even if the suspect is not here or the party they called isn’t out of any money,” Duering said. “If they are looking for someplace to report it and they live inside the city limits they can call us.”

He said when they learn about scams, if it’s not isolated, they try to share the information with the public on the department’s social media pages, such as Twitter.

The Police Department has also launched a new web page that will contain information the department will share with the public on scams. The web page is www.gipolice.org. During office hours, the public can report a telephone scam or any other scam to the department by calling (308) 385-5400.

Duering also gave some advice on how to determine whether a call is legitimate.

“The first one, especially on phone scams, whoever they are reporting to be, tell them you will be calling them back on a publicly listed number,” he said. “Something in the Yellow Pages, if they still have a phone book, or they can look it up on a Google or White Pages search and call them back on a publicly listed number because I don’t know of any scammers who are so good that they can actually answer the phone of a legitimate business.”

Duering said if the scammer is asking you to send money, send it through certified mail and always call the party to make sure the bank accounts are right.

“It takes a couple of minutes to take a couple of steps and nine times out of 10 you will avoid the fraudulent activity,” he said.

Duering also advises not to give a credit card number or bank account number to anyone who has called you on the phone or contacted you by email.

“Phone numbers and emails are easily spoofed,” Duering said. “There are just too many programs. Enter an email address that you can get from a legitimate email page or a business card of a person you know or have personally contacted or just tell them you will call them back on a publicly listed number. Never give them anything during that initial phone call.”

Scammers have no idea most of the time who they are targeting. Duering said that the police chief recently received an email scam on his work email.

Phone scams are on the increase and a Saval woman was very lucky not to have been caught this week when a caller claiming they were from Danske Bank told her that her card had been added to Apple Pay and they wanted to remove it for her.

The lady wisely didn't give any information even though the caller seemed to know her and was able to give her full address. He told her he needed to send a text to her to confirm the removal.

"He stated that he needed confirmation to remove the card by sending a text."

The Co Down woman was so distracted with her baby in the background that she never read the text message properly when it came through and just gave the code to the caller.

As she explains "After I hung up I copped on....It was the verification to ADD it to Apple."

Realising the potential for fraud quickly she called Danske Bank and cancelled her card straight away and luckily wasn't out any money.

Commenting on her near miss the woman added "Just don't want it happening to anyone else. I don't have a clue where they got my details from"

The next time another unknown number unexpectedly rings your phone, send it straight to voicemail.

Or better yet, Pixel phone users can let their Google Assistant screen the call for them. The Google Assistant’s new call screening feature (built into the Pixel 3 phone debuting this month, and coming to the Pixel 1 and 2 in November) prompts you to tap “Screen call” when you get an incoming call from an unknown number. What’s more, the A.I. assistant will answer the call for you and send a transcript in real-time, so that you can decide whether to pick up or block it as spam.

Here’s how it works: The Google Assistant will answer the call for you, and an automated voice will alert the caller that you are “using a screening service from Google” and that you will receive a copy of this conversation. It will then ask them to state their name and reason for calling, which will be sent to you in real time. If the call sounds legit, you can: answer it or text a response (for example, “I’ll call you back later”). If it sounds sketchy or the scammer doesn’t identify themselves, then you can ignore the call, block the number and report it as spam.

Screening these calls is the safest way to weed out a legit caller from the scammers that spammed Americans with more than 30 billion robocalls in 2017 that cost consumers $350 million.

And it’s only going to get worse.

Half of all mobile calls are expected to be spam robocalls in 2019, according to call protection company First Orion, which analyzed data from 50 billion calls over the last 18 months. It found the percentage of spam phone calls has jumped from 3.7% of total calls in 2017 to 29.2% in 2018 — and it predicts that number will hit 44.6% by early 2019, and it will keep rising until half of all calls are spam by the year’s end.

“Year after year, the scam call epidemic bombards consumers at record-breaking levels, surpassing the previous year, and scammers increasingly invade our privacy at new extremes,” said Charles D. Morgan, CEO and Head Data Scientist of First Orion, in statement.

Spam call blocking service YouMail also reports that a record 4.2 billion robocalls blew up our phones in August 2018 alone, with the average person getting 7.7 unsolicited calls. And robocalls increased 33.2% to 28.5 billion calls in the first eight months of this year, compared to the 21.4 billion robocalls in the same period in 2017. And ironically, this increase is partly due to more people screening their calls; turns out, ignoring the robocalls spurs the scammers to place even more calls while trying to get through.

“The problem is, the technology making these robocalls is cheap and easy to make, so it’s a low barrier to entry,” Susan Grant, the director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, told Moneyish. “They obviously work often enough that more scammers keep entering the market. And it’s hard for law enforcement to go after every single robocall, because there are so many of them.” It is speculated that it costs just $0.01 for a spammer to place a spoofed spam call.

Clever con artists often try profiting off of topical subjects, like calling about donations following a national tragedy, such as powerful hurricanes like Florence and Michael, or a slew of phony IRS and debt collecting calls during tax season. They phish for your personal information, or get you to agree to buy shoddy products and accept fraudulent charges. And the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has warned that the calls asking, “Can you hear me?” or “Do you pay most of the bills in your home?” are probably trying to record you saying “Yes” to use your own voice against you in authorizing charges on a bill or a stolen credit card.

And while the FTC received 63,000 complaints about illegal robocalls each month in 2009, that number increased almost sixfold to 375,000 complaints a month last year. So the FCC created a Robocall Strike Force in 2016 to hang up the con artists. The team is trying to develop technology to pinpoint where these calls are coming from so that they can shut them down. It also adopted new rules earlier this year allowing phone companies to proactively block calls that are likely to be fraudulent, like appearing to be from area codes that do not exist. The FCC also began exploring ways to set up a reliable system to verify that a phone call is really coming from the phone number that it claims to be coming from to stop “neighborhood spoofing,” where scammers place calls that appear to be local because they have the same area code that you do.

“What people can do right now is use the tools that are being made available to them, and be very careful not to give personal information -- like your name, Social Security number or birth date - to somebody who calls them out of the blue, whether it’s a live call or not,” said Grant.

And here’s what else you can do to protect yourself in the meantime.
• REGISTER YOUR NUMBER: Register with the free National Do Not Call Registry if you haven’t already at donotcall.gov or 1-888-382-1222. This will stop the legit marketers from calling you within a month.
• DON’T PICK UP: When you get an unsolicited call from a number you don’t recognize, let it go to voicemail. Many spammers won’t leave a message. “I hate to say you that you can’t trust any callers these days, but you certainly have to be careful,” said Grant.
• NEVER SAY ‘YES’: If you do answer the suspicious call, or respond to a voice message from an unsolicited caller, do not answer “yes” or offer any personal information during the conversation. If the caller asks something like, “Are you the homeowner?” or “Can you hear me?” politely respond, “Where are you calling from, and why do you need this information?” The sooner you hang up after sensing a call is sketchy, there’s less of a chance you’ll let something slip.
• THE IRS, SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE DMV AREN’T CALLING YOU: Hang up if the caller claims to be from the IRS, Social Security, the DMV or a similar agency, as government officials will only ever reach out to you through the mail, unless you call them first. And many spam callers claim to be debt collectors for debit and credit cards, student loan offices, banks and retailers. Hang up and contact your bank, credit card company or loan office directly to see if they actually need something.
• CHECK FOR CHARGES: If you fear you’ve let something slip to a scammer, check your banking, credit card, phone and cable statements for unfamiliar charges. Call the billing company and dispute anything that you didn’t knowingly authorize. Demand proof if they claim you were recorded approving the charge. And you can also contact the Federal Trade Commission to dispute charges.
• SEE WHAT YOUR PROVIDER PROVIDES: Look into what spam and robocall controls your phone carrier provides to block unwanted and anonymous calls, like AT&T’s Call Protect, or T-Mobile’s Scam ID and Scam Block. “Most of these are free, so check your phone company’s website to see what’s available,” said Grant.
• THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT: If you don’t have a Pixel phone or use the Google Assistant, robocall-blocking apps are also popping up. Hiya, free for iOS and Android, flags potential scam calls, adds context to where unknown numbers might be to coming from and lets you report scam numbers in the app. Nomorobo for $1.99 a month on iOS works similarly to Hiya. Truecaller is a free iOS and Android app that alerts you to fraudulent calls before you pick up. And the free Should I Answer? app for Android crowdsources nuisance numbers, so users can warn each other about the worst unwanted call offenders.

And check out the FCC’s web resources for blocking robocalls.

In the wake of critical incidents in Ventura County the Ventura Police Department encourages residents to be aware of scams that often follow disasters. The scammers often play on the emotions of people especially during major incidents.

If you are asked to make a charitable donation, please consider these tips:
• Donate to charities you know and trust.
• Be alert for charities that seem to have sprung up overnight.
• Do not give out personal or financial information including your credit card or bank account number unless you know the charity is reputable.
• Be cautious about clicking on links in emails requesting a donation.
• Check out a charity before you donate by contacting the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance at 703-276-0100 or at website www.give.org

The community is also advised to be aware of additional phone scams that have impacted residents:
• IRS Scam: The scammer says money is owed and must be paid immediately by phone.
• Edison/Gas Scam: The scammer says money is owed and if not paid immediately the service will be turned off.
• Jury Duty Scam: The scammer says money is owed for not showing up to jury duty and if not paid jail time will occur.
• "Can You Hear Me" Scam: Scammers are calling victims hoping to get them to say the word "yes" during the conversation that's being recorded. The scammer will later use the recording of the victim saying yes to authorize unwanted charges on the victim's utility or credit card account.
• Text Message Phishing Scam: Scammers are using a new texting scam and spoofing banks' phone numbers and sending text messages to customers. A spoofed phone number hides the actual number the text is coming from and displays a number from a trusted source, like your bank. The text claims that your debit card has been used to make a purchase and if you do not recognize the transaction, you need to call their fraud prevention helpline. A phone number is provided for you to call. Because the incoming text looks like it's from your bank, people are falling for this. If you do call the number provided in the text, the fraudster will answer the phone. They will then ask you to confirm your sensitive banking details. This would allow the scammer to steal money from your account.
• Grandparent Scam: A scammer poses as a grandchild and claims to be in jail and in need of money for bail. These imposters claim they are in another state or out of the country and need money wired to help bail them out of jail.

The community is urged to be vigilant and aware of these scams to avoid falling victim. Never follow directions from someone on the phone that requests personal information or money. Please report phone and computer scams to the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP or visit ftc.gov/complaint.

The Fredericksburg Police Department is warning people about a terrifying phone scam where a caller claims to have kidnapped a child and demands money from parents.

FPD says a mother received a call stating that her daughter was being held for ransom, and that money needed to be electronically wired for her release.

Police say the woman went to a local H-E-B to attempt to make the transfer.

At the same time, Fredericksburg Police bike patrol officers located the girl and her friends downtown, safe and unaware of anything suspicious happening.



The girl was released to her mother without any incident.

The department is handling the investigation as a scam, and is urging the public to be aware of calls like this.

The Will County Sheriff’s Office is advising licensed physicians, that several doctors within the Will County area have received phone calls from an unknown individual who claims to be a ranking Sergeant or Lieutenant with the Sheriff’s Office. These individuals state that because the doctor did not show up for jury duty they will need to pay a fine or will be arrested. Some of the doctors who have made reports with us have stated that they were told that a Failure To Appear warrant had already been filed for their arrest. The Will County Sheriff’s Department wants to remind people that this is a scam. These scammers are aggressive and appear legitimate by using Docket numbers and other legal terms in order to scare the person into believing them. In some cases, the individuals threaten the doctor with having their doctor’s licenses pulled if they do not pay the fine. The phone numbers being used in the calls appear to be local callers, however, these phone numbers are fraudulent and untraceable. Neither the Sheriff’s Office nor the Jury Commission will ever call citizens regarding jury duty no-shows. You are advised to simply hang up the phone if you receive one of these calls.

A Queens grandmother was tricked out of $5,000 in a notorious phone scam, and police are looking for the man captured on video running off with the money from her home.

Police say the suspect called the 82-year-old victim at her home in Corona the afternoon of Thursday, Nov. 1, and told her that her grandson had been arrested and needed $5,000 bail money.

When the man showed up at her house, the grandmother turned over the cash, and he ran off with the money.

No one was hurt.

Anyone with information on the suspect, decribed as a heavyset and balding man in his 30s, last seen wearing dark eyeglasses and all-dark clothing, is asked to contact NYPD Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.

The caller said Erickson had two outstanding warrants costing $950 each for failing to report to jury duty.

Erickson said she believed the claim at first because she had received a questionnaire in the mail about federal jury duty.

"The timing having had that just happen, I kind of was like, 'oh my God, maybe this is legit' " said Erickson.

But it wasn't, which she soon found out when the caller threatened her with an arrest warrant.

"I think if you had a warrant they arrest you if they pull you over, but I'd never heard of somebody being called on their warrant, so that kind of was the first part of me thinking it's a scam," said Erickson.

So she called the scammers back, well aware of what was going on.

"Sergeant O'Connor Duluth Police Department what's going on now," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

After asking for Erickson's name, the scammer told her that she again had two citations for not showing up to jury duty.

"It's showing up on file that you were expected to serve on October 8, and you never showed up," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

To fix this, the scammer said Erickson should go to WalMart and buy a Department of Treasury card that she would then bring to the sheriff's office.

"We have to keep open lines of communication until you ride down here to the sheriff's department," the scammer told Erickson over the phone.

Erickson was fortunate she caught onto the scam, but says elderly people she works with could be more at risk.

"I can't tell you how many elderly people I have had crying in tears, who have fallen for stuff like this scam, and have given these people and done what they said because they're scared, and find out it's a scam," said Erickson.

But she stresses it's something that could happen to any of us.

"It does seem legit. Anybody could have had jury duty that didn't come in their mail or they misplaced it," said Erickson.

Duluth Police say this scam is targeting mental health professionals, but say they do not know why that is.

Erickson says she has heard of other people that have been the victim of it as well.

She says says the number they are calling from is 218-755-7371.

Duluth Police say the scammers are convincing as they set up caller ID's similar to that of DPD's. DPD says to never answer an unknown number, or provide any personal information.

They want to remind the public that they will never call and demand money.

If you receive a call like this you are asked to hang up and call 911.

Last month, Guy-Paul Larocque received a call from a man claiming to be a representative of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

The man claimed Larocque had qualified to receive a grant and needed to share some of his personal financial information before the payment would be released.

Although the man sounded “like a person of authority,” Larocque was suspicious. For one thing, Larocque is Canadian, not American, so how could he be eligible for money from the IRS?

The second red flag may have been even more telling: The call had gone to Larocque’s work phone. The work phone he uses as a sergeant on an RCMP team focused on protecting Canadians from phone scams.

Larocque decided not to let on that he knew the man on the other end of the phone was trying to scam him. He asked questions, and found the caller’s responses to be vague and evasive. Eventually, the supposed IRS agent hung up on him out of frustration.

“If a person is refusing to provide answers to very basic questions, it’s a good indication that it’s a scam,” Larocque said Wednesday.

Larocque was speaking at a press conference announcing the latest developments in the RCMP’s ongoing battle against the Indian call centres believed to be behind the Canada Revenue Agency scam.

The CRA scam typically takes the form of a phone call in which the recipient is told they owe money to the agency and are threatened with arrest if they do not pay. The scammers often try to receive their money via Bitcoin, gift cards, wire transfer or another unusual method of payment.

More than 74,000 complaints about the scam have been filed since the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre began tracking the activity in 2014. An estimated 4,000 Canadians have lost more than $15 million to the scam over the same time period.

None of that money is believed to have been recovered, and authorities believe there are many more victims who have never reported the crimes to police.

One blow was struck against the scammers in 2016 when a 750-employee call centre in India was busted. Several arrests were made there, as well as about a dozen in Canada.

The RCMP reported at the time that the arrests had led to a “significant decrease” in the number of reports of CRA scams.

Since then, though, the reports have returned.

“It is a large problem for Canadians as well as the Indian government,” RCMP Supt. Peter Payne said at Wednesday’s press conference.

Police have responded in kind. Three call centres in India were raided “over the past few weeks,” Payne said, with “several fraudsters” arrested.

Authorities did not have information on exactly how many people were arrested or where in India the call centres were located, but did say that officers were able to seize a spreadsheet containing information about more than 600 Canadian victims.

“The takedown of the call centres has been important for disruption of fraudulent scams which affect Canadians,” Payne said.

Speakers at the press conference said enforcement was unlikely to ever bring CRA scams to a complete halt, because the people behind them are able to shift their tactics to stay ahead of detection.

Paine said one such change has even taken place in the past few years, with the large-scale call centres like the one busted in 2016 replaced by smaller shops employing “maybe a dozen or 15 people.”

The officials stressed that the most effective tool to curb the spread of the scam is through education.

“We know that other call centres will spring up … but if we can really focus on prevention to educate people what is a fraud, then that will be better,” Larocque said through a French translator.

Newcomers to Canada are often said to be more at risk of becoming victims of the CRA scam. Payne said the RCMP are looking at expanding their anti-scam education efforts into languages other than English and French.

If you receive a voicemail informing you that you are the subject of a law suit, do not respond.

The message, in a robotic sounding voice, threatens that if you don’t call back a warrant will be issued for your arrest.

Authorities have reported that the tax scam threatens vulnerable people if they call the number back.

News.com.au reported that the number was 08 6102 5755 but that the number has now been discarded.

Since July 1, the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) has received 28,000 reports of attempted scams.

The following words “As per our recent audit, we have identified incorrect sorted tax filings, and we regret to inform you that your account has been marked delinquent on account of tax avoidance” were identified as the script for a scam email that again urged tax-payers to pay off debt.

In sharing the scam voicemail, Consumer Affairs Victoria hopes to remind people that the ATO will never:
• ask you to pay money to receive a refund or payment;
• ask you to provide personal information, including your tax file number and credit card details, via SMS or email;
• ask you to pay money into a personal bank account;
• direct you to download files from the internet or open attachments on unsolicited emails.

If you receive a suspicious call or email claiming to be from the ATO, you can verify the caller or sender by contacting the ATO on 1800 008 540.

Olympic swimmer Rowdy Gaines is issuing a warning after his family almost became victims of a virtual kidnapping scam when they received a disturbing phone call from a stranger saying his daughter was being held hostage.

The terrifying ordeal began Saturday when Gaines' daughter, Madison, received a phone call from a woman pretending to be with the "Colorado Police Department," the college student said in a lengthy Facebook Live video posted Monday.

Madison said the woman told her she had a warrant out for her arrest because she didn't appear in court for a summons and then gave her an address in Colorado, where she attends college, to drive towards.

Unaware that the woman on the phone was not really with a police department, Madison drove to the address, which was a Walmart. Madison was then instructed to buy a pre-paid card and take money out of an ATM.

While Madison was being directed to another location and on the phone with the woman, her parents received a phone call from a man pretending to have her hostage. Madison said the two somehow were able to get her and her parents on a three-way call.

"I could hear my dad. I could tell he was on the phone," she said. "I could hear my dad yelling at these people."

In a Facebook post, Gaines explained that the man who called him and his wife, Jude Zachea Gaines, demanded he drive to a nearby store and wait for instructions on what to do. He said during the call, the man threatened to kill Madison and then himself.

The couple was eventually able to alert the police, who told them the kidnapping was not real and the people they were talking to were scammers.

"Our hope is this post will help others have a shield to these types of scams and create an awareness to others," Gaines posted.

Virtual kidnapping scams have been around for almost two decades. FBI Los Angeles Special Agent Erik Arbuthnot said in a 2017 report that it started happening more in the United States in 2015 and scammers typically choose various cities and will then cold-call "hundreds of numbers until innocent people fell for the scheme."

The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department is warning the public of a scam involving phone calls from suspects falsely claiming to be members of the department, asking for money.

The SDSO said scammers have recently been targeting residents of Poway and surrounding communities.

Here’s how the scam plays out: an unknown person will call a potential victim, claiming the person they have called has a warrant for their arrest and owes money to the SDSO.

The impersonators try to cover their bases to look legitimate, sometimes giving the victim a real phone number belonging to the SDSO. At times, they have also used names of real employees that work for the department.

The SDSO said the scammers sometimes even try to arrange a meeting in the parking lot of a government building of sheriff’s station to add to the ruse.

The department said Friday that these calls are never the real deal. The SDSO, the County of San Diego, or any of its employees will never contact the public via telephone to solicit money in the manner.

“Nor would any employees ever try to arrange a meeting to allow the ‘payment’ to be made,” the SDSO said.

The scam calls are under investigation. Anyone who gets a phone call like this should immediately hang up and report the incident to the Federal Trade Commission by clicking here.

The SDSO said victims who suffer a financial loss due to one of these scam calls can call the Sheriff’s Communication Center at (858) 565-5200 or the law enforcement agency that oversees their community.

ST. GEORGE — Cedar City Police issued a warning Friday that the police department’s number is being used by fraudsters calling residents impersonating a family member to demand bail money or other help, a scam designed to separate residents from their money.

The Cedar City Police Department’s primary phone number has been “spoofed,” Lt. Jimmy Roden told St. George News Friday morning.

Spoofing is when a caller deliberately falsifies the information sent to the would-be victim’s caller I.D. in an attempt to trick them into giving the fraudster either money or personal information.

“We started receiving calls yesterday reporting that someone is calling these people claiming they calling from here, and when they call the number back it comes back to the police department.”

In the scam the caller pretending to be a family member tells the would-be victim they are in jail and need bail money to be released, or a similar scenario where a relative is claiming they need help or financial assistance.

However, the “send me money” request is a universal element in the scam, Roden said.

He added that similar scams are taking place in other police departments all over the country, and this is not a new scam, but one that has made a return.

“These types of scams have been going on for years, and it’s back.”

The Cedar City Police Department, or any police agency for that matter, does not call demanding payment of fines or bail.

“Don’t become a victim,” Roden said. “We would never contact you and ask for money to be sent or delivered, to help or aid your family member who is in custody.”

Fines are collected by the courts, and warrants are served by law enforcement and never issued over the phone.

Anyone receiving a similar call should just hang up and call the family member directly if in doubt, Roden said, but do not send any cash, Western Union transfers or gift/cash cards.

In the United States, caller ID spoofing is generally illegal if it’s done “with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value,” according to the relevant federal statute, the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009, which does make exceptions for certain law-enforcement purposes.

Customers are being advised to contact AIB if they have received suspicious calls

AIB have warned customers of two potential scams after reports of bogey phone calls that could lead online bank accounts to be compromised.

The bank urged customers to get in touch if they had received any suspicious phone calls from someone pretending to work for a particular body.

Crooks are phoning up AIB customers and claiming to be in a position of authority to tell them their internet connection has been subject to criminal activity.

The bank posted advice on their website, saying: “Two of the current scams in circulation are where fraudsters are calling our customers claiming to be a Law enforcement official; e.g. National Crime Agency/Europol/Interpol, advising you that your Broadband has been compromised, your identity has been stolen and your PC is being used for criminal purposes; e.g. drug trafficking/money laundering.

“They will ask you to assist them by making payments that they claim they will track to identify criminals.

“The callers may advise you not to disclose this information to law enforcement/bank staff.”

Scammers are also believed to be contacting customers posing as phone and internet providers, or from a software company in order to gain access to their computer.

They will attempt to coax sensitive information from unsuspecting people and use this to access their online bank accounts.

The AIB statement continues: “A Telephone/Mobile phone provider, broadband provider or software company, offering to ‘fix’ PC or broadband problems.

“The callers will attempt to trick you into giving them your banking or card credentials and provide codes from your card reader, in order to access your online banking and make fraudulent payments.”

“You may be asked to allow the caller to take remote control of your PC in order to ‘assist’ you, however, this could allow the fraudster to show you fraudulent screens.

“The callers are professional and will be able to transfer you to their ‘supervisor’ should you request this. They sound genuine.”

Finally, AIB are advising their customers to never reveal any information in relation to their card readers or Personal Access Codes (PAC).

“NEVER disclose codes from your AIB Card Reader over the phone.

“NEVER disclose the full five digits of your Personal Access Code (PAC).

“If you have received such a call and disclosed any of your Banking details, please contact us immediately.”

Once the fraudsters behind online scams claimed to be princes from far-away lands, but they’re much more sophisticated now and much harder to spot, warns Jane Bradley.

The other day, my friend answered a call to her mobile phone and received a nasty shock. “Hello,” said the voice on the other end. “I’m calling from HMRC. There have been indications that you have committed tax fraud between 2012 and 2017. You owe more than £6,000.”

My friend was more than slightly concerned. The fact that the call had come just days after she had submitted her self-assessment tax return to HM Revenue and Customs for this year tipped her towards believing that this nightmare could possibly be true.

When she quickly checked the number which displayed on her phone screen during the call against the legitimate number cited by HMRC on its own website, they matched. When they called her back a few hours later, it again, appeared to be a call from the real HMRC number. The voice continued to tell her that the tax authorities were pressing serious charges against her and had a warrant for her arrest. They had case numbers and ID numbers. They asked her repeatedly if she had been aware of the fraud, or if it had been done without her knowledge.

They told her that she needed to hire a tax lawyer – or pay the full amount immediately. It was then that she became suspicious and hung up.

During the call, she spoke to a number of different people and all were equally plausible and knowledgable about the situation. As my friend has been predominently a stay-at-home parent for a while, but has small amounts of money coming in from a variety of different sources, she was concerned that somehow she might have been overlooking a payment she needed to make for years. She was pretty certain that she hadn’t – and hires a reliable accountant to manage her tax affairs – but suddenly, at seven months pregnant and alone in the house, she felt uncertain. And vulnerable – which is what the scammers play on. It seems that scams – and pretty sophisticated ones at that – are on the rise. The Annual Fraud Indicator from Action Fraud estimates the cost of fraud to the UK is £190 billion a year.

Previously, scams were limited to badly spelled emails claiming that an African prince was in need of help and needed thousands of pounds to be transferred to his bank account immediately. You could spot those a mile off. But the latest round are far more sophisticated.

The fact that the scammers could somehow alter their displayed phone number to match that of the real HMRC is terrifying – this is a fairly new addition known as “phone spoofing”. Yet it is not unusual.

John MacKenzie, partner at law firm Shepard and Webberburn in Edinburgh, tells me that scams are becoming increasingly intricate, tricking even the most canny of consumers. “The scams are getting more and more sophisticated, and more and more concerning for the individual user or business,” he said. “The quality of the emails is getting better and so it’s difficult to, at a glance, pick out a scam.”

As well as faking phone numbers in calls, fraudsters can also replicate mobile numbers in text messages sent to consumers – which they then believe to be from their bank – as they appear on the same text message conversation as legitimate messages from the customer’s financial institution. Using advanced technology, the scammers insert special meta data into the transmission of the text message – so that, although it looks like it has come from the bank’s number, it has not.

READ MORE: Scam warning: the fake TV Licensing emails designed to steal your bank details

Just this week, consumers were warned to be on the lookout for fraudulent messages claiming to be from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DLVA). The government agency, which overseas matters such as driving licences and vehicle tax has issued a warning over emails and text messages that appear to be from it asking for personal information such as bank details. Another legitimate-looking email, this time purporting to be from the TV Licensing people, has also been doing the rounds.

I got it myself and had to do a double take before I realised what it was. “We’re sorry to let you know that the TV license could not be automatically renewed,” it said. “Something has gone wrong with your payment.” I did think for a split second that it could be real. One way to quickly identify a scam is to take a look at the email address it has come from. While the inital name which flashes up on the top of the email may seem legit, the actual address may be very different. In the case iof the email I was sent, it was nothing to do with TV licensing at all and was instead, a strange-sounding personal address.

What is interesting about both the scam my friend almost fell for and the TV Licensing one is that they both link back to a legitimate website. My friend was told HMRC’s web address over the phone. When she checked it, of course, it was the real site. Yet because it wasn’t asking her to do anything via the site, that made no difference.

Mackenzie’s advice is clear: “Pay attention to your bank or the relevant authority,” he says. “If they say they do not ever ask you to transfer money online, anyone who does is not legitimate.” Listen to the man – and be on your guard.

Consumers are being warned not to be caught out by phone scams from far-flung destinations such as Antarctica that could leave them with a huge bill.

UAE residents reported receiving a series of calls from Antarctica, the tiny Pacific island of Nauru and Luxembourg in the past week.

Experts have warned phone users against returning missed phone calls from overseas numbers they don't recognise.

Users can be charged up to $50 per minute if they return the call.

Dubbed the Wangiri scam, those behind the scam have targeted phone users across the globe. Wangiri translates to ‘one ring and cut’ in Japan, where it first began.

Indian consulate warns fraudsters are using its name for a scam

Philip Hitchcox, 38, the leasing director for a Dubai property agency, received missed calls from Antarctica and Nauru - both established hubs for the scam - along with South Korea and Grand Prairie in Texas in the past week.

"At least with Antarctica, it's so unusual that you can tell it must be some sort of scam," he said.

"But people could be taken in by some of the other destinations. You do get calls from all over the world when working here."

"You do get a lot of unsolicited calls from companies here, for offers and upgrades, but I knew this must be something more suspect so I didn't answer," said the construction sector employee, who asked that her surname not be used.

"You do hear of scams that charge you by the minute, and of WhatsApp offers with dodgy links and so on."

Other social media users living in Dubai also shared images on Facebook and Twitter of missed calls from Antarctica.

The phone calls are usually disconnected after a few rings prompting the receiver to call back.

The method used by fraudsters involves routing people who ring back to a premium rate number. The callers are unable to disconnect as they are locked into an automated recorded message until it runs out after a few minutes.

The scam works by keeping the caller on the phone for a prolonged period connected to premium rate numbers.

The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority has urged residents to file any complaints with the service providers directly.

Both du and Etisalat have told residents to phone customer care services if they suspected hoax calls.

Residents have previously been targeted by fraudsters who promise to award them large sums of money while asking for bank details and personal information.

In a public advisory, du asked customers not to entertain calls from people they did not know, to be aware of fraudulent calls and to decline to divulge bank details.

TUCSON, Ariz. - The Tucson Police Department says it has received several reports of a well-known phone scam.

TPD says a caller is pretending to be a family member in trouble or distress. Another person then takes the phone and says they have kidnapped the family member and a ransom must be paid. Police say the caller ID often shows an out of area phone number, but those can be spoofed to look like it came from a more local area.

The person on the other end of the phone is given information on how to obtain prepaid cards or other means of sending amounts of $5,000 or more.

TPD says if someone happens to get this call, a phone call to the family member can often reassure the victim. Victims can also ask questions that only the real family member would know to the scammers, such as names of other family members or pets.

A 54-year-old former West Palm Beach man on Thursday pleaded guilty to multiple charges in connection with a sophisticated scheme to steal personal information about cell phone users to clone their numbers to make illicit profits.

Braulio DelaCruz Vasquez, who was picked up in his native Dominican Republic in August, pleaded guilty to wire fraud, credit card fraud, aggravated identity theft and other charges. He faces a mandatory two-year prison term when he is sentenced in U.S. District Court in Miami on Jan. 18.

The 2016 investigation, dubbed “Operation Toll Free” by FBI agents, netted five arrests. A sixth man, Edgar Estarlin Peralta Lopez, remains at large. The others — Edwin Fana, Farintong Calderon, Jose Santana and Ramon Batista — are serving prison terms ranging from 36 to 75 months.

DelaCruz operated a call center from his West Palm home, federal prosecutors said. After his co-conspirators had stolen personal information from cell phone users’ accounts, DelaCruz would reprogram the phones and make thousands of calls over the internet. Many of the calls were routed to Cuba, Jamaica and other countries with high calling charges, prosecutors said.

The calls were billed to customer accounts. DelaCruz received “tens of thousands of dollars” from a Voice over Internet Protocol company for fraudulently routing international calls through his call center, prosecutors said.

BENTON COUNTY, Mo. - The Benton County Sheriff's Office is warning area residents about a recent scam call.

The scam callers are claiming that the residents have warrants out for their arrest, according to a Benton County Sheriff's Office Facebook post.

The phone number residents have been called from by scammers is 479-709-3601.

The scammers allegedly go on to say that the residents have missed jury duty and must pay money to avoid being arrested. Some scammers even attempt to get residents to meet in the sheriff's office parking lot to make a payment.

CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. — Chambersburg police are warning of a telephone scam in which the caller claims to be a representative of Shell Oil Co. advising the person who takes the call that he or she won a substantial amount of money.

"In an attempt to legitimize the scam, the caller tells the individual to contact attorney John Donavan with Ropes and Gray Law Firm out of New York City. Another number is provided for the attorney. When called, another individual answers the phone and pretends to be attorney John Donavan," police said in a news release.

The person purporting to be Donavan tells the scam victim that he or she would owe the law firm $5,000 to obtain legal counsel before winnings could be claimed, the release said. The money was to be transferred by wire service.

Police said they talked to an attorney with the same law firm. That person said his firm has been dealing with the scam for about a week.

"Attorney Donavan does not represent Shell Oil Co. in any way," the release said.

SANTA CLARA, CA -- Santa Clara police arrested a Fremont man for allegedly trying to bilk the elderly by posing as someone with privileged information about a family member.

The police department was tipped off to the nationwide scheme by the Richland County Sheriff's Office in Montana when it said a 77-year-old resident in the state fielded a call from an unknown party who was trying to convince the victim that his grandson had been arrested and needed bail money. Over the course of several days, the victim was instructed to send over $20,000 to an address in Santa Clara.

Investigators set up surveillance at the pick-up location where they later observed Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla, 24, of Fremont arrive. He was detained and later arrested. During the probe, it was determined Kotla bilked four victims out of $28,000. He is believed to be an operational member in a list of national phone scams involving Medicare, prescription drugs, funderals, anti-aging products, investments, sweepstakes, contests, lotteries, mortgages, home improvement, IRS/taxes and utility services.

When in doubt, residents are asked to call the police department at 408-615-4700.

Peterborough police say three more residents have lost thousands of dollars after falling victim to the Canada Revenue Agency phone scam.

Two incidents happened on Monday, police say. In one case, a 24-year-old woman received a voice message on her cell, stating she owed the CRA around $8,000 from two years ago and that there was an ongoing investigation into her debt. The message indicated she would be arrested for her outstanding debt.

Police say the woman informed the called she only had $4,000 but could repay the full amount later. However, the caller said she needed to repay the full amount on that day or face arrest.

As a result, the woman withdrew a $4,000 loan from a MoneyMart and then purchased $8,000 in BitCoins and sent a QR code to complete the transaction, police said. A family member later informed her she was likely a victim of fraud and she then called police.

Also on Monday, police say a 27-year-old woman received a similar call, stating she had to pay $5,000 to the CRA. Police say this woman sent $5,000 through BitCoin to an unknown person. She later called police to report the incident after she realized she had been scammed.

Earlier this month, police say a 57-year-old man also received a call from someone claiming to be a police officer investigating on behalf of the CRA.

“As a result of the phone call, the victim purchased $2,000 in Google Play gift cards and sent the fake officer the serial numbers on the cards in order to pay his fake debt,” police stated.

Det. Const. Keith Calderwood with the police service’s fraud unit says scammers are aggressive and relentless.

“They are targeting everyone and anyone, regardless of gender or age,” he said.

“If you get a call from someone you don’t know stating you owe money and threatening your arrest, stop, pause and think. Hang up, call a trusted friend or family member and call your bank.”

Calderwood notes the CRA will not ask for payment in the form of BitCoins, gift cards or prepaid credit cards.

“They will not threaten arrest or send a police officer to your home,” he said.

If believed to have been victimized by a scam, police advise residents to report the incident to the Peterborough Police Service or its online reporting system.

Tyler Cooper, 26, of 117 Evansville St., reported a suspected IRS scam to officers of the Bellefontaine Police Department shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday.

He called police after becoming suspicious of a phone call received about 5 p.m. from an individual that “sounded foreign” and claimed to be an IRS agent. The suspected scammer threatened an arrest warrant against Cooper for allegedly having failed to comply with IRS requirements.

Cooper then provided the caller with a full name, address birth date and Social Security number. The suspicious telephone number was (219) 512-9200, police report.

Cooper late contacted the IRS office directly and confirmed he was actually in compliance.

The IRS will never contact taxpayers by telephone demanding payment without having first submitted a bill; it would never ask for a credit or debit card information over the phone; and the IRS would never threaten to contact local authorities and threaten to have an individual arrested for having not paid, according to the official government Web site, irs.gov.

“These telephone scams are being seen in every part of the country, and we urge people not to be deceived by these threatening phone calls,” according to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

“We have formal processes in place for people with tax issues. The IRS respects taxpayer rights, and these angry, shake-down calls are not how we do business.”

A 24-year-old Fremont man was arrested Wednesday in connection with a phone scam targeting elderly residents across the country, Santa Clara police said Friday.

Police in Richland, Montana, contacted Santa Clara police on Wednesday to tell them a 77-year-old man had been instructed to send $20,000 in bail money for his grandson to a Santa Clara address.

Officers set up surveillance at the pickup location and saw Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla arrive and retrieve the package at 6:04 a.m., police said. Kotla was detained and later arrested.

Police identified four other victims during their investigation and retrieved $28,000 in cash from the suspect's home. Kotla is believed to be a member of a group which targets and runs scams on elderly residents.

Police said residents should be wary of calls demanding money over the phone and call police at (408) 615-4700 when in doubt.

CAMDEN COUNTY - A lake-area fire district is warning of a phone scam asking for donations.

The Tri-County Fire Protection District posted to Facebook on Saturday warning of a person making calls asking for donations for the fire district's Christmas Ball.

The post said the caller spoofed the fire district's caller ID to give the appearance the calls are coming from its phone number.

The district, which serves portions Camden, Laclede and Pulaski counties, said it is not holding any fundraiser related to the one mentioned in the calls.

The district said it would never ask for donations over the phone or via email. It asks people to not donate if they receive one of the calls.

SANTA CLARA — Police have arrested a man suspected of belonging to a national phone scam that bilked elderly people out of thousands of dollars by conning them in to believing their grandchildren were in trouble and needed large sums of cash fast.

Vamshidhar Reddy Kotla, 24, of Fremont, was booked at the Santa Clara County jail on suspicion of money laundering, forgery, conspiracy and grand theft, according to Santa Clara police. But jail records did not show anyone in custody under Kotla’s name, suggesting that he posted bail.

Authorities say Kotla came to police’s attention in Montana when the Richland County Sheriff’s Office were investigating a case with a 77-year-old man claiming to be a scam victim in Sydney, Montana. The man told deputies that an unidentified person called and convinced him that his grandson had been arrested and needed bail money.

“Over the course of several days and phone calls, the victim was instructed to send over $20,000 to an address in Santa Clara,” police said.

Richland County investigators contacted Santa Clara police, which sent officers to the cash pickup location provided by the victim. Wednesday, officers secretly watching the spot saw Kotla pick up a package linked to the suspicious phone call, and arrested him.

The ensuing investigation into Kotla turned up more packages containing cash from three other presumed victims in California, police said. In total, officers recovered more than $28,000 in cash.

Investigators contend that Kotla was part of a larger group that preys on elderly people with an array of phone scams that have leveraged fears about issues including Medicare, prescription drugs, funerals, investments, lotteries, mortgages, the IRS and utilities.

Santa Clara police offered some precautionary measures people can take to help avoid becoming the victims of these kinds of schemes.

“Instead of engaging with someone who has contacted you, hang up and initiate a call to the companies you interact with via the phone number on your bill (or) statement,” police said in a news release. “Residents are encouraged to be wary of phone calls where the caller is requesting money to be sent.”

Police also directed those looking for more information about elder scams to a web page by the California Attorney General’s Office at oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/seniors.

Dubuque County authorities said they have received multiple reports of phone scammers posing as deputies threatening to arrest residents unless they purchase gift certificates.

The Dubuque County Sheriff’s Department sent out a press release Wednesday afternoon warning residents about the scam.

Callers reported being contacted by a sheriff’s department employee who informed them of an “outstanding warrant,” the release stated. The scammer then advised purchasing iTunes cards and gift certificates to satisfy the bond on the arrest warrant.

“This is just a quick reminder to the area citizens that the Dubuque County Sheriff’s Office does not accept iTunes cards or gift certificates as forms of payment,” authorities stated in the release. “We also do not notify individuals that a warrant has been issued for them, unless that arrangement has been verbally discussed previously with the offender.”

Phone numbers used in the scam include 563-349-7849, 563-326-8625 and 563-235-9496. If you purchased and sent iTunes cards or gift certificates, contact authorities.

An Edmonton couple is out $175, and say it could have been thousands of dollars, after falling victim to what’s known as the fat finger scam. Sharon and Yves Baril are sharing their story in hopes of warning others.

On Monday afternoon, Sharon, 64, called the customer service number on the back of her Scotiabank bank card in hopes of getting information about her account balance.

The person on the other end of the line told her she had won a cruise to Bermuda for being a loyal bank customer; Yves, 71, has held the account since he was 18.

“Somebody answers saying, ‘Congratulations, you just won a cruise.’ All fancy and everything,” Sharon said. “They made it sound so good.”

The person told them that they would have to pay for their own flights to Florida, along with $130 for a hotel room and food before boarding the cruise. But after that, everything would be paid for.

Sharon gave the person her bank card number and the number on the back of her card. But then, the person on the other end of the phone continued to sweeten “the deal.” They said for an extra $1,200 they could stay for another two weeks.

The couple said they asked their son to help them check their bank balance online, but within minutes of hanging up the phone, $175 was gone. Yves immediately went to the bank where he was told he had fallen victim to a scam.

“They said, ‘No, there’s no promotion for that,'” Yves explained.

“They told me I wasn’t the only one. I go to the same girl all the time, the teller, and she said I’m not the only one, she said it’s been going on a couple days now.”

The scam is referred to as “fat finger dialing.” Scammers are buying up phone numbers similar to the customer support lines of major companies in hopes of fooling customers who have misdialled, according to the Better Business Bureau.

The scammer on the other end of the line offers free giveaways, such as prizes and gift cards. Because the customer has dialled the number themselves, they assume the gift offer must be the real deal so they stay on the line to speak to the representative.

The BBB said scammers will often ask for personal information such as your name, address and banking or credit card information in order to process the gift. Scammers are impersonating a wide range of organizations from banking and credit institution, to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to Walmart.

Watch below: The Better Business Bureau is warning consumers about some of the top scams making the rounds this fall.

Seanna Lawrence, president and CEO of the BBB in central and northern Alberta, said the scam has been prevalent in North America for the past couple of years. While her BBB location hasn’t received any recent local reports of the scam, she said it isn’t uncommon.

If people suspect the offer is too good to be true, Lawrence encourages them to hang up the phone. If it’s a legitimate offer, they can always call back. In addition, she said to keep an ear out for offers that are more than just nominal rewards.

“A cruise is a great example because that is something that’s exorbitant,” she said. “Or if there’s a 50 per cent discount, some kind of massive discount or reward, that’s the best indicator that you should do some further research.”

Lawrence said companies that are being targeted will often have alerts posted on their websites. She said people should never give out their credit card or banking information because their institution would already have that information.

Scotiabank would not say if the bank has been hit by this particular scam recently or how many people may have been affected by the scam.

“The number and sophistication of phishing and fraud attempts have increased globally,” Scotiabank spokesperson Brynne Moore said in a statement.

“The safety and security of our customers and their accounts are a top priority for the bank. No bank is immune to these threats and both the customer and the bank have responsibilities to protect their information. We encourage our customers to report any suspicious activity immediately to the bank, as well as to the appropriate authorities.”

Sharon said she feels like “a dummy” for giving out her banking information, but wanted to share her story in hopes of warning others.

The Barils also reported the incident to the Edmonton Police Service’s fraud unit. The couple said their bank account will be cancelled and they will be issued a new card.

People who fall victim to fraud are asked to report it to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.

(WXYZ) - For many Metro Detroiters, it began with a ring but ended in heartbreak.

We’ve tracked countless victims in our area falling for malicious phone scams, often preying on your fear.

We met Kelly Hamlin back in April after she forked over a thousand dollars in gift cards to someone she thought was an IRS agent.

With 127 complaints in the last three years, the BBB says IRS imposters are the top phone scam.

"Take a second, listen to who it is and recognize immediately that the IRS is never gonna call you. They’re not gonna ask for (gift) cards," said Melanie Duquesnel of the Better Business Bureau serving Metro Detroit.

Then there’s the one that preys on your hope of winning cash. The scammer sends you a hefty check, then asks you to send money back in taxes.

Once you send the money, you realize the check you cashed has bounced and is bogus.

Don’t expect to win any money if you’ve never entered a contest. With 120 complaints in the last three years, the BBB says the lottery or prize phone scam takes the second spot.

And rounding out the top three, with 85 complaints, is the warranty scheme, such as when a scammer calls you with an offer to put a warranty on your newly purchased car.

"Trying to say hey the transmission is gonna fail or the breaks are gonna fail, and this is gonna cover it," said Duquesnel.

Don’t take the bait, she adds, a cheap deal is a sign that it’s a fake deal.

And if you’ve been scammed, 7 Action News wants to hear from you. You can send an email to wxyz.com and report it to the BBB immediately, at BBB.org.

The Centralia Police Department has seen three instances of a Craigslist-based scam in the past week, prompting officers to encourage anyone entering an online transaction to confirm a solicitor is legitimate before money changes hands.

Similar schemes have cropped up in other areas, Sgt. Tracy Murphy said, but it seems to be relatively new for Centralia.

Each local report has had a common thread. A scammer takes information from real for-sale home postings, and then place a new ad on Craigslist, listing the house as an available rental and changing the contact phone number.

The scammers have conducted the fraudulent transactions over phone or email, where they send fake rental agreements and collect deposits online or over the phone. Then they bail on the transaction before any sort of face-to-face meeting would take place, pocketing the cash.

“If you’re going to check out a house, you should meet somebody there to do a walkthrough. You should do paperwork with them,” said Murphy.

If a deal seems too good to be true, then it’s probably not legit, Murphy added.

“They’re asking for just enough to make it enticing,” he said.

Arrests in such cases are unlikely, said Murphy, because the scammer could potentially be anywhere. It would require the police department to trace an online IP address to a location and then the person at that IP address who conducted the actual scam.

If someone is moving to a new area, and doesn’t have the chance to walk through a house and meet the solicitor in person before the move, Murphy recommended having someone you know or have contact with take a look, and make sure the solicitor is legitimate.

Scams, either online or over the phone, are nothing new. Lewis County Sheriff’s Office Field Operations Chief Bruce Kimsey said phone scammers often try to target elderly victims.

The sheriff’s office has been investigating an ongoing phone scam involving a person claiming to be a specific deputy, and requesting money.

Kimsey said his name has been used a number of times in the scam.

“I am truly bothered someone would try to use my name to try to defraud someone,” Kimsey told The Chronicle.

Likely, scammers will glean names of law enforcement officers from press releases shared on social media, and makes calls to numbers in the agencies jurisdiction. There have been six or seven reports filed with the sheriff’s office of this particular type of attempted fraud.

No deputy will call citizens to request money, said Kimsey, who advised it’s best not to give information over the phone if you’re not positive who you’re speaking with, or if the situation seems suspicious.

The Department of Homeland Security advises to contact local authorities if you find you’ve been the victim of a cybercrime.

If you get a phone call from the Social Security Administration, officials from the Federal Trade Commission have some advice: Hang up.

The FTC has warned of a new "spoofing" scam, where scammers who call your phone mimic (or "spoof") the SSA's 1-800 customer service number to trick you into handing over personal information.

According to Lisa Weintraub Schifferle, an attorney with the FTC, the scam works like this:

When your phone rings, your caller ID shows it's the SSA calling from 1-800-772-1213. Then the caller says he or she is with the administration and needs your personal information (like your Social Security number) to increase your benefits or to prevent them from being cut off.

More: Charity call to 'Help the Vets' was a scam, and so were many others, says FTC

The 1-800 number is the SSA's real number, but the call is fake, Schifferle said in a release. The scammers are "spoofing" the number, essentially tricking your caller ID into making the call appear genuine.

Real SSA employees will never threaten you or promise to increase you benefits in exchange for information, she said.

If you get a call like this, hang up immediately.

If you are in doubt, hang up anyway and call the SSA back directly at itscustomer service line, Schifferle said.

More: Beware of these scams

"If you dial that number, you know who you're getting," she said.

If you receive a call you suspect is fake, FTC officials encourage you to report it to the SSA's Office of the Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271, or visit https://oig.ssa.gov/report. You can also report these calls to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.

Yesterday, Nov. 14, I received a telephone call from a young man who claimed to be my grandson, Devin. The voice sounded somewhat like Devin but, when he explained his plight, I could understand that stress was causing him to be greatly upset.

He said he was in jail because he’d had an accident Tuesday night. He insisted the other driver had caused the accident when she ran a red light. When the police came to investigate, “Devin” agreed to a breathalyzer test which showed an alcohol level .01% over the limit. He was arrested and his car (with his cell phone in it) was impounded.

His bond was set at $4,800 cash. He gave me a phone number for the public defender, John Williams, I should contact to arrange payment. When I tried to call that number, I got the beeps that indicate an incoming call. I took that and, lo and behold, it was Mr. Williams telling me exactly how to send the bail payment.

The story kept getting weirder: Mr. Williams was in Rock County, Wisconsin, but I was to send the money to his attorney partnership organization in New York state. I agreed to call him back after I withdrew the funds from the bank.

When I got off the phone, I intended to look up Devin’s cell phone number on our computer but I heard my wife talking on the phone. She was talking to Devin on his cell phone. He was at his job in Ann Arbor and, of course, was totally unaware of any problem of any kind.

A quick search of the two phone numbers I was given show both are well known and flagged as scam contacts (thank goodness for Google).

This incident didn’t cost me any money but I can certainly see where someone less computer savvy and less cynical than I could get hurt badly.

Some people in the Greater Morgantown Area have been getting some interesting calls over the last week.

Scam artists, now posing as one of the Monongalia County Sheriff's Office's own deputies. Deputy Bise, but it's not the real Deputy Bise.

"Some of the victims were called and said that this was Deputy Bise, which we do have a deputy name Bise, and that they missed jury duty and they needed to pay a fine," said Sheriff Perry Palmer.

Palmer says phone scams typically come in cycles and when a new one comes along people need to be aware.

He says this time, someone fell victim.

"One person that did report it to us did go get them money and they were able to con him," said Palmer.

These scammers are asking you to get a green dot card, put money on it and to call back with the pin number.

When scammers get someone to do this, it's their lucky day.

"These people, if they can get two or three people out of 100 calls to actually give them some money, then they've had a good day," said Palmer.

This is the first time Palmer has heard of someone using a deputy's name and they're calling about a range of things.

"Missing jury duty to your loved one needs bail money to you have a warrant or citation," said Palmer.

Police departments do not solicit for tickets or warrants. Anything like this will go through the court system.

Palmer also says nine times out of ten, the people can't be traced down because they use disposable phones.

He says, people just need to be cautious.

"Do not give out any money. Don't give out any personal information. Hang up and call your local agency," said Palmer.

"The caller reportedly offered the resident an interest-free credit card as a qualified applicant."

The city doesn't offer credit cards and city staffers do not ask for, or collect, bank information over the phone.

Officials advise that anyone contacted with such an offer should verify a caller's identity, or request a callback number.

A recent jail sentencing in a phone scam operation may have put a dent in what has become a rival to the drug trade as one of Jamaica's most lucrative criminal enterprises.

Last week, U.S. prosecutors reached a major milestone when Lavrick Willocks, an alleged kingpin in the scam, was sentenced to six years in federal prison and ordered to pay $1.5 million US in restitution.

According to a local Jamaican news outlet, Willocks faced up to 40 years in prison but prosecutors agreed to a lighter sentence because he co-operated with authorities.

The scammers generally target people, particularly seniors, by telling them they've won a lottery prize in the millions of dollars. All they need to do is pay a processing fee to claim their prize.

The FBI believes there are hundreds of victims, including Canadians.
• CBC News: 'You don't want to tell anybody': Winnipeg senior describes scam ordeal

Agnes Frechette of Winnipeg was one such victim. She ended up losing her life savings, after sending them a total of $6,000 Cdn via Western Union.

"[The man on the phone] said that I was not listening to him and I never came back with the money fast enough for him. So he was going to punish me," she told CBC Winnipeg.

"You find yourself getting weaker every day, and you don't want to tell anybody because it's so, so embarrassing."

Jessica Gunson, an acting manager at the Canadian Anti-fraud Centre in North Bay, Ont., says she hears stories like Frechette's every day.

"I think a common trend with victims of fraud is that they are embarrassed or ashamed that they've fallen for the scam and they don't know who to turn to," she told The Current's guest host David Common.

She said the chances of victims getting their money back are "slim." More recently, fraudsters may request payments in bitcoin, making it more difficult for investigators to track the cryptocurrency payments.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O'Konek prosecuted Willocks, and worked closely with the FBI to uncover the case that spanned five U.S. states.

He said fraudsters find potential victims by using "lead lists" — databases usually used by legitimate telemarketers with information on potential or likely customers.

"Once you pay that initial part of what they think is a fee, they believe so strongly that they will continue to give more and more, because they have already essentially put so much money in," O'Konek told Common.

He added that the scams often target elderly people, who may be less tech-savvy. The scammers may also warn victims that their prize money will be lost if they tell anyone else about their supposed winnings.

Jovan Scott Lewis, a professor of African-American studies in geography at the University of California in Berkeley, has been studying the lottery scamming industry and community in Montego Bay, Jamaica — where he's originally from.

He told Common that when these types of phone scams grew to prominence around 2012, some of the scammers saw what they were doing as "a form of reparations for slavery, and for the many years of colonialism."

Some coveted the middle-class lifestyle they saw from North American or European tourists who flooded Jamaican beaches in the winter.

A moderately get-rich-quick scheme, like taking part in phone scam operations, offered them a measure of that lifestyle to themselves.

"As a middle income country, and especially in Montego Bay having the kind of regular tourist encounter, there is a kind of familiarity with Western wealth that makes a kind of ambition for that kind of lifestyle a very common experience," he said.

"And so there is a knowledge as to what lifestyle could be had. And because many of the call centres and the access to the victims, it made it quite possible."

OXFORD TOWNSHIP — Eastern Adams Regional Police are warning residents of a potential phone scam after an elderly resident of the Brethren Home in Oxford Township was recently victimized.

According to police, the crime was reported by the victim’s son, who said his mother was contacted by a man purporting to be a member of an unidentified police department on October 19.

The suspect told the victim her grandson was involved in an accident in New Jersey, had been arrested, and needed bail money. Another man, who identified himself as a public defender, contacted the victim a few minutes later, instructing her to go to Home Depot, put $2,000 on a gift card, and provide him with the card number to transfer the funds, which he said was bail money for the victim’s grandson.

The victim did as she was instructed. She was then contacted again later in the day by a man claiming he needed an additional $2,900. This time, the victim refused, police say.

Later in the day, the victim called her son, who contacted the victim’s grandson and confirmed that he had not been in New Jersey and was not involved in any car accident.

The victim provided two phone numbers to police. The first was an untraceable 877 number, police say. The second is believed to be a burner phone number from a Lynchburg, VA area code.

Eastern Adams Regional Police are advising all residents not to fall victim of this type of scam. Police Departments do not contact any individuals for bail money. Most importantly, if anyone asks for payment to be made by a gift card, Walmart Card, Home Depot card, etc., this is the telltale sign of a classic fraud, police say. No government agency ever accepts nor requires this type of payment.

ATLANTA - You may want to think twice before letting a stranger borrow your cell phone.

Atlanta Police have received reports from people saying they were scammed out of thousands of dollars after letting someone use their phone.

Since September, four people have contacted police with similar stories. They were approached by someone who asked to borrow their cell phone to make a call. Later, three of the victims received notifications from their bank alerting them of the transactions. In each case, money was sent from their cell phones to another party using the cash sharing app Venmo.

On September 18, a 28-year old woman left Woody's CheeseSteaks located on Monroe Drive. She told police she was approached by a man who asked to use her cell phone to contact a friend and tell them where he was located.

Later that day, she received a fraud alert from her bank for two transactions; one for $1,000 and another for $500. She told police the suspect was a young light skin African-American male who had short locs with blonde tips. He was wearing a green bomber jacket with letters, no shirt underneath and shorts. He was last seen in a red car with Mississippi plates.

On October 4, a 26-year old man was walking home from Inman Perk Coffee Shop when a man approached him saying he had an emergency and asked to borrow his phone because his was dead.

The man told police the thief made a call then sent a text because he said the person didn't answer. He received an email from his bank saying he had insufficient funds from three transactions of $1,000, $500, and $1,000. No description of a suspect was giving in the report.

Another 28-year-old woman said she was at the corner of 8th and Cypress Streets on October 11 when a well-dressed African-American teenager riding a scooter approached her. He asked to borrow her phone to call his friend because he was lost. After pretending to call and text someone, she said he asked her for directions to the nearest MARTA station. The next morning, she got an overdraft protection alert for a $1,000 and another for $1,500.

And on October 25, a woman said she let a black male use her phone while she was on the Beltline near Ralph McGill Blvd. She later realized he sent $1,500 to someone using the Venmo app.

Atlanta Police have not made an arrest in these cases and gives the following tips for people to help protect themselves:
• Keep any personal and financial information secure on your phone.
• Avoid using an auto login feature on any that app that contains sensitive information.
• Ensure that a password is required for each use and that apps are closed when not in use.

After nearly a year of dormancy, a scam in which trainers are targeted by someone claiming to represent a wealthy foreign businessman who wants to get into the game by handing over high-level horses is making the rounds again.

In reality, the fraudsters are using the ruse of a too-good-to-be-true business deal to gain access to a trainer’s phone or computer, presumably to steal financial data, bank account numbers, and passwords.

The way the thieves try to pull off the swindle is by having a person pretending to be an intermediary first call to outline the proposition, with the caveat that the allegedly super-rich mogul will only conduct subsequent business over ultra-secure communication lines.

The trainer is then steered to a fake technology pro who allegedly works for the businessman. Using a remote internet connection, that person will want to inspect the trainer’s digital device for what is described as a safety check. If given permission to access the trainer’s phone or computer, the scammers will then try to harvest personal data from it while claiming that the machine is full of security breaches.

If the ploy gets this far, the con artists will try to get debit card information from the trainer, claiming that a fee is required for custom software that needs to be installed to make the device secure before the rich investor will communicate with them.

What makes the scam so nefariously ingenious is that the hustlers are using the names of actual high net-worth individuals, encouraging potential victims to Google the person as a means of due diligence. Everything appears to check out online, but trainers have no way of knowing that the real wealthy person has nothing to do with the con artists.

“It was pretty elaborate,” one prominent, longtime Southern California trainer told TDN Friday. “They totally had me there for awhile.”

The trainer requested anonymity because the scam went far enough that his computer was compromised, and he doesn’t want to encounter further woes if the con artists decide to retaliate against him for speaking publicly about what happened.

The trainer said his ordeal began when he was recently cold-called by an individual claiming to represent one of the wealthiest men in China. The alleged intermediary explained the businessman’s “vision for racing,” claiming that he had recently purchased 30 Thoroughbreds and wanted to give 10 to the trainer to race in Southern California.

This method of operation deviates only slightly from similar scams reported in 2016 and again this past January by the Paulick Report. In those versions, the location of the supposed magnate was in the Middle East or India.

The intermediary encouraged the trainer to look up the potential client on Google, where everything the scammer claimed–like the wealthy man sponsoring races in Australia and being the part-owner of a soccer club in Europe–checked out.

“To make a long story short, he said he needed a really secure line of communication, and he would need his internet guy to contact me to make sure my computer was secure,” the trainer said. “Apparently, he was so wealthy that he couldn’t risk someone listening in to his horse plans.”

The trainer soon got a call that came up on his phone as an Australian number, which he now believes was spoofed.

“For all I know, it could have been from West L.A.,” the trainer quipped.

“I gave him access to my computer, and sure enough, the tech guy said all these viruses showed up,” he said.

But the technologist could clean up the trainer’s computer and make it secure–by installing software that cost $1,200 for a five-year subscription.

Considering the boost in horseflesh he’d soon be getting, the trainer chalked up the pricey patch as a cost of doing business.

But the trainer couldn’t immediately follow through on the payment because, as luck would have it, “I’m one of the few people on the planet who doesn’t have a debit card.”

The bogus tech worker proposed other means of payment, which bought the trainer some time to think over what was happening.

“I had some really bad thoughts about this, so I went down to the bank and closed out all of my accounts. I took cashier’s checks, and opened new accounts,” he said.

Yet still–and this underscores the allure of the confidence hustle–the trainer wondered whether he was over-reacting, and that his own paranoia might scuttle a lucrative deal.

“On the other hand, I was still very intrigued at the prospect of getting horses of high quality from a wealthy individual,” he said.

The trainer then got back in touch with the tech guy, who grew angry when the conditioner balked at payment.

“And that set off another red light,” the trainer said.

The trainer then called the intermediary and asked for the names of some of the horses the potential client wanted to hand over. Beyond saying one of them was sired by Frankel, the intermediary couldn’t provide those basic details.

“He got really incensed and said ‘I don’t like your allegations.’ Then his accent changed from Chinese to something else,” the trainer said–another tipoff that something was amiss.

The conditioner ended the communication there. He lost no money, but plenty of peace of mind and time.

“I had to buy all new computers and open new bank accounts, just to be safe,” the trainer said.

He also said he shared what happened to him with another prominent California-based trainer, who told him, “Oh yeah, they got me too, for $500.”

The Cedar Rapids Police Department is alerting residents of a scam they received reports of this morning.

Police say the scam involves phone calls to residents where the person on the phone claims $2,000 has been removed from the recipient's bank account.

The scammer then tells the resident they need to call a number to have the money returned.

Police say residents shouldn't call the number back. They also want to remind people not to give out personal or financial information.

Residents who are called by the scammer should contact their credit card company or financial institution directly to verify the account hasn't been compromised.

2018 has been the year of scams, to say the least. From fake CRA calls and emails to cloning credit cards, Canadians have had to be more vigilant than ever when it comes to protecting their funds. Unfortunately, the latest scam is the sneakiest, as it comes as a result of people attempting to call their own bank's service numbers, and not realizing it isn't their bank who is answering the phone.

READ ALSO: There's A Reason Why You Keep Getting Ads For Things You’ve Talked About But Haven't Actually Searched Up Online

The news of this scam came after an Edmonton couple fell victim to it. The victim, named Sharon, decided to call her bank's customer service in order to know what the balance on her account was. She dialed the number listed on the back of her card and when a person answered, they claimed she had won a cruise as a result of being such a loyal customer.

Her husband Yves had the account since he was 18 years old, so Sharon believed it was legit, telling Global News "they made it sounds so good." The offer was that everything on the cruise was paid for except for the flights to Florida and a $130 deposit on the room and food.

After Sharon accepted the offer and gave her credit card information over the phone, assuming she was talking to a bank employee, the next thing the "customer service representative" said made her husband realize she had made a terrible mistake.

It was after she gave her bank information that the "customer service representative" said they could "sweeten the deal," offering another two weeks onto the cruise if they paid an extra $1200. It was then that Yves realized his wife was being scammed saying "when they said $1200 bucks I said, 'No, no, no, I shook my head. I told my wife, 'Hang up, it's a scam.'"

Sure enough, by the time the couple was able to check online what their bank balance was, $175 had gone missing within the time she had hung up the phone and gotten to her computer. Thankfully, the pair was able to get to a bank location in enough time to freeze the account before more money was taken out. There they learned from bank employees that the scam was becoming a common occurrence for customers.

If you are still trying to figure out how a scammer picked up the phone instead of the bank's customer service if Sharon called the number on the back of her card, it's because she had made a typo in the number when dialling.

Scammers are purposely buying up phone numbers that are similar to popular bank customer service numbers in hopes people will make a mistake and think they are on the phone with their bank.

The scam is known as the "Fat Finger Phone Scam" and is definitely a dangerous one, considering most people don't think twice about dialling their bank and immediately assuming the person on the other end is a customer service representative. Especially considering that those conversations usually involve giving your personal and banking information, it's the perfect opportunity for scammers to get your information.

Meaning the next time you have to call customer service, you are definitely going to want to double check the number before you give out any of your personal information. Or if you are really worried, just go to a bank location in person for assistance!

A look into the identity of serial con artist Dene Broadbent

The salacious details of unsolicited late night phone calls in which a former radio jock turned con-artist allegedly told his one-time personal trainer he “wants (his) d***”, have been revealed in court.

Some might know Dene Broadbelt, 25, as real estate tycoon Harrison Eyles. To others he’s Infinity Music Festival director Dene Mussillon, anti-bullying advocate Harrison O’Connor, music promoter Nic Lloyd or Clay O’Connor. But to NSW Police and local courts, he’s now Luke Hemmings.

Mr Broadbelt has used several aliases and impersonated various characters for a string of failed business ventures and unpaid debts across Australia but has never been charged or convicted in relation to the matters.

News.com.au can exclusively reveal that the founder of the now defunct internet station Ridge Radio — who was once accused of faking his own death — last week pleaded guilty to the charge of using a carriage service to menace, harass and offend before it was dismissed on mental health grounds at Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court.

In a statement of police facts viewed by news.com.au, Mr Hemmings was alleged to have harassed Dale Berry, the owner of Peak Fitness gym in Woollamia on the NSW South Coast, in a series of unsolicited phone calls in July this year.

Mr Berry told police he was in bed asleep next to his wife and two-year-old daughter when Mr Hemmings made several calls to his mobile phone from 1.41am on July 12.

“I want your d***. How big is it?” Mr Hemmings allegedly said during one of the calls around 1.44am before the victim hung up on him.

Court documents allege that Mr Hemmings made further calls to Mr Berry two days later, around 9.40pm.

The victim replied: “Good one, mate. You f***ing idiot. Now that you’ve made contact, I’ve seen the police and they can trace your number.”

Mr Berry’s wife Shelby recorded the last phone call, according to the police statement of facts. Both the victim and witness have been “unsettled by the phone calls”.

Mr Hemmings had attended a personal fitness session with Mr Berry about two years earlier but they didn’t know each other on a personal level, the statement read.

Mr Hemmings, who lives with his mother in Surf Beach, NSW, was last week discharged by the magistrate on the condition he sees an allocated mental health care professional for two years and “takes all medications, strictly as prescribed”.

In 2015, Mr Hemmings admitted to “ripping off creditors in hundreds of thousands of unpaid fees and failed ventures”.

His past dealings have included promoting and selling tickets to bogus music festivals; hiring camera equipment, hotel rooms, limousines and services of small businesses on false work accounts; and luring teens out of school and work with the promise of a dream career before leaving them high and dry.

He has operated under various company names including Sly Creators, One 11 Agency, Aquaholic Photography, Colemans Studios, and VA Entertainment Australia and set up websites with fake staff profiles. He’s tricked high school students, ambitious university graduates, a police officer, small business owners, aspiring musicians and professionals out of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

He promised to pay them back as long as they allowed him to film their reactions during the handover. Some humoured him and said they’d welcomed the exchange if it meant they’d get their money back. He has not yet delivered.

Dream Media Darwin owner Chris O’Brien said Mr Hemmings still owed him about $20,000 after failing to pay for camera equipment hire in 2014.

“We sent him to Alice Springs for a job he said he was doing for Channel 9 (but it turned out to be a scam),” he said. Mr Hemmings had purported to be part of a film crew covering a story for the network about a charity cancer walk in the Outback.

Mr Hemmings went on to promote The Infinity Music Festival — in Darwin and several NSW and Queensland country towns — as a major electro-music event to be headlined by big name performers. It turned out be a sham and never went ahead.

Publicist Jarrod Meakins said he was hired by Mr Hemmings to promote the festival but quit when he wasn’t paid for his work.

“Some of the artists being advertised didn’t even know they were booked to play, because they weren’t. The last thing I did was help announce Darwin, and after that I pulled out when I found out what he was up to,” he said.

“In hindsight … It was never going to go ahead.” He was right.

Among the youngest of Mr Hemmings’ victims was a teen who claimed he was tricked into dropping out of school with the promise of a dream career. He reportedly promised to pay him $25 per hour as an assistant for Aquaholic Photography before loading him up with professional camera equipment then luring him to the other side of the country and leaving him to find his own way home.

VA Digital Hire later alleged Mr Hemmings obtained the equipment using business accounts that were not settled, leaving unpaid bills estimated at $20,000.

Ulladulla Web Design owner Scott Richardson previously told news.com.au he was contracted by Mr Hemmings to create posters and online flyers for the Infinity Music Festival. He said Mr Hemmings never paid him the $2000 for his work.

Eagle Embroidery business owner Roy Day, based in Bega NSW, said Mr Hemmings made two separate orders to embroider “photographer” and “crew” on to work uniforms and post them to a Batemans Bay address in 2013. Mr Day did the work but was never paid the $2000 for his services.

Mr Hemmings was also at the centre of a dispute between unpaid performers at the Eagle FM Mini Day Event and Goulburn Radio, NSW, that same year.

As pressure mounted on Mr Hemmings to pay back the money he owed, a press release was sent to national media informing them of his death, in 2015.

“I have to inform everyone of the sad news that Dene Broadbelt, died unexpectedly on Saturday night when he took his own life,” the email read. “There is to be a memorial service held ASAP (date and time will be announced as soon as possible). We would ask that Dene’s final wishes are observed, and there are to be no flowers, donations to World Vision would be welcomed instead.”

Mr Hemmings — who then called himself Dene Broadbelt — wasn’t dead. He denied he was behind the email.

Mr Hemmings later issued a press release where he claimed to be a changed man who had become an anti-bullying advocate. He said he had been approved by the NSW Department of Education to spread awareness about mental health in public schools.

A spokesman for the NSW Department of Education told news.com.au the claims it had approved Mr Hemmings were false and that it was the role of individual principals to approve or manage guest speakers in schools.

Mr Hemmings has previously claimed he was an official ambassador for Beyond Blue and Lifeline. Both organisations said the claims were untrue.

In another press release Mr Hemmings claimed he was writing an autobiography titled Too Good To Be True for a 2016 release. The title said it all, with a book about Mr Hemming’s life yet to hit the shelves.

Instead, he turned his sights to a young entertainer from a reality TV show.

Singer-songwriter Ben Denman was reeling when he discovered his talent manager of six months, who he knew as Luke Hemmings, was actually Mr Broadbelt.

Mr Denman, whose stage name is Ben Oddie, said he was first contacted by Mr Hemmings after he appeared as a contestant on X Factor Australia earlier that year.

Mr Hemmings introduced himself over social media as a businessman from ‘Sly Creators’. He told Mr Denman he was impressed by his talent and could help make him a star.

Mr Hemmings claimed he worked with Blink 182 and 5 Seconds of Summer — whose lead singer is also named Luke Hemmings. He said he knew international producers in Los Angeles who had worked with Afrojack, Iggy Azalea, Leona Lewis and Kelly Rowland, who had heard Mr Denman’s music and wanted to work with him. He sent Mr Denman stock pictures of a luxury office he claimed was in the same building as Sony in Los Angeles.

He told Mr Denman he had leased the property as his LA headquarters and had lined up work and meetings for them to make the overseas move in 2017.

It was all a sham. In reality, Mr Hemmings was unemployed and, according to him, bankrupt. But it would take six months of being managed by Mr Hemmings until Mr Denman became privy to it.

“I couldn’t believe it but lots of the other contestants on the show were getting signed by independent labels so I just thought that’s what was happening to me as well,” Mr Denman told news.com.au at the time.

“I made a video for Facebook to announce my dreams were coming true and I was moving to LA and everything.”

It all unravelled when Mr Denman became suspicious of Mr Hemmings and questioned him about his real identity. He said Mr Hemmings immediately stopped responding to his emails.

Mr Hemmings’ website soon disappeared and his business phone number was disconnected.

That same year, Mr Hemmings, operating under the alias of Harrison Eyles, the managing director of a business called Coast and Country Real Estate, attempted to lease a shopfront, order cars, and even held face-to-face interviews with people who replied to his job adverts.

Burswood Car Rentals owner Morrison Todd said Mr Hemmings owes him about $4000 for damaging a hired vehicle and unpaid bills.

“We had a credit card (when Mr Hemmings made the booking) but it stopped working after about one week,” he said.

Skip Film Productions NSW owner Noel Sadler — who is one of the con-artist’s victims — said Mr Hemmings “never follows through on anything he promises”.

“He doesn’t see the consequences of his actions … it’s all about him and the right now,” he said.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

While several people have reported their cases to police there is no active investigation into Mr Hemming’s dealings, according to NT Police. NSW Police didn’t respond to questions

NSW Police previously told news.com.au its “fraud squad (is) unaware of any incidents that are currently under investigation with this man”. Those who reported the incidents to police said they were told it was a civil case and they would have to go to court to get their money back.

The NSW Fair Trading complaints register only provides information about businesses that are the subject of 10 or more complaints in one calendar month.

“NSW Fair Trading has no current actions or prosecutions against Broadbelt,” a spokesman for NSW Fair Trading previously told news.com.au.

“Fair Trading’s advice to consumers who are dissatisfied in their dealings with this trader is to contact the trader and try to resolve the matter in the first instance.

“Customers who are unable to resolve their issues with the trader are advised to lodge a written complaint with NSW Fair Trading at www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au.

“Fair Trading will assess the complaint to determine next steps.”

NSW Fair Trading is “unable to intervene” if the dispute is between two businesses.

“Businesses seeking to recover debts may seek their own independent legal advice,” the spokesman said.

“In the event a debt is owed for services provided to a business, the creditor is advised to contact the NSW Small Business Commissioner on 1300 795 534 or 02 8222 4800, or online.”

FARMINGTON — State and local officials are advising citizens to be vigilant as certain phone scams are seeing a recent increase in local activity.

There are three types of phone scams resurfacing that Farmington citizens have reported to the Farmington Police Department recently, according to spokesperson Georgette Allen.

"We're trying to encourage people who have loved ones or friends who are not on the Internet to make sure the information is getting to them," Allen said.

The three scams deal with law enforcement, the Farmington Electric Utility System and cell phone service providers.

Scammers have been spoofing or imitating the phone numbers of the Farmington Police Department, and calling people to warn them they have a warrant for their arrest. The targets of the scam are instructed to pay the caller or they will be arrested, Allen said.

Allen added some of the scammers have been using Farmington police Chief Steve Hebbe's name in the calls.

Some Farmington detectives have received phone scam calls that spoofed their own work phone numbers.

"The chief is never going to call you and say, 'You got a warrant, and I'm coming to arrest you,'" Allen said.

Scammers often request that payments be made by having the victim purchase a prepaid debit, credit or gift card, then call the scammer back and share the information on the card with them, according to Allen. She said sometimes scammers will even request that the victim stay on the line with them while they purchase a card from a third party.

Any request that involves payment using that method should be a big red flag to potential victims, according to Jennie Lusk, director of the consumer and family advocacy services division for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. Lusk said nobody running a reputable business would request payment that way.

The Farmington Electric Utility System has been dealing with a similar issue. Scammers have been spoofing the city of Farmington phone numbers, warning account holders they are behind on payments and demanding money to avoid termination of service, Allen said.

The Farmington Electric Utility System mails disconnection notices to users, and citizens can call 505-599-1353 to check the status of their account, according to a Farmington Police Department press release.

Lusk reminded citizens that they are in control as the scammers try to get people to respond out of impulse or the scammer's politeness.

"A lot of times, the scammer (acts like the) consumer's best friend," Lusk said.

Both Allen and Lusk warned citizens to avoid sharing any personal information with someone who could be a scammer. They also suggested that citizens verify any claim by hanging up the phone and calling the organization or company that the caller claimed to represent.

Lusk said even the AG's Office has received calls from scammers calling residents, warning them their Social Security number has been deactivated and seeking personal information to reactivate the number.

Farmington police also have received reports of a scam in which the caller claims to be a representative of the recipient's cell phone service, stating their service will be suspended unless they confirm their personal information, Allen said.

Farmington residents can report the scams to the police by calling nonemergency dispatch at 505-334-6622.

Scams can be reported to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office at www.nmag.gov or to the Federal Trade Commission by visiting www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov or calling 1-877-382-4357.

ROCKVILLE, MD — Montgomery County police are warning residents about a phone scam in which callers pretend to be Pepco employees and ask for money.

In one incident on Oct. 30, a scammer — who claimed to work for the utility company — told a resident he was behind on his utility bill, officials said. The scammer told the resident he could pay the bill over the phone by getting a prepaid debit card and relaying the debit card's information over the phone.

If you think you've been a victim of this scam and have made a payment, you can call the police's non-emergency number at 301-279-8000.

Pepco has provided information regarding Pepco-related scams. Click here to learn more.

The scam has been targeting utility customers across the United States for more than five years, the utility said. The scammers, who target both residential and business customers, tell victims to purchase a pre-paid debit card, such as a Green Dot MoneyPak, for a specific amount from local pharmacies, retail chains or convenience stores. Once the utility customer gives the caller the card information, money on the card is removed.

Scammers will sometimes replicate utility phone numbers through caller ID, with some even copying the messaging and prompts given to customers through their interactive voice response system.
• If a customer receives a call from someone stating they are calling to collect a bill payment for Pepco, the caller should be able to provide specific information including:
• If the caller cannot provide this information, it is likely the call is not coming from Pepco. In this case, don't share any information, and call Pepco immediately at 1-202-833-7500 to report the scam.
• Customers should never give their social security number or banking or credit card information by phone unless they have initiated the call.

It's that time again, time to talk about the IRS scam call. You may have heard about it but not everyone has, and I know this because 2WTK gets calls every week about it! One couple reached out to our TEGNA Verify team after they received two phone calls in a day and the couple really feared they owed back taxes and were going to jail.

THE IRS DOES NOT:

Call you at home out of the blue.

Threaten immediate jail time or arrest without payment.

Take payment in any kind of gift card.

Verify any correspondence by you calling the IRS number on the website.

You can let the IRS know you got the scam call or the NC Attorney General's office. But what you really need to do, is just delete the message, don't pick up the phone if you don't recognize the number or don't engage when you get the call.

Staff in mobile phone shops have become key to the execution of "Sim swap" scams, Watchdog Live has discovered.

Undercover filming revealed that O2 and Vodafone employees are bypassing basic ID checks and handing over replacement Sim cards to potential criminals.

Once fraudsters gain control of a mobile number, they can intercept SMS text messages from banks containing security codes.

Scammers have drained thousands of pounds from victims' bank accounts.

O2 told the BBC it currently only asks for photo ID when replacing Sims on a monthly contract, and that customers on Pay As You Go contracts would always receive an authorisation code alerting them that someone is trying to access their number.

However, that did not happen with any of the numbers being used by the Watchdog Live team, who were able to walk out with a replacement Sim in almost every case.

O2 says it did send out authorisation codes, but they were not received by the victims' smartphones.

Vodafone said that it takes Sim swap fraud "extremely seriously" and that it is disappointed that two of its employees did not follow established security check procedures, despite being given mandatory training, reinforced by regular reminders to the contrary.

Previously, in some countries, Sim swap scams were used by scammers to ring and text premium numbers to run up large mobile phone bills.

But now that more online services use two-factor authentication, which requires text messages to be sent to mobile phones, there is more at risk.

Olga from Buckinghamshire had £2,000 taken from her bank account, after a fraudster managed to successfully request a replacement Sim for her mobile number without her knowing anything about it.

"It was like a state of shock and my first thought was that there must be some sort of error," Olga told Watchdog. "I was just sobbing down the phone saying all my money's been stolen."

Initially, Olga's bank refused to refund her the money, blaming her for not keeping her details safe.

But it eventually became clear that the fraudster had found a way in to her account after being given a replacement Sim card by EE.

Watchdog's undercover visits found that staff in EE and Three stores always stuck to their security policies by demanding photo ID.

Sim swap scams occur when a criminal is able to convince a mobile operator to issue them with a replacement Sim card, by claiming a false identity and pretending that their mobile phone has been either lost or stolen.

Criminals are able to do this using people's personal details that have been stolen using malware or cyber-attacks. Many of these details are then sold on the dark web.

The victim's Sim card stops working and the criminal can then access any online service that requires security codes to be sent to a user's mobile phone.

Security researchers have long believed that UK crime gangs are behind these scams, as the fraudsters manage to trick banks by logging onto mobile banking systems from locations close to the victim's home address.

In the past, this scam has been perpetrated by fraudsters calling the customer service call centres of mobile operators, as well as by hackers using fake mobile base station equipment bought from the black market.

While the scam has been in existence for at least four years - BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme demonstrated that they could attack bank accounts in 2016 - the number of cases of Sim swap fraud have rocketed by 60% since 2016.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley issued a scam alert on Oct. 18, warning Missouri residents about a new telephone scam. His office has received numerous complaints from Missouri residents after being contacted by would-be scammers claiming to represent the Social Security Administration.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley issued a scam alert on Oct. 18, warning Missouri residents about a new telephone scam. His office has received numerous complaints from Missouri residents after being contacted by would-be scammers claiming to represent the Social Security Administration.

People reported receiving a phone call from someone telling them that their Social Security benefits had been suspended, and they must call back in order to fix the problem. When consumers returned the call they are asked to provide personal information that the scammer can then use to commit identity theft or other fraud. Examples of the types of information these scammers might request include: Social Security number, date of birth and address.

The attorney general warned citizens not to provide personal information over the telephone unless absolutely certain about who is on the other end of the line. When the Social Security Administration calls individuals, the agency has typically contacted the person previously via mail. Anyone who receives a call from someone claiming to be from the Social Security Administration should hang up and contact the agency using their real telephone number, 800-772-1213.

If anyone receives a suspicious call from someone claiming to be from the SSA, they should report that information to the Office of Inspector General at 800-269-0271 or online at https://oig.ssa.gov/report. For information a phone call or any other type of communication claiming to be from the SSA, contact any SSA office or call SSA’s toll-free customer service number at 800-772-1213 to make sure it is legitimate, or contact the Missouri Attorney General’s Office at 866-289-9633. If someone becomes a victim of this scam, this should be reported to any FBI field office or the Missouri Attorney General’s Office at 800-392-8222.

The Cathedral City Police Department is warning residents to be mindful of "virtual kidnapping scams" aka cyber-kidnapping scams or phone kidnapping scams.

In the scam, an unknown caller pretends to have kidnapped a relative or friend of the person who answered the phone and immediately demands payment of a ransom.

According to the CCPD, the Coachella Valley has seen an increase on virtual kidnapping and extortion scams.

The scam isn't new but it has grown more sophisticated in recent years. Scammers are able to use social media to gather information on people and what their activities. With that info scammers know when a person is going to be away from their home and possibly in a situation where they could be at risk.

In some incidents, scammers target a block of telephone numbers with specific area codes. They will keep calling people until they find someone they can shock into believing the scam.

CCPD notes that the scammer will have a forceful, well-scripted approach that can be very convincing. They will use a child’s name, knowing that it will quickly raise a parent’s fear level. The scammer was probably able to find the child's name on social media or the parent might have unwittingly told the scammer the child’s name.

Police say it's important to realize that the scammer relies on shock, speed, and fear. They know they have a small window of opportunity to extract a ransom before the victim realizes the scam or authorities become involved.



 To avoid becoming a victim, look for these possible indicators:
• The call does not originate from the “kidnapped” person’s phone.
• The caller goes to great lengths to keep you on the phone, so you can’t verify their claims.
• The ransom money must be paid by wire, PayPal, MoneyGram or a similar third-party service.
• The ransom amount quickly decreases if the parent or loved one resists.

 If you receive a phone call from someone demanding ransom for an alleged kidnap victim, consider the following:
• Hang up the phone. If you engage the caller, don’t call out your loved one’s name. Try to slow the interaction.
• Request to speak with your family member directly. Ask, “How do I know my loved one is OK?” Ask questions only the alleged kidnap victim would know such as the name of a pet. Avoid sharing information about yourself or your family.
• Attempt to contact the “kidnapped” victim via phone, text, or social media, and request they call back from their own cell phone.
• To buy time, repeat the caller’s requests and tell them you are writing down the demand or tell the caller you need time to get things moving.
• If you suspect an actual kidnapping is taking place, call the Cathedral City Police Department on 911 or immediately call your local law enforcement agency – before you provide any money.
• If the caller is using an international phone number, please contact the local FBI office in Palm Springs at (760) 320-0800 or fbi.gov.

The Sheriff’s Office says they received multiple calls from concerned citizens regarding a phone scam targeting the area.

The caller in this scam claims to be an employee of the Dubuque County Sheriff’s Office who is contacting the potential victim to inform them of an outstanding warrant. They are advising to purchase iTunes cards and gift certificates to satisfy the bond on the warrant.

The Dubuque County Sheriff’s Office reminds residents that they do not accept iTunes cards or gift certificates as forms of payment. They also do not notify individuals that a warrant has been issued for them, unless that arrangement has been verbally discussed previously with the offender.

The phone numbers used in this scam were 563-349-7849, 563-326-8625, and 563-235-9496. If you receive a call from any of these numbers, please disregard it. If you purchased and sent iTunes cards or gift certificates as a result of this scam, please contact your local authorities.

Outlook RCMP are warning the public about a new phone scam that has already been targeting residents of Outlook and the surrounding area.

Sgt. Mark Langager says a string of scams are taking place that are asking people to make payments over the phone using the App Store on one's smartphone, as well as iTunes gift cards in order to pay for things such as taxes, debt collection, hospital & utility bills, and even charitable donations. The scammers targeting Outlook and area usually pose as someone from the Canada Revenue Agency.

Police want to remind the public that the App Store and iTunes gift cards can only be used to purchase goods and services on the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, for an Apple Music subscription, or for iCloud storage.

If you're approached to use these cards for any sort of payment outside of these services, then you are most likely the target of a scam.

The reason why scammers ask for iTunes gift cards is that the codes are difficult to trace. Once they obtain the codes, they can resell them to get money.

If you aren't completely sure whether you're the target of this or any other scam, you're asked to immediately report it to the Outlook RCMP.

If you are the victim of this fraud, please report this to the RCMP or contact Apple Support.

If you’re in the habit of automatically returning calls you missed, now would be an excellent time to break the habit, at least when it comes to calls from international numbers. Mobile phone users in multiple countries are falling victim to the so-called “wangiri phone scam,” which involves calling mobile phones and then hanging up after a single ring.

That’s not even the only major phone scam going on right now, as some Americans (myself included) are receiving voicemail messages from someone claiming to be from Microsoft.

UAE and Ireland struck by the wangiri phone scam

“Wangiri” is Japanese for “one ring and drop,” which is how the wangiri phone scam got its name. Although the scam seems to have originated in Japan, fraudsters are now trying to reach out and touch victims in many other countries.

One of the latest countries to be hit by the scam is the United Arab Emirates. According to news outlets from the country, many users are reporting missed calls from Antarctica, Luxembourg and Nauru, a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean. Others are reporting that they received international calls from South Korea and even the U.S. Some Irish consumers are also receiving wangiri phone scam calls from numbers originating in Chad and Liberia.

Thus, experts are advising consumers not to return calls to international numbers they don’t recognize — no matter where they originate from. In the UAE, consumers are urged to file complaints with their mobile service providers.

The way the wangiri phone scam works is simple. Scammers often call a block of phone numbers in sequential order using technology to ring multiple numbers at the same time. After a ring or two, they hang up, leaving a missed call on the consumer’s phone.

Victims who return the missed call are often charged up to $50 per minute on their phone bills. Scammers route them back to a phone number which charges premium rates, and then they use technology which prevents victims from disconnecting their callback. An automated message forces the victims to remain on the line until it’s over after several minutes. Often the message includes a number of rings before the recorded voice, so it’s not immediately clear that the call has been picked up.

According to telecom authorities in the UAE, perpetrators of the wangiri phone scam make money by sharing the revenue earned from the calls with the telecom provider in the country the calls originate from.

Returning an international call that’s part of the wangiri phone scam also opens up the victim to a plethora of phishing messages and links to fake contests and lotteries via text messages. Phishing scams associated with the wangiri phone scam often involve claims that the scammer is calling from the victim’s mobile service provider or bank requesting banking information or passwords.

Beware the fake Microsoft voicemail and other phone scams

If you can’t get past the concern that you may have missed an important call, there are some things to keep in mind. If someone is legitimately calling you from overseas, they will leave a voicemail message.

However, leaving a message does not necessarily mean the call is legitimate. It may just mean that the call isn’t part of the Wangiri phone scam. Here in the U.S., I have received voicemails from people claiming to be with “your credit card company,” although they obviously didn’t even know which company I have a credit card with, if any. I even received a call from someone who left a voicemail claiming to be from Microsoft and that Windows was going to stop working if I didn’t call the phone number they left. Plenty of other people are reporting similar voicemail messages, including many who don’t even have Windows PCs.

I should clarify that Windows shouldn’t quit working unless your computer is infected or there is some sort of technical problem which occurs without warning. Office 365 may stop working if your subscription runs out and you don’t renew it, but it seems unlikely that Microsoft will call to tell you this. They do send emails about it, but we recommend going to the company’s website and logging in directly rather than clicking on any links in any email.

If you receive a call from a company with a questionable message such as this, you should never call back the number they leave on the voicemail. Instead, you can look up publicly-listed customer service numbers for the company on its website and call those numbers instead to find out if the voicemail was legitimate.

And remember: no company will ever call and demand personal information, banking details or passwords. Not falling victim to scams such as the wangiri phone scam or fake Microsoft voicemail is as simple as not returning suspicious calls.

OGDEN — If your phone is ringing morning, noon and night with maddening robocalls, you are far from alone.

In October, Americans received over 5.1 billion automated phone calls, according to the YouMail Robocall Index. Utahns received 37 million of those calls.

“I get calls all through the day,” said Cindy Sutherland-Young. “Anywhere from five to 15, 20 a day. I have even had some in the middle of the night.”

Sutherland-Young owns I Spy Vintage, an antique store in Ogden. She says she is beyond frustrated by those constant calls. As much as she would love to ignore calls from unknown numbers, for her, it’s not an option. Every call could be a customer.

“I may have a purchase on the phone or shipping,” she explained. “Or, just asking if I’m open. I want them to know ‘yes’ or ‘no’.”

Sutherland-Young said she has listed her number on the National Do Not Call Registry, but the calls keep coming. And opting out of more calls by following a robocall’s prompts has never worked for her.

“If I press the prompt to be taken off the call list, they call from another number,” she said. “It is the exact same recording. It’s the same voice, same exact wording on each call.”

Of the 5.1 billion robocalls placed last month, YouMail estimates 42 percent of them were scams. By next year, nearly half of all mobile calls will come from scammers, according to First Orion, a company that provides call-blocking services.

“We have to get our hands around this problem if we’re going to be able to use our phones the way they are intended to be used,” said Utah assistant attorney general David Sonnenreich.

Despite new federal rules and record-breaking fines the Federal Communications Commission has slapped on several robocallers recently, Sonnenreich says the illegal calls keep coming.

“Fraudsters are creative and find ways around,” he said. “It will take a concerted, long-term effort and we have to make it not viable for them economically.”

Neighbor spoofing is one way scammers use to get you to answer the phone. They alter area codes and prefixes on the caller ID to make calls appear to be from a local number. The scammers bank on us being more likely to answer calls we think are coming from a neighbor or our kids’ school.

Sonnenreich says even he has been tripped up by spoofed phone calls.

“You think it is some sort of important crisis and you have to deal with it,” he said. “But it’s somebody saying, ‘Don’t hang up, you have just won a fabulous vacation.’”

Going after a single robocaller operation, even a big one, is a very time-intensive effort for investigators.

“We don’t have the resources to track down everyone who calls you with an illegal call,” explained Sonnenreich.

Recognizing this growing problem, the Utah attorney general and 34 of his counterparts sent a letter to the FCC in October, calling on the agency to pull the plug on spoofed robocalls by allowing carriers to detect and block the calls before they reach our phones.

“Usually, when we get involved, it is after the fraud has occurred and the money is lost,” explained Sonnenreich. “We want to use technology to stop the robocall from occurring in the first place.”

“We are in an arms race”

A new call-blocking technology called STIR / SHAKEN is well underway and should roll out over the next year.

“There is a tremendous, massive commitment by industry to fight these guys,” said Kevin Rupy of USTelecom, a trade association representing the telecom industry.

Here’s how it works: the caller’s network attaches a digital token confirming the call is from its real phone number.

“As that call transits through, it gets passed through one network to the next and that token gets passed to each successive carrier,” explained Rupy.

If your network cannot verify that token, you don’t get the call.

“That is the standard being developed, and it will provide some type of image on your phone saying that call has been verified,” Rupy said. “Basically, it introduces trust into the caller ID framework.

While that should help cut down on spoofing, both Rupy and Sonnenreich caution there is no silver bullet for robocalls. The bad guys constantly adapt.

“We are in an arms race,” said Sonnenreich, “and that is what we will always be in.”

There are ways you can weed out robocalls now, without waiting for technology to catch up.

Many third-party apps like NomoRobo, TrueCaller and Hiya work by comparing incoming calls to a huge and constantly growing list of known scam numbers. If there’s a match, the call gets blocked.

For $2.99 a month, Verizon and Sprint offer caller ID services that alert you if a call is a likely scam. It is up to you to decide if you want to take the call or not. AT&T and T-Mobile offer similar services for free.

First, do not answer calls from unknown numbers. If you do answer the phone and the recording gives you a choice to opt out of future calls, hang up without pressing any buttons. It is a common way for scammers to identify potential targets.

Also, make sure to file a complaint with the FCC or Federal Trade Commission with the time and date of the call, as well as the number that showed up on your caller ID. You will not see immediate results, but those complaints help investigators go after the bad guys.

CHICAGO (CBS)–It’s a huge multimillion dollar scam and taxpayers are footing the bill. Maybe you’ve had a call offering you a leg or back brace — for free.

Only, it’s not free because, as CBS 2 Investigator Pam Zekman reports, we are all paying for it.

“I’d just done something horrible,” recalled Donald, who didn’t want to disclose his last name.

Donald had received a call from someone supposedly from Medicare wanting to make sure he had gotten his new Medicare card.

In response to questions Donald said, “I rattled off my Social Security number and then I realized, oops, I shouldn’t have done that.”

He says when they started asking more questions, he realized it was a scam.

Then he received follow-up calls, telling him braces had been ordered for him.

Calls like this one that says: “… you may qualify for a knee or back brace at little or no cost to you.”

“I said to them, ‘This is a Medicare scam and you guys are criminals, do not send me anything,’ and I got very angry with them,” Donald said.

Donald told CBS 2 that he did not need a brace.

In fact, Donald is in very good shape and jogs on a regular basis, and even though he refused shipment of the braces, Medicare still paid $3,236 in taxpayer dollars for five braces that Donald didn’t need and never received.

Once the caller has your Social Security or Medicare number they get a doctor to sign off on a prescription for a brace –sometimes after a telephone examination. The caller then sends the order for the brace to one of several fulfillment companies located around the county.

We talked to a couple of doctors who signed off on these type of prescriptions, they say they get paid about $30 for each phone consultation, but deny being part of any scam. The doctors told us they were under the impression the patients had requested the braces.

“Right now, currently the medical supplies phone scam are the biggest one in the state and across the country,” said Travis Trumitch, from Age Options, a senior citizen advocacy group that helps report Medicare fraud.

Donald reported his case to the Medicare fraud hotline at Age Options.

“[It’s] very sad to see these companies are trying to defraud these innocent people here, and it’s a crime so we need to be on top of it,” Trumitch said.

Patients aren’t the only victims here. It’s all of us. A 2012 Inspector General Report revealed that taxpayers overpaid $37 million for back braces alone.

It’s unknown how much money has been wasted in total on unwanted braces.

But, a 2016 report shows that Medicare paid out almost $2.5 billion for prosthetics and orthotics, including braces.

Mabel Fowler has been inundated with calls after she was tricked into giving out her Medicare number. Then the boxes started to arrive.

“I’m surprised,” said Fowler. “I feel like it’s Christmas getting a package and I open it and I see all this.”

Over the course of four weeks she received 10 braces, including back braces, arm braces and leg braces.

Fowler said she is concerned that Medicare is paying for the braces and told CBS 2 that she did not order them and does not use them.

Medicare has already paid $4,389 of taxpayer money for the braces.

But it gets worse. We found similar braces online for just $1,163, 73 percent cheaper than what Medicare paid.

Fowler says it is a wast of taxpayer money.

About half of that money — $2,200 — went to a supply company in New Jersey called Matawan HME incorporated. They refused repeated requests to explain Fowler’s order.

All this begs the question: Why didn’t Medicare suspect something was wrong before approving payment for all these braces for just one person in four weeks?

In Fowler’s case, many of the braces don’t even fit and she never received any instruction on how to use them.

“It’s too complicated and it’s definitely not something she could do on her own,” said Amber Arnette, Fowler’s caretaker.

Arnette says she can hardly believe how many braces Fowler has received.

“If she needs braces, her doctor would call and order them,” said Arnette. “And her doctor hasn’t said anything to me or to her.”

We asked another doctor, an orthopedics expert about Fowler’s case.

“For a patient to be prescribed multiple braces for multiple body parts, without an adequate physical examination or traumatic event, sounds basically ridiculous to me,” said Dr. Charles Bush-Joseph of Rush University Medical Center.

Dr. Bush-Joseph has never treated Fowler, but her story is all too familiar to him.

“Patients are getting braces that they don’t really need and a third-party provider is collecting on them and the taxpayers like myself are footing the bill for this,” Dr. Bush-Joseph said.

How does this effect everyone?

“Well down the road premiums could increase for Medicare,” Trumitch, of Age Options, said.

And fraud like this threatens the very future of the Medicare program.

Donald still can’t believe he got taken.

“I feel violated is what I feel. I have the same feeling I felt when I was robbed once,” he said.

Both Donald and Fowler have filed complaints with Medicare and the Inspector General’s office.

Spokeswomen for both agencies said they could not comment on whether something is or is not under investigation. But they are concerned about any fraud and lapses in their systems that do no catch it.

If this has happened to you, please contact CBS 2 Investigator Pam Zekman at pzekman@cbs.com.

— Don’t accept anything over the phone and send back any braces you didn’t request

— If you need a brace talk to your primary care doctor

— Enter your phone number on the Do Not Call Registry https://www.donotcall.gov

A Flintshire resident has received a telephone call claiming to be from her bank reports OWL Cymru.

“The Flintshire householder was informed her that her daughter, who they said was called Claire, had spent £ 1,500 whilst in Poland on holiday.

The resident informed the caller that her daughter was not called Claire.

The caller said the transaction was fraudulent and to claim it back she had to purchase iTunes vouchers to the value of £1,000.

The resident attended at a local store, who thankfully queried why she was purchasing the vouchers and identified it as a scam.

Remember, your bank would not contact you asking you to purchase iTunes vouchers in this way.

If you have a call from someone claiming to be from your bank tell the caller you will phone them back, but only phone them back using a telephone number obtained from a trusted source, not using one provided by the caller.”

MILWAUKEE -- It is a crime that comes in with the cold. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says this scam operates over the phone. While it happens throughout Milwaukee, the city's south side has been heavily targeted.

"Anybody that pays for heat is going to be affected by this scam. If you're a homeowner, a business owner, a renter in certain places," said Jim Temmer of the BBB.

Temmer said criminals claiming to be We Energies workers are targeting small businesses claiming their energy bill is long past due.

"They threaten to turn off your heat and you don't want that to happen," Temmer said.

The caller demands money or they will kill the power.

"Maybe there is a legitimate problem with We Energies, but they are not going to ask for payment on a prepaid debit card," Temmer said.

It is the exact call Antonio Ingrilli received at Caterina's at 92nd and Oklahoma in West Allis.

"They said I was behind on the bill and they were going to cut the electricity," Ingrilli said.

But the BBB says others in Milwaukee have fallen for the ploy.

"We found this scam is prevalent in the Hispanic-speaking communities." "We found this scam is prevalent in the Hispanic-speaking communities -- and they are using Spanish-speaking scammers," Temmer said.

Temmer said if you do get this call to contact the BBB and We Energies, but only after you hang up the phone. He also said if you are a small business owner, keep your guard up.

"They always pick the small places and not the chains," Ingrilli said.

According to the BBB, We Energies has received 600 reports of this particular phone scam.

Every single day, people are called with the latest scam.

But it’s not everyday you hear about a school being targeted.

The caller claimed to being a sports media marketing company offering the opportunity for advertising.

That is if you pay a few hundred dollars.

We decided to give them a call.

“You have reached sports media,” said the voicemail for (469)209-6940.

Multiple calls went unanswered and sent to voicemail.

“All of our sales reps are currently busy,” said the recorded voice on the phone. “If you would leaved a detailed message, we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you.”

But when this number called Sheyenne High School, the school’s staff made sure to do their research.

They popped the number into a quick search, and they found that this number is commonly associated with similar scams involving high schools and businesses across the country.

You can do the same thing with any suspicious phone number.

Putting the number in a search engine will pull up information to see if it has been associated with a scam.

Whitepages will also assess the number and tell the “spam or fraud potential” as well as show previous reports.

(469)209-6940 has been deemed a scam on this site.

So make sure you keep yourself protected and do your homework before trusting every call that comes your way.

KILGORE, Texas (KETK) - Kilgore police are warning about a phone scam in which the callers tell people they are past due in payments to AEP Southwestern Electric Power Co. and are about to have their meters pulled.

The callers, who are likely to be foreigners, demand the recipient buy Green Dot debit cards and provide the callers with the numbers, according to a police department Facebook post made Thursday.

According to our newspaper partner, Longview News Journal, SWEPCO has posted about the scam since 2014 to alert customers not to be deceived. The imposter might have a caller ID that says SWEPCO or play hold music similar to what SWEPCO uses. The department says SWEPCO does not call and threaten disconnection for past-due bills and will never ask for untraceable debit or gift cards to be bought to pay a customer’s account.

Recipients of the calls should contact local police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) and notify SWEPCO.

Another angle on a common scam is targeting Trumbull County residents according to the sheriff.

Chief Sheriff's Deputy Joe Dragovich tells 21 News they are investigating reports from a person who says they got a call from someone on a Trac phone claiming to be a “Lieutenant Walker” from the Trumbull County Sheriff's Department.

The alleged “Lt. Walker” tells the person that he or she missed a subpoena to appear before a grand jury and say they now need to pay $850 on a prepaid Visa or face arrest.

Dragovich says there is no Lieutenant Walker at his office and they would never call someone for something like this.

He wants to make sure the public is aware of the scam so they don't fall for it.

Anyone who receives such a phone call should report it to local authorities. Always check with the agency the caller is alleging to work for and never agree to meet the caller to remedy a legal issue with a prepaid credit card.

Dubai: A manager has been jailed for one year for cheating a woman of Dh21,000 after deceitfully convincing her that she had won Dh200,000 cash prize from du.

The Russian received an SMS followed by a phone call from someone who told her he was from du and that her number won a grand prize of Dh200,000 in September 2017.

The Russian, who fell for the trick, was told to pay Dh21,000 as tax in order to claim her prize.

She paid the ‘tax’ in phone credits and made instant cash transfer before realising she had become a victim of phone scam.

On Tuesday, the Dubai Court of First Instance convicted the 26-year-old Pakistani defendant of using someone else’s Emirates ID when he went to collect the transfer, swindling and embezzling the Russian’s money.

Court records said the accused abetted two suspects, who remain at large, in tricking the employee and embezzling her Dh21,000.

Presiding judge Mohammad Jamal said the accused, who pleaded not guilty, will be deported.

“I used the Emirates ID, but I did not swindle the claimant or embezzle her money,” he told the court.

The Russian said she fell for the caller once she was notified about her name and work address.

“The caller said I should pay them Dh21,000 in tax fees to be able to claim my Dh200,000 prize. He gave me a man’s name and said I should transfer the fees to that person. He said that the transfer should be in the form of phone credit. I sent them Dh12,500 and Dh2,000 in instant cash transfer and the remainder in phone credit. Later I discovered that I had been duped and reported the matter to the police,” she testified to prosecutors.

The accused told prosecutors that he met one of the two runaway suspects, who informed him that they had intended to trick victims and embezzle their money.

“He didn’t tell me how, but he just asked me to collect instant cash transfers in the name of someone called Gulam. The other suspect handed me the ID to present it at money exchange houses to collect the cash,” the suspect said.

Older adults lose more than $36 billion every year to financial scams, according to a 2015 study. Unfortunately, con artists see the elderly population as an easy and vulnerable target.

Mike Rothman, president of the American Securities Administrators Association, told CNBC that scammers take this approach because the current elderly population is one of the wealthiest we’ve seen with such hefty retirement savings. Where the money goes, the con artists follow.

With so many scams targeting older adults, it’s essential to make yourself and your loved ones aware of the different types of cons. Here is a list of common financial scams that specifically target the elderly and how you can prevent them:

The grandparent scam is common because it appeals to older adults’ emotions. Scammers get the phone number of a senior and they call pretending to be a grandchild. Making their lie seem more believable, the con artist will playfully ask the older adult to guess what grandchild is calling. Of course, the first reaction will most likely be for the senior to name a grandchild and then the scammer can easily play along, acting like they guessed right. Now the grandparent thinks they are talking to their grandchild.

Don’t miss: How I got duped by a phishing scam

The scam artist will then begin to confide in the grandparent, saying they are in a tough financial position and they need the grandparent’s help. Asking them to send money to a Western Union or MoneyGram, they plead for the grandparent not to tell anyone. If the grandparent complies and sends the money, the scammer will likely contact the senior again and ask for more money.
• Never send money to anyone unless you have 100% proof that it is who you think it is. Scammers can find out quite a bit of information from social media and other methods, so don’t think that just because they know a couple pieces of information about you and your family that it is legit.
• Verify that it is actually your grandchild on the phone by texting or calling the grandchild’s real phone number and verifying if it is him or her.
• Call the parent of the supposed grandchild and find out if the grandchild really is in trouble.
• Talk to your family members now and compile a list of questions only you and your family know the answers to. If a family emergency really does happen, you can ask the questions and know if it is your family member based on the answers.

The sweepstakes scam is when con artists contact the elderly either by phone or email and tell them they have won something, whether that be a sum of money or another type of prize. To claim the prize, scammers tell them they have to pay a fee. Once the senior agrees, scammers send a fake check in the mail. Before the check doesn’t clear and seniors can realize it is a scam, they have already paid the “fee.”
• Do not give out any financial information over the phone or email.
• Practice internet safety by protecting your passwords, shopping on encrypted websites, and avoiding phony emails.
• Be skeptical of any message that says you have randomly won a prize and you must do something before you can claim it. Unless you specifically enter a contest, you most likely aren’t going to randomly win a monetary prize.

Because of the Affordable Care Act that allows seniors over the age of 65 to qualify for Medicare, scam artists don’t have to do much research about seniors’ health-care providers. This makes it simple for scammers to call, email, or even visit seniors’ homes personally and claim to be a Medicare representative.

There are a variety of ways these con artists use this Medicare scam to target the elderly. One way is telling seniors they need a new Medicare card and to do so, they need to tell the “Medicare representative” what their Social Security number is. An additional way is they can tell seniors there is a fee they need to pay to continue their benefits.
• Do not give out any information to someone you have not verified is from Medicare. Real Medicare employees should have your information on file so if you are skeptical, ask the person some questions to verify it is legitimate.

A common scam to target seniors who live alone is the “woodchuck” scam. Scam artists will claim to be contractors and will complete house projects if seniors agree to let them.

The scammers will gain seniors’ trust and eventually come up with a variety of fake repairs that need to be done, such as a roof repair. This often results in seniors giving the fake contractors thousands of dollars.
• Make sure the person doing your home repairs is a professional. Find out what company they work for and call and verify they are indeed a legitimate contractor.

Con artists are using senior homeownership to their benefit. The mortgage scam is when scammers offer a property assessment to seniors, telling them they can determine the value of their home. This scam has become increasing popular as housing confidence is hitting record highs and people are putting a large chunk of their income toward saving for new homes.

Also see: Here’s how fraudsters can ‘steal’ your voice to rob your bank account

The scam artists make the process look legitimate by finding the home’s information on the internet and sending seniors an official letter detailing all of the found information. The scammers do this because it is an easy way to con seniors into paying a fee for the requested information.
• Ensure the property assessment is legitimate by asking what company they work for and following up with the real company to verify.

Talk to your loved ones

Older adults are often too embarrassed to tell authorities or a family member they have been scammed. Talk to the seniors in your life and let them know they can confide in you and let you know if they have been scammed. You can also have them read through this article and make themselves aware of the scams that could potentially target them in the future.

Check your credit regularly so you are aware of any suspicious activity on your accounts.

As part of the scam, a caller spoofs a Madison County Sheriff's phone number, 208-356-5426. That is the former main number for the office and will show up on caller ID as coming from the Sheriff's Office.

In one of two scams, the caller will then try to collect money for warrants over the phone or arrange for their victim to contact a law firm and collect a debt. The sheriff's office said such calls are always a scam, because law enforcement will never use those tactics to collect money over the phone.

If there is a real civil paper or warrant for you, a deputy will be sent to your home to serve you with the paperwork directly.

FRAUDSTERS are pretending to be police when phoning residents in York as part of a new scam.

North Yorkshire Police said a number of residents had received calls from people offering "crime awareness appointments in peoples homes to offer them advice".

However, a force spokeswoman said: "The number is not linked to North Yorkshire Police and is believed to be bogus, please don't let strangers into your home and report incidents to 101."

Detective Inspector Jon Hodgeon from the force's Major Fraud and Economic Crime Unit, said this was likely the latest attempt by fraudsters to target certain residents.

He said: "People aren’t always who they say they are. Fraudsters use a range of tactics to target people, especially the elderly and vulnerable. They may pretend to be from your bank, the police, a utility company, a government department or someone else you usually deal with and trust.

"Never just assume someone is who they say they are. Be confident and refuse unusual requests for personal or financial information. It’s okay to stop the discussion if you do not feel in control of it. If you need to call the police or your bank back to check, wait five minutes and call someone you trust first to make sure the phone line is free or use a different line all together – one of the many tricks fraudsters use is to stay on the line after you hang up to make you think that you are speaking to someone genuine."

Det Insp Hodgeon also advised speaking to a trusted relative, friend or neighbou behore acting or handing over money or details, and always to phone 101 or 999 if a crime is in action.

Incidents can also be reported to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk or on 0300 1232040.

Det Insp Hodgeon also offered six tips to the public to help them spot potential scams:

1. The police or your bank will never phone and ask you for your PIN or full banking password, even by tapping them into your phone keypad.

2. The police or your bank will never ask you to withdraw money to hand over to them for safe-keeping or to aid an investigation.

3. The police or your bank will never ask you to transfer money to a safe account for fraud or investigation reasons, even if they say it is in your name.

4. The police or your bank will never send someone to your home to collect cash, PIN, cards or cheque books if you are a victim of fraud.

5. The police or your bank will never ask you to purchase goods using your card and then hand them over for safe-keeping.

6. The police or your bank will never ask you to lie to your bank about why you are withdrawing or transferring money.

SAN ANGELO, TX – There is another phone scam going around, but this time it is targeting parents of high school students preparing for college. The scammers claim to be from The College Board which is the organization that is responsible for the PSAT and SAT tests.

They are calling or emailing people, asking for credit card numbers so they can send PSAT prep materials that the student has supposedly requested. The scammers usually have the student’s name, address and phone number which makes the scam seem more believable. Except for the face that your student didn't ask for materials, and it’s not this group that is calling.

Here are some tips to avoid a test prep scam: https://go.usa.gov/xPUZT
• None will never ask you to give credit card, bank account or password information over the phone or via email. will never ask you to give credit card, bank account or password information over the phone or via email.
• None Make sure the company offering test prep materials is legitimate. Before you give up your money or personal information, research the company online. Search for their name plus the word “scam” or “complaint.” See about other people’s experiences and talk to someone you trust, like another parent or your child’s school counselor, before you pay.
• None Consider how you pay. Credit cards have significant fraud protection built in meaning that, if you find out you paid a scammer, you may be able to get your money back if you report it quickly. If anyone asks you to pay by wiring money or by using a re-loadable card or gift card, it’s a scam.

If you have been targeted by a scam, whether you lost money or not, let us know at ftc.gov/complaint.

PALO ALTO, CA -- A phone scam in which a suspect pretends to be an immigration officer is going around, city police warns.

A man in his 60s reported to police that he received a call on his cell phone from a man who was seeking crucial information pertaining to his identity such as the man's passport, driver's license and social security number. The suspect told the man he was a "victim of identity theft." In another call, the man claimed to be Palo Alto police officer "Jim Hopper." A third call claiming to be from an immigration worker was a request for the victim to load money on gift cards to pay for new identification. In summary, the victim was scammed out of $10,000.

There is no officer Hopper. Detectives are conducting an investigation into the matter.

The Palo Alto Police Department will never solicit payment in any form for any reason over the phone. The money solicitation came from a Palo Alto police number that was spoofed. This means the suspect used commercial software to disguise the true number, the law enforcement agency emphasized.

Gift card scams over the phone are becoming more prevalent.

HONOLULU — As part of national Utility Scam Awareness Week, local utilities, police and consumer experts are joining forces to prevent customers from being scammed.

The Hawaiian Electric Companies, Hawaiian Telcom, Hawaii Gas, Honolulu Board of Water Supply and Kauai Island Utility Cooperative have partnered with the state Office of Consumer Protection and Honolulu Police Department to combat scammers who target utility customers.

Customers need to be alert and recognize scams, especially when criminals threaten to disconnect service unless a payment is made.

“Unfortunately, scammers are always looking for potential victims, and the utility scam is one of the common ruses,” said HPD Deputy Chief John McCarthy. “Whenever you receive a phone call or email or letter that sounds suspicious or out of the ordinary, always check with the organization or business before making any payment or giving out personal financial information. You don’t want criminals to get your hard-earned money.”

Scammers are targeting customers who rely on vital services such as electricity, water, gas and telecommunications. And utilities often see a spike in scams during the holidays.

The utilities offer the following tips:
• If the caller says your utility account is delinquent and threatens to shut off service immediately unless payment is made, it’s a scam.
• If someone calls purporting to be from a utility demanding immediate payment over the phone, via money transfer, prepaid debit cards or by Bitcoin, it’s a scam.
• If the caller asks to meet the customer in person to pick up a payment, it’s a scam.
• If you receive an email from your utility urging you to click on an embedded link or attachment to resolve a utility issue or pay a bill, think before you click. It’s likely a scam.
• If a utility worker shows up at your home or place of business, ensure that person is wearing official attire with a logo, driving a properly labeled vehicle and carrying company identification. When in doubt, call the utility’s customer service center.

A MURDER TRIAL has been adjourned at the Central Criminal Court after jurors were targeted in what’s thought to be a phone scam, where the caller claimed to be from the Courts Service.

The jurors were serving in the trial of a father-of-five, who shot his friend dead and dismembered his remains, which were later found in the Grand Canal.

The jurors had spent the first part of the day hearing the contents of Garda interviews carried out with Paul Well senior, who was denying involvement in Kenneth O’Brien’s murder.

The 50-year-old of Barnamore Park in Finglas has now admitted shooting dead his fellow Dubliner and dismembering his body. However, he has pleaded not guilty to murdering the 33-year-old at his home in Barnamore Park on 15 or 16 January, 2016.

He claims that the deceased had wanted him to murder Mr O’Brien’s partner, so that he could take their child back to Australia, where he had previously lived.

The jury heard evidence yesterday of what Mr Wells had said in half a dozen interviews, including telling Gardaí that they should go to Australia to find out why Mr O’Brien was murdered. He also said he ‘could not say’ why the deceased had transferred more than €50,000 into his account.

The 11 jurors were asked to go to their jury room while the parties arranged the next portion of interviews to be played on DVD. However, when they returned to court, they informed the judge of other developments.

The foreman said that both he and another juror had received missed calls from the same Dublin number in the space of half an hour. The other juror had also received a voicemail.

“It was distorted,” he said. “You could just make out Courts Service.”

Mr Justice Paul McDermott sent the jury away again, later calling all 11 back to say that a preliminary investigation had indicated that the call was part of a scam.

He called the officer, who had carried out the enquiries, Sergeant Gerard Moore.

“It appears to be a scam,” he testified, explaining that people would dial the number from which the missed call would come.

“They’re eliciting information as opposed to giving information,” he said of what would be heard on the other side.

Justice McDermott said that it appeared that it was nothing to do with the murder case and nothing to do with anything the jury had heard in court.

He said that, in order for this investigation to be fully concluded, he would ask for the phones to be made available to a Garda, who could listen to the voicemail.

“We can resume tomorrow when the investigation is completed,” he said, adjourning the murder trial until this morning.

Sgt Martin Long had testified earlier that he was involved in interviewing the accused following his arrest on suspicion of murder.

He said that Mr Wells said that nobody else had access to his bank account and denied that Mr O’Brien had owed him any money.

He explained that he was in receipt of Jobseeker’s Benefit of €320 a week and that the most he would have in his bank account would be a few hundred euro.

The Gardaí then asked if he could tell them about the €14,500 he had withdrawn from that account that January.

“No, I can’t,” he replied. “It’s not in my possession anyway.”

He was asked if it had anything to with the murder of Mr O’Brien.

“No,” he insisted. “I wasn’t involved in any of his activities.”

He agreed that the €52,925 that had been transferred into his account over the previous 18 months had belonged to Mr O’Brien.

“A man was murdered. A lot of his money goes into your account,” remarked the Gardaí, explaining that they needed to find out what happened.

“You’d better go to Australia then,” replied Mr Wells.

Senators from both side of the aisle have united to fight a foe so insidious that it’s a threat to both parties’ sanity: Robocalls.

South Dakota Senator John Thune (R) and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (D) introduce the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act Friday which would increase penalties on illegal scam calls, require carriers to adopt technology that would verify calls were legitimate before connecting them to consumers’ phones, and broaden the Federal Communications Commission’s power to fine at-fault telemarketers.

“I’ve heard from countless South Dakotans who are tired of the abusive robocalls and scams that are constantly interrupting their daily lives,” said Thune, who also serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, in a statement.

And robocallers don’t limit themselves to South Dakota area codes.

A recent report from First Orion, a company that provides caller ID and call blocking services, found that by early next year, nearly half of all calls you get will be from a mobile scammer. That’s right. A whopping 44.6% of calls Americans receive by early 2019 will be robocalls. (Versus 29.2% of calls in 2018 and 3.7% of calls in 2016.

Senators as well as FCC Chairman Ajit Pai took to Twitter to celebrate the introduction of the bill.

CHURCH HILL — Church Hill police are warning about a new scam in which a caller claims a family member of the victim has caused an accident and owes money for the damage, and won't be released and/or will be harmed unless money is paid.

The CHPD received a report on Friday in which a Church Hill family was coerced into buying $560 worth of Visa gift cards, and then giving the card numbers to the culprits.

There was a second complaint to the CHPD Tuesday pertaining to an almost identical scam, but this time the intended victims started asking questions, and deduced that it wasn't real.

Both scam phone calls were made from a phone with the number (814) 795-6628, which is a Pennsylvania area code.

CHPD Chief Chad Mosely told the Times-News Tuesday what differentiates these two incidents from most telephone scams is the amount of personal information the scammers knew about their victims.

They knew the names and cell phone numbers of the victims, the names and relationships of the victims’ family members, what kind of cars they drove, and apparently where they worked.

In one case the "accident" supposedly occurred in Sullivan County. In the other it happened in Washington County.

Both were in locations the victims would have expected their family member to be.

In the Friday report the victim received a call from a person claiming to be a Sullivan County paramedic who stated the victim's mother had been in a crash.

In the background the victim hears arguing, and then a person identifying himself as Michael Cruz supposedly snatched the phone form the paramedic and states that the victim's mother struck his son's motorcycle, causing $600 worth of damage.

Cruz states that police will not be called because his son is wanted, and some other men are holding his mother prisoner until the $600 is paid.

The victim was told not to hang up with Cruz or his mother wouldn't be released. After the ransom had been paid the victim hung up with Cruz, called his mother, and found out she was OK and the entire call was a bogus.

On Tuesday another victim contacted the CHPD to report an almost identical scam in which they received a call from someone claiming to be from Washington County EMS stating their son had been in a crash.

"They needed him (the victim) to meet and pay cash, or they would harm him," Mosley said. "This (intended victim) started asking questions, and then hung up on them when he realized it was (phony)."

Anyone with information that could lead police to these scammers is asked to contact the CHPD at (423) 357-3487 during business hours, and (423) 357-7181 after hours.

PINCKNEYVILLE -- Pinckneyville Community Hospital has been made aware of a phone scam in our area involving callers posing as representatives from the hospital. These calls have been both live people and automated messages. This is a case of Caller ID "spoofing," a high-tech manipulation of the Caller ID feature that allows the scammer to disguise their true identity by making the phone number appear to be that of the hospital.

Please help us educate your family, friends, neighbors and others about this.

If you have not been a patient at Pinckneyville Community Hospital and/or the Family Medical Center, or are not currently scheduled for an appointment or procedure, it is unlikely that you would be receiving a call from Pinckneyville Community Hospital.

If you are a patient of Pinckneyville Community Hospital and/or the Family Medical Center and you are unsure as to why you would receive a call from them, ask for the caller's name, hospital department and a direct phone number to call them back.

You may not be able to tell right away if an incoming call is spoofed. Be careful about responding to ANY request for personal identifying information.

Never give out personal information such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, mother's maiden names, passwords or other identifying information in response to unexpected calls or if you are at all suspicious.

If you get an inquiry from someone who says they represent a company or a government agency seeking personal information, hang up and call the phone number on your account statement, in the phone book or on the company's or government agency's website to verify the authenticity of the request.

Use caution if you are being pressured for information immediately.

If you have a voicemail account with your phone service, be sure to set a password for it. Some voicemail services are preset to allow access if you call in from your own phone number. A hacker could spoof your home phone number and gain access to your voice mail if you do not set a password.

If you receive a call and you suspect Caller ID information has been falsified, or you think the rules for protecting the privacy of your telephone number have been violated, you can file a complaint with the FCC. You have multiple options for filing a complaint with the FCC:

An 82-year-old woman from Corona was the victim of a scam after an unknown caller convinced her to fork over thousands to bail out her grandson from jail, according to police.

The caller said her grandson had been arrested, and needed $5,000 to post bail, police say.

A man then arrived at the home after the call, where the victim handed him over the money. The thief then fled toward Corona Avenue.

No injuries were reported in the case.

Police describe the suspect in the scam as Hispanic, in his 30s, heavy-set and balding, and last seen wearing dark eye glasses and dark clothing.

Officials from a Trumbull County fire department wants residents to know that while they do accept donations of baked goods from people, they don't take cash.

A post on the Farmington Township Fire Department's Facebook page says they have gotten calls from residents who say they are receiving phone calls asking for donations for the department.

The caller has been identifying himself as “Mike Davis”.

The post goes in to say if you get such a call, don't accept it as legitimate.

“We do not accept or summon donations via phone calls or any other means other than our department sponsored fundraisers,” according to the post. “We only accept baked goods from residents because that just makes sense.”

The post asks people to share the information with their neighbors.

The Boston University Police Department warned students Thursday afternoon about an international phone fraud scheme targeting Asian students on its Charles River campus.

The department sent an alert to students at about 4:50 p.m. notifying them of three incidents that have been reported since Oct. 12. “All three appear to involve similar themes and are clearly targeting our Asian student population,” the department said in a statement on their website.

“These appear to be part of a much larger scheme, which has been perpetrated over the last several months in cities such as New York, Boston, San Francisco, Houston, Los Angeles, as well as in Canada and Australia,” BU police said in the statement.

On Nov. 2, a BU student was convinced to transfer $49,000 in separate payments using an online payment platform relating to Bank of China, according to the statement.

The student received a pre-recorded phone call of a female voice speaking in a Chinese dialect and claiming to be from the DHL package delivery company, The student was then transferred to a man claiming to be a Shanghai police officer.

This person accused the student of dealing in fake credit cards and requested the money transfers.

The fake call followed two other calls targeting BU students in October.

A student on Oct. 12 received a call from DHL and was connected to a person who claimed to be a Chinese customs agent accusing the student of using fake credit cards.

The student sent $5,500 using the same payment platform.

On Oct. 24, another student received a similiar phone call and was convinced to share personal information, but did not transfer any money.

The suspect has also sent photos of a person in uniform in order to convince the student of their status, the department said.

He is most likely located overseas and could be operating with others.

He will also threaten students with the cancelation of their visas if they refuse to comply, and tells them they may not speak to anyone about the transaction.

The scheme is meant to capitalize on international students’ fear of not cooperating with the government, campus police said , and assured those students that they are not obligated to speak with them or transfer any money.

The department also provided tips from the Federal Trade Commission on avoiding fraud.

The incidents are under investigation by the Boston University Police Detective Unit.

Anyone with information should contact the BUPD at 617-353-2121, or report anonymously by texting “BU” to 847411.

WHATSAPP users are being warned about a hoax message making its way around the chat app.

The convincing scam leads you to believe that your phone will be completely wiped – without any hope of a fix.

But it's actually a complete hoax – or at least, it's partly a hoax.

The message reads: "If you know anyone using WhatsApp you might pass on this.

"An IT colleague has advised that a video comes out tomorrow from WhatsApp called martinelli do not open it.

"It hacks your phone and nothing will fix it. Spread the word."

The message continues: "If you receive a message to update the WhatsApp to WhatsApp Gold, do not click!!!!!

"Now said on the news this virus is difficult and severe. Pass it on to all."

Cybersecurity firm Sophos has described the message as "half rubbish", and calls the "martinelli" video a "fictional threat".

Spanish police the the Snopes fact-checking site have both confirmed that a sinister "martinelli" video doesn't exist – but has been part of a hoax chain message since mid-2017.

"Given that there apparently isn’t any 'martinelli' video, WhatsApp users are safe from it," Sophos wrote in a warning post.

"All they have to do is inform senders that they’ve been taken in by a chain letter, tell them to please stop forwarding it, and of course, refrain from forwarding it themselves."

WhatsApp Gold scam – what is it, and how to avoid it?

But the second part of the message about WhatsApp Gold is legitimate.

WhatsApp Gold is a notable scam, as Sophos explains: "'WhatsApp Gold' scam messages have, for at least two and a half years and via varyingly worded messages, claimed that the new 'premium service' would get users extra goodies, such as video calling and new emojis.

"Users who clicked on the link got no goodies. They got baddies, in the form of a non-WhatsApp website that told them to download malware nicknamed 'WhatsApp Gold'."

So the "martinelli" text at least partly right: if you receive a message about WhatsApp Gold, don't pass it on and don't click any links.

According to Sophos, you should avoid forwarding the message, and regularly read up on the latest WhatsApp scams.

"There is nothing new about WhatsApp gold," wrote Sophos.

"Staying safe online means keeping out all the malware that's out there, not just one or two rogue applications you hear about via friends' WhatsApp messages."

Sophos also issued the following advice:
• Get your apps from the App Store or Google Play
• Use security software like Sophos Mobile Security for iOS or Android

International Air Transport Association codes (IATA) are used to identify airports. Often derived using letters from the name of the city the airport is located in, these three letter codes can be quite amusing.

A one way trip to FUK with a stopover in OMG 1:22

TOURISTS in Paris are warning others after a cabbie tried to scam them into paying almost five times the real cost of a taxi — and then got angry when they refused.

The couple, from Thailand, filmed an incident in which a taxi driver tried to charge them an eye-watering fee of €247 ($385) for a 45km ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city centre.

Official Paris cabs charge a flat rate from the airport of €50 ($78) to anywhere on the Right Bank of Paris and €55 ($86) to anywhere on the Left Bank. It’s based on rules introduced in 2016.

Subscribe to news.com.au’s From The Newsroom podcast

But in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube, the driver angrily insists his €247 fee is correct and argues with the couple after they challenge it.

He tells the couple taxi fees in Paris were “not fixed price. It’s by (the) meter.” The meter appears to be an app on the driver’s phone.

The video shows the driver getting angry when the couple demand to see his licence. He also lunges towards the back seat to stop one of the tourists filming him with his phone.

At one point, the couple ask to be taken to a police station so they can sort out the matter.

“I’m not going to police. You pay me, you go to police. What is your problem?” the driver tells them.

After many tense minutes of arguing, the couple eventually agree to pay a compromise price of €200 ($311) so they can finally get out of the cab.

One of the tourists, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, told Le Parisien the driver had locked the doors.

“The doors were locked, and we had all our luggage in the trunk,” he said, according to a translation by The Independent.

“He did not want to let us out, and kept driving while (supposedly) phoning his company to find a compromise.”

“So, we decided to pay €200 to get out.”

The driver said he belonged to Chauffeur Prive. It is a legitimate company but its website advertises a flat rate of €45 ($70), The Independent reported.

The couple has already left Paris, but police are understood to be investigating the incident.

They said they wanted their experience to be “a case study for other Thai people or travellers to be conscious while they are travelling.”

The video has clocked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube.

Paris is the third most visited city in the world, with 17.44 million tourists visiting in 2017.

On its website, Paris Airport advises visitors to say no to people posed as taxi drivers who approach them outside the baggage claim area, as official drivers operate this way.

Visitors should go outside the terminal for the dedicated taxi area and look for an illuminated sign on the outside of the cab and a meter on the inside.

The airport also says visitors can pre-book taxis through the official site for peace of mind.

OTHER SCAMS TO WATCH FOR IN EUROPE

Ash Zaman, travel safety expert from Travel Insurance Direct, said there was a variety of common crimes targeting tourists in Europe this year.
• The “there’s something on your shirt!” scam: A foul substance such as fake bird droppings or mustard is splashed on to your shirt, and while a “helpful stranger” cleans it off for you someone picks your pocket.
• The infamous “gold ring” scam: A passer-by stops you and says you’ve dropped something, and shows you a “gold” ring. It’s either a distraction technique — and your pocket is picked — or they insist you pay them a reward for finding it.
• “There’s something wrong with your car!” scam: As you’re driving a car pulls alongside and the driver indicates there’s something drastically wrong with the rear of your vehicle. You stop, and as you and the stranger go to inspect the problem an accomplice makes off with your wallet/purse from the front seat.
• Hotel rats of Paris: Gangs of thieves are disguising themselves as tourists and infiltrating hotels around Paris. Some of them are opportunistic and will hang out in the lobby waiting for luggage and personal belongings to be left unattended before swooping.

Others are a bit more sophisticated and will actually check into hotels popular with tourists and then break into other hotel rooms to steal valuables.
• Moped gangs of London: Groups of armed thieves are roaming the streets on mopeds and scooters mugging and assaulting unassuming pedestrians and motorists. This includes tourist who are seen as easy prey. These gangs have a propensity for violence and are usually armed with bats, axes, knifes and won’t hesitate in using force to get their way.

If you’ve fallen victim to pickpockets, scams or other crimes on holiday, make sure you notify the police immediately and contact your travel insurer’s emergency assistance team should you need any medical assistance.

INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - An Indianapolis woman is warning people after someone scammed her out of hundreds of dollars. It happened after the same man pretended to be the landlord for a rental property advertised online.

The victim in this case handed over almost every penny she had, hoping she had hit the jackpot for a place on Shelby Street in Indianapolis to call home sweet home.

Tammy Cleary lives on a fixed income. She barely has enough money to make it to the next month after forking out money for her monthly bills. She is doing everything possible to fight back tears about someone taking advantage of her at a dire time of need.

"I am trying not to cry. Just trying to keep the faith and not cry so much," Cleary said.

Still, Tammy is holding out hope as long as possible and praying that the man she paid rent to didn't scam her out of cash. She searched Craigslist for an apartment last week and thought she found just what she needed.

Tammy found a double for rent in the 2700 block of Shelby Street. She is already on the waiting list for a subsidized apartments through Housing and Urban Development, but she had hoped to find a place until landing a HUD location.

"I got the phone number and his name is Shawn Adams and I left a message several times. He called me back," Cleary said.

During the phone call about the Shelby Street property, the so-called landlord told Tammy she could move in right away. They met in person at a library on East Washington Street where he gave her instructions on closing the deal.

"He said to go get the cash," said Cleary. "I brought back $450. He said he would go get the keys and meet me between 4 and 4:30."

Tammy showed Eyewitness News the lease she signed which he wrote his name and number on too. She waited at the Shelby Street property for hours for him to bring the keys.

"He did not show up," she said.

Eventually, Tammy met the family who already lives in the residence she had planned on renting. They explained their landlord is a woman. They had no clue about the man she paid money to for a deposit.

A neighbor who has lived on Shelby Street for 14 years told Eyewitness News that the actual owner of the property in question lives in California. The local landlord is a woman who even confirmed that the property had been rented out earlier this year and should not be listed for rent on anyone’s website, especially Craigslist.

"The guy named Shawn Adams told me to come over here because he told me to meet him here and he would give me keys to this address," Cleary said. "She said, 'I am sorry we just moved in here.'"

Cleary admits she never got a chance to see the inside of the apartment before giving the rent money. It's something she advises others to do, even if you sign a lease which can easily be printed from the web.

Now, after losing hundreds of dollars, Tammy is warning others about handing over your money to people you meet online.

"Do not trust anybody anymore and do not go to the bank when they ask you to bring them cash back," she said.

There are security cameras at the library where Tammy met the so-called landlord. She also plans to contact Craigslist about the fake rental ad.

If you have any information that could help in this case, call Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS.

A telephone solicitor has recently been calling area residents asking for donations to help the local fire department.

The West Salem Volunteer Fire Department said that the calls sometimes come in as unknown or from a 717 (Harrisburg) area code.

According to the fire department, the caller claims that the donations will provide fire prevention materials and PTSD to the local fire department.

Officials are warning that the West Salem Fire Department is not affiliated with these callers They say they have never been contacted by them or received calls from them.

Authorities say that if you receive a call regarding something of this nature, collect their information and check with your local fire department to assure that they are not associated with them.

If they are not associated with the caller, please report the solicitation to the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection.

A Halls Head woman is warning residents of a new phone scam after she was almost tricked into revealing personal information to a caller claiming to be from the federal government.

Veronica Greenham received a call earlier this week informing her that her registration on the ‘Do Not Call’ list would expire the next day.

“He told me I only had that afternoon to fix the issue and that he could help me,” Mrs Greenham said.

“But then he started to ask me very personal questions and I started to get suspicious.”

After refusing to reveal her details, Mrs Greenham proceeded to ask the caller what government department he was phoning from, which is when he abruptly hung up.

“I know for a fact the next question would be for my bank details and that I had to pay a small fee.

“I could feel it coming, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

“The guy was really slick for the first few minutes and it gave me a fright that he managed to keep me talking as long as he did.”

Mrs Greenham called the telecommunications ombudsmen and a number of government officials to find out about the scam and confirm her place on the ‘Do Not Call’ register.

She was informed that there were no plans to dismantle the register.

ScamNet reports that many Western Australians receive phone calls from scammers claiming to be from the federal government.

Mrs Greenham and her husband want to warn the Mandurah community, particularly the elderly, who they believed would be the prime target for the scam.

“I’m angry that I nearly got caught and I really hope nobody else does,” she said.

“I don’t know if they target older people but I doubt I’m the only one.

Holiday shoppers hold onto your wallets — literally. The frenzied deals and discounts that kick off Thanksgiving Day and run through Cyber Monday will bring out the fraudsters, too, along with everyday consumers.

Most people will still hit the malls and discount stores. But more than 40 percent of holiday shoppers will make nearly all of their purchases online, according to a new survey on Holiday Shopping and the Impact of Fraud by TransUnion.

When it comes to security, six out of 10 shoppers say the most important thing a web site can do is protect their account information and credit card information, according to the holiday survey.

And 88 percent of those surveyed said they are willing to go through additional steps at checkout when shopping online to ensure the safety of their information.

Here are eight ways to keep your money safe through the holiday shopping season:

Crooks still are more than happy to get their hands on physical credit cards. Don't leave your wallet in your car. Don't casually leave your purse in a shopping cart while you're walking over to grab some dinner rolls out of the supermarket freezer section.

Pickpockets are likely to act fast and take use those stolen credit cards to buy gift cards, electronics or even fill their tank with gas.

Costco Wholesale isn't giving away a $75 coupon to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

"The scam provided links which led to web pages (which were not operated or sponsored by Costco) that displayed a Costco logo along with entreaties such as 'You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get a Free $75 Costco Coupon! We only have 332 Coupons remaining so hurry up!'" according to the website Snopes.com.

If you followed the instructions, you then asked to fill out your name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, and phone numbers. You'd be asked to complete a lengthy series of surveys, and commit to paying "reward offers."

“With social media advertisements becoming more and more popular, it’s likely consumers will see something they like and click on the link without thinking of the repercussions," said Laura Blankenship, director of community relations for the Better Business Bureau Serving Eastern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.

If you spot a website that's offering new UGG or Frye books for $50, well, the boots and the site are likely to be fake.

Keep any eye out for red flags, including strange looking URLs and descriptions that do not make sense. Sometimes, crooks will lure you in with an unbelievably good deal.

“Open a separate tab and search the business yourself,” Blankenship said.

"If you have never heard of the retailer or know very little about them, it’s important to look at their reviews and see whether or not they’re a reputable company, especially during the holiday season.”

Be extra careful not to blindly trust emails that appear to be from a well-known retailer or delivery service. Hackers try to impersonate brand names, too.

4. Look out for skimmers

Check out any ATM to look for signs that there might be a skimmer device, which could steal card information. Legitimate ATMs don't have loose parts.

Take extra care when using a card at a gas station pump, too. Crooks also install skimming devices there, as well.

If you didn't shop for deals on Thanksgiving, call your bank immediately if you spot an odd purchase.

Keep track of your online shopping. Remember what you bought and where you shopped. It can help you spot unauthorized charges.

Massive data breaches continue to happen — such as one that hit British Airways customers in the summer. Stolen data shows up for sale on the dark web quickly. So even if you just got a new credit card number because of an earlier breach, don't get too comfortable. The new number may get out there, too.

6. Take advantage of gadgets to spot fraud

Ally Bank, for example, has an "Ally Card Controls" app that allows cardholders to keep their debit card active around their phone, or only within a specified region.

So if you're in Michigan, a transaction could be denied in Texas, for example.

The app allows customers to prevent purchases at specific categories of retailers, such as those selling groceries, fuel, entertainment or travel. Cardholders can disable online shopping to avoid unauthorized purchases, and turn it on instantly if they want to buy something online.

Tempting as it is to use downtime at the Starbucks to knock a few items off the list, don't do it. Your financial information is too vulnerable on public networks.

Cyber Monday is another hot day for cyber crooks.

Shoppers are advised to pull out a credit card if they're shopping online or ordering by phone, instead of a debit card.

If your credit card number is compromised, it's easier to dispute any charges that you didn't approve, according to the Better Business Bureau.

A debit card is linked directly to a checking account, so you could have more problems if that number gets hijacked.

Another tip: Use a credit card when buying a big ticket item because a credit card offers more protections if there is a problem with the product or a dispute.

To save money, of course, you don't want to carry a balance on the credit cards to avoid interest charges.

The Better Business Bureau serving the greater West Virginia and Canton area is offering tips and advice for consumers to avoid fraudulent practices.

Trying to buy a home? Get a new job? Take out a loan? Then you care about your credit score.

Scammers know this, and they are using related scare tactics to get consumers to give up sensitive personal information.

You receive an email from a top credit reporting company (such as TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax) asserting there is a problem with your credit report. The email contains the logos of the companies it claims to represent and looks legitimate. The email says there is a problem with your credit score, perhaps due to a security breach, and your score has been updated.

You want to find out what happened! The email prompts you to click a link or download a PDF to view your new credit score.

When you click, you could unknowingly download malware to your computer, giving scammers access to your system.

Be suspicious of unsolicited emails. If you think the correspondence is real, confirm it by visiting the company’s official website or calling them. Just be sure to find the phone number on their website, not in the potential scam email.

Don’t click on links when you are not sure of the sender. Never click on links in suspicious emails or text messages.

Never give in to fear. Scammers want you to panic and take immediate action.

Stay vigilant, ask questions, and do your research before making a decision.

Order your free credit report once a year from each of the three major reporting agencies from AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling 877-322-8228. Review your report to be certain it doesn’t include accounts that you have not opened.

A New Jersey prosecutor was set to announce developments Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018, in a criminal investigation of the couple that raised $400,000 for Bobbitt Jr, a homeless man they said helped them with a disabled car. Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina planned to discuss the matter during a news conference. He declined to provide further details about the announcement or whether criminal charges would be brought in the case. (Elizabeth Robertson /The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP, File) /The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)

MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) — The Latest on charges brought against a New Jersey couple and a homeless man allegedly involved in charitable scam (all times local):

Authorities say a New Jersey couple and a homeless man made up a "feel good" story about the man helping them so they could raise money through an online fundraiser.

Burlington County prosecutors outlined the allegations against Mark D'Amico, Katelyn McClure and Johnny Bobbitt on Thursday. All three are charged with theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception.

The couple has claimed they set up a GoFundMe page for Bobbitt after he helped McClure get gas when she became stranded in Philadelphia last year. But prosecutors say they found evidence all three knew each other for at least a month before and set up the scheme.

D'Amico and McClure surrendered Wednesday night. Their attorney said they have no comment. Bobbitt is jailed in Philadelphia. A previous lawyer of his didn't return a call seeking comment.

Authorities say a homeless man who benefited from a GoFundMe page set up by a New Jersey couple they said helped them with a disabled car has been arrested.

A Philadelphia prisons spokeswoman says Johnny Bobbitt was brought in Wednesday night by U.S. marshals and remained in custody Thursday on probation detainers and a $50,000 bond.

The development came as a New Jersey prosecutor planned to announce developments in a criminal investigation related to the fundraiser that raised $400,000 for Bobbitt.

The couple have denied any wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not answer a phone call.

The couple claim Bobbitt bought Katelyn McClure gas late one night when she was stranded in Philadelphia.

Bobbitt's lawyer says he has been told the money is gone. It's unclear what happened.

A New Jersey prosecutor says he will announce developments in a criminal investigation of a couple that raised $400,000 for a homeless man they said helped them with a disabled car.

Investigators searched the Florence home of Mark D'Amico and Katelyn McClure in September after questions arose about what happened to the money they raised through a GoFundMe page.

They denied wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not answer a phone call.

They are being sued by the homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt.

The couple told reporters he bought McClure gas late one night when she was stranded in Philadelphia.

Bobbitt's lawyer says he has been told the money is gone. It's unclear what happened.

A charity that supports pensioners has urged a national banking chain to drop proposals to shut branches in Moray.

The Bank of Scotland announced this week that its sites in Keith and Lossiemouth will close in May and June next year.

The move has already been met with criticism locally by campaigners who have vowed to gather support to press bosses to reverse the decision.

>> Keep up to date with the latest news with The P&J newsletter

Now the charity Age Scotland has joined the calls, stressing that a “substantial proportion” of older residents are only comfortable doing their baking face-to-face.

Chief executive Brian Sloan said shutting branches was an “easy route” to save money and has the Bank of Scotland to instead draw up “innovative” solutions – including shared facilities for rural areas.

He said: “Physical branches are important to older people.

“As older people are more likely to be targeted by scams, they’re less likely to go online or use the phone for banking and they shouldn’t be disadvantaged for making this choice.

“One caller to our helpline told us that after forgetting her account password, a telephone advisor told her she would have to ‘pop-in’ to her nearest branch.

“The only problem was that she lived in rural Perthshire and the closest one involved a journey of nearly two hours on two different buses.”

Bank of Scotland has stressed that both Keith and Lossiemouth branches have post office facilities nearby to allow customers to access cash facilities.

Meanwhile, the firm has announced that a mobile service will be launched in the two towns ahead of the closures.

The bank has blamed dwindling footfall for the move and has released figures showing that only 24 customers used the Lossiemouth counters weekly while 15 visit Keith.

Yesterday, Moray MSP Richard Lochhead wrote to the company to request discussions about the issue.

Moray MP Douglas Ross has also organised meetings in the towns next week in order to speak to locals about the difficulties they could face.

He said: “I’ve invited the bank, community councillors, business representatives and post office officials to allow a full discussion on all options.”

The meetings will take place at Lossiemouth Community Centre on Thursday and Longmore Hall in Keith on Friday. Both start at 7pm.

PETALING JAYA: From telemarketers offering credit cards and insurance to criminal Macau scam syndicates, Malaysian mobile phone users are being hounded by a fast-rising number of spam calls.

Anti-spam mobile application Truecaller said that its 1.7 million users in Malaysia received more than 30 million spam calls this year alone which the app managed to block.

“To give you an example of how fast this problem is growing, since January, we’ve seen a 100% increase in spam calls,” said Truecaller’s director of communications Kim Fai Kok.

Truecaller claims to have 250 million users worldwide and has offices in Sweden, United States and India.

There were 10.8 million postpaid mobile phone users and 33.3 million prepaid users in Malaysia up to end-June this year, according to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

Kim said Truecaller users in Malaysia receive an average of six spam calls a month, the second highest in South-East Asia after Indonesia where users get an average of eight. Users in Singapore and Thailand receive four respectively, while in Vietnam the figure is even lower at two, said Kim.

He said the major driver of spam calls in Malaysia are those offering financial services, which account for 67% of the spam calls.

Typically, these are banking product offers or cold calls from credit card companies.

Another major problem that Malaysians have to deal with is unsolicited telemarketing calls that make up 13% of total spam calls reported.

Kim said telemarketing calls can further be broken down into promotional calls from companies, surveys being done by analytics firms on behalf of their clients, or new client outreach for services and subscriptions.

Another 9% are calls from insurance companies offering to sell different types of policies, while calls from telecommunications companies selling data and offering promotions make up another 4%. The remaining 6% are debt collection, nuisance and scam calls.

The Personal Data Protection Act 2010 regulates and protects the use of personal data collected by companies including banks, hotels and airlines.

An individual who keeps getting spam calls from any of these companies and feels that their personal data may have been processed in breach of any provision of the Act can make a complaint to the Personal Data Protection Commissioner.

However, some spam calls come from firms that the user has not given any personal details to previously. Others are from scammers such as the Macau syndicate.

The MCMC when contacted advised the public to be vigilant and take precautionary measures whenever receiving calls from unknown numbers.

These includes lodging a complaint to the commission on the matter, which can be channelled to aduanskmm@mcmc.gov.my.

In a recent post on the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) Facebook page, police advised smartphone users to install mobile apps that block spam calls and messages.

Statistics from the Communica­tions and Multimedia Ministry showed that telecommunications fraud cases involved an estimated RM162.6mil this year alone, with the Macau Scam being the most common.

Kuala Lumpur Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) chief Asst Comm Mohd Luthfi Ismail Abdullah said while spam call-blocking apps could be beneficial, members of the public should not solely depend on them to prevent them from being victims of scams, especially Macau scams, as the number of cases has increased significantly recently.

“We must always stay vigilant and suspicious of numbers that could be from scammers. The best thing to do is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers.

“Avoiding conversation with these scammers is the best way to avoid becoming victims,” he said.

For Macau scams, ACP Mohd Luthfi reminded the public that the authorities, such as the police and Bank Negara, would not call them directly regarding official matters.

“Do not believe it if out of the blue, someone claiming to be the police or from other agencies, calls you to inform that you are being investigated or even that your account has been frozen.

“If you receive such suspicious calls and talk to these scammers, call the authorities directly, don’t follow the number given by the scammers,” he said.

A Macau Scam often starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be an officer from a bank, government agency or debt collector.

The scammer will then claim that the potential victim owes money or has an unpaid fine, often with a very short window of less than an hour to settle the payment or face dire consequences.

The unsuspecting victims will then be asked to make payments to get them off the hook.

According to the PDRM Facebook post, spam blocking apps typically work by gathering phone numbers that have already been reported.

While there is no guarantee that such apps can completely stop scammers, smartphone users can reduce the risks, the police said.

Some may be wary about giving permissions to an app such as Truecaller.

After all, the app’s privacy policy states that contact information collected and used would include phone numbers as well as attached names, Google IDs and e-mail addresses from one’s address book.

However Kim assures that: “People can use Truecaller without sharing their contacts, but to get the best experience we need certain permissions.

“To give you an example, True­caller also works as a phone and SMS app.

“The value we provide with our dialer is that we put a name to number in your call history – which is extremely helpful. And for the SMS feature we automatically help filter out spam messages and keep your inbox clean from being cluttered.”

If you don’t want to install another app, some phone makers like Samsung include spam call protection in their phones.

This feature can be turned on from the dialler app. Open the app, click the three dots on the top right hand corner and then pick Settings. Scroll down and you will see the option Caller ID and Spam Protection.

To turn it on you will have to also agree to share your contacts with the service Hiya, a caller ID and blocking service.

TOURISTS in Paris are warning others after a cabbie tried to scam them into paying almost five times the real cost of a taxi — and then got angry when they refused.

The couple, from Thailand, filmed an incident in which a taxi driver tried to charge them a fee of €247 (£218) for a 45km ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city centre.

Official Paris cabs charge a flat rate from the airport of €50 (£44) to anywhere on the Right Bank of Paris and €55 (£48) to anywhere on the Left Bank. It’s based on rules introduced in 2016.

But in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube, the driver angrily insists his €247 (£218) fee is correct and argues with the couple after they challenge it.

He tells the couple taxi fees in Paris were “not fixed price. It’s by (the) meter,” but the meter appears to be an app on the driver’s phone.

The video shows the driver getting angry when the couple demand to see his licence, and lunging towards the back seat to stop one of the tourists filming him with his phone.

At one point, the couple ask to be taken to a police station so they can sort out the matter but he tells them: “I’m not going to police. You pay me, you go to police. What is your problem?”

After many tense minutes of arguing, the couple eventually agree to pay a compromise price of €200 (£176) so they can finally get out of the cab.

One of the tourists, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, told Le Parisien the driver had locked the doors.

According to a translation by the Independent, he said: “The doors were locked, and we had all our luggage in the trunk - he did not want to let us out, and kept driving while (supposedly) phoning his company to find a compromise.”

“So, we decided to pay €200 to get out.”

The driver said he belonged to Chauffeur Prive. It is a legitimate company but its website advertises a flat rate of €45 (£39), The Independent reported.

The couple has already left Paris, but police are understood to be investigating the incident - the video has clocked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube.

Paris is the third most visited city in the world, with 17.44 million tourists visiting in 2017.

On its website, Paris Airport advises visitors to say no to people posed as taxi drivers who approach them outside the baggage claim area, as no official drivers operate this way.

Visitors should instead go outside the terminal to the dedicated taxi area and look for an illuminated sign on the outside of the cab and a meter on the inside.

The airport also says visitors can pre-book taxis through the official site for peace of mind.

Earlier this summer, Palma Airport warned Brits against ten common scams such as dodgy taxis, Wi-Fi scams and pickpocketing in the airport.

In Benidorm, tourists were also being scammed by fellow Brits in “pea scam” games that are rife in the holiday resort, meanwhile in the Lake District, tourists have been targeted by fake plain-clothes police who ‘pretend to carry out routine security bag checks’ then steal items.

Holidaymakers also had £6.7 million stolen by fraudsters last year through online booking scams - mainly through fake airline tickets and accommodation.

Most recently, the Hollywood actor James McAvoy was nearly scammed out of thousands of pounds after trying to book a Tenerife holiday with a fake booking site.

A woman living in Lincoln was scammed out of £2,500 after a call from a person claiming to work for her banking group, Barclays bank.

The caller told the woman on October 19 that they had to open a new bank account for her and that she needed to transfer £2,500 into the account, which she did.

The woman was then told to attend an appointment at her local Barclays bank a couple of days later, but when she turned up she was told by staff they knew nothing about it.

This is one of several telephone scams that have been reported across Lincolnshire to police this month and they area reminding people to stay vigilant.

In a number of other cases the caller claims to be from either HMRC or the police, threatening an arrest, a lawsuit or telling the victims that they are under investigation, to get them to pay money.

Lincolnshire Police said: “Please be aware that not all calls are the same and criminals can continue to change tactics.

“We are also asking for members of the public to tell their elderly family members and friends about of this fraud, and to raise as much awareness as possible.

“We are also reminding people of our Operation Signature campaign. This campaign has been launched to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud in Lincolnshire.

“Fraud is a hidden and under-reported crime with victims often in denial or unaware of the criminality behind it. Increasingly fraud is becoming more complex and sophisticated, much of which is targeted at vulnerable and elderly people.”

Operation Signature is a standardised reporting and recording process, to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud.

FAIRBANKS—Fairbanks police are warning the public not to reveal their Social Security numbers or other banking information to unknown callers after a local woman was swindled out of $26,000 in a telephone scam.

According to a post on the Fairbanks Police Department's Facebook page Wednesday, the scammer claimed to be calling from the Social Security Administration and told the woman her bank account had been compromised by someone caught transporting drugs over state lines. The woman was told she needed to move her money out of her account and into a new, more secure bank.

The caller gave the woman bank routing information and told her an Social Security Administration agent would contact her soon to give her a new Social Security number. The woman transferred her money to the new bank account and never heard from the scammer again.

Fairbanks police stress that government agencies do not operate in this fashion and that people should be aware that scammers are getting bolder and actively looking for new victims.

"The Social Security scam has been out there for a long time, but normally people report it's about $3,000 or so that they're asking for," police spokeswoman Yumi McCulloch said Wednesday. "This time it was significantly higher than normal."

A murder trial has been adjourned at the Central Criminal Court after jurors were targeted in what’s thought to be a phone scam, where the caller claimed to be from the Courts Service.

The jurors were serving in the trial of a father-of-five, who shot his friend dead and dismembered his remains, which were later found in the Grand Canal.

The jurors had spent the first part of the day on Tuesday hearing the contents of garda interviews carried out with Paul Well Snr, who was denying involvement in Kenneth O’Brien’s murder.

The 50-year-old of Barnamore Park in Finglas has now admitted shooting dead his fellow Dubliner and dismembering his body. However, he has pleaded not guilty to murdering the 33-year-old at his home in Barnamore Park on 15th or 16th January, 2016.

He claims that the deceased had wanted him to murder Mr O’Brien’s partner, so that he could take their child back to Australia, where he had previously lived.

The jury heard evidence on Tuesday of what Mr Wells had said in half a dozen interviews, including telling gardaí that they should go to Australia to find out why Mr O’Brien was murdered. He also said he could not say why the deceased had transferred more than €50,000 into his account.

The 11 jurors were asked to go to their jury room while the parties arranged the next portion of interviews to be played on DVD. However, when they returned to court, they informed the judge of other developments.

The foreman said that both he and another juror had received missed calls from the same Dublin number in the space of half an hour. The other juror had also received a voicemail.

“It was distorted,” he said. “You could just make out Courts Service.”

Mr Justice Paul McDermott sent the jury away again, later calling all 11 back to say that a preliminary investigation had indicated that the call was part of a scam.

He called the officer, who had carried out the enquiries, Sergeant Gerard Moore.

“It appears to be a scam,” he testified, explaining that people would dial the number from which the missed call would come.

“They’re eliciting information as opposed to giving information,” he said of what would be heard on the other side.

Justice McDermott said that it appeared that it was nothing to do with the murder case and nothing to do with anything the jury had heard in court.

“I hope you’re reassured by that,” he said.

He said that, in order for this investigation to be fully concluded, he would ask for the phones to be made available to a garda, who could listen to the voicemail.

“We can resume tomorrow when the investigation is completed,” he said, adjourning the murder trial until Wednesday morning.

Sgt Martin Long had testified earlier that he was involved in interviewing the accused following his arrest on suspicion of murder.

He said that Mr Wells said nobody else had access to his bank account and denied Mr O’Brien had owed him any money.

He explained that he was in receipt of Jobseeker’s Benefit of €320 a week and that the most he would have in his bank account would be a few hundred euro.

The gardaí then asked if he could tell them about the €14,500 he had withdrawn from that account that January.

“No, I can’t,” he replied. “It’s not in my possession anyway.”

He was asked if it had anything to with the murder of Mr O’Brien.

“No,” he insisted. “I wasn’t involved in any of his activities.”

He agreed that the €52,925 that had been transferred into his account over the previous 18 months had belonged to Mr O’Brien.

“A man was murdered. A lot of his money goes into your account,” remarked the gardaí, explaining that they needed to find out what happened.

“You’d better go to Australia then,” replied Mr Wells.

SCOTT COUNTY, Ky. (LEX 18) -The Scott County Sheriff’s office says an influx of innocent people have turned themselves in to deputies after receiving a scam call saying there was a warrant for their arrest.

Investigators are receiving reports that a person identifying himself as Lt. Kevin Price is calling people from a 502 area code and instructing people to come to the Sheriff’s Office and pay fines associated with warrants.

The Scott Co. Sheriff says that no one will call you about warrants or ask for a payment over the phone. If you have warrants, a deputy will meet you in person.

If you are on Medicare, you only have three weeks left to pick out a plan for coverage in 2019.

But how do you know which plan is best, and how do you avoid the Medicare scams that are targeting seniors right now.

Commercials are in full swing selling Medicare Advantage coverage plans, but how do you know what's legitimate or a scam? We turned to Raymond Hurd, a Regional Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He warned about any phone calls or personal visits.

"We're never going to call you, so if somebody calls and says they represent Medicare, it's probably a fraud. If they're trying to tell you that you can get something for free, that Medicare's going to pay for, it's probably a fraud," said Hurd.

About two-thirds of Medicare recipients get benefits through government-run original Medicare. The other third enrolls in Medicare Advantage plans. But with Advantage plans you must make sure your doctors are in-network for maximum reimbursement. And just like private health insurance companies, there are different Medicare Advantage plans.

"Some Medicare Advantage plans may cover hearing or vision and others may not. Their monthly premiums may vary too, so you need to sort of shop around and see what best fits your needs," he said.

Hurd says it's best to go to medicare.gov online to compare plans that are best for your needs or call 1-800-medicare, where a rep will explain each plan or refer you to a local counselor.

"I get feel good stories every year from counselors, from people that save hundreds of dollars because they switched to a different plan," said Hurd.

Every year Advantage plans change in cost, coverage and providers and it's projected that the average basic monthly premium for a Part D prescription drug plan is going to be the lowest in several years. So we can verify to avoid fraud, it's best that you initiate your research on a legitimate government site.

SAN ANGELO, TX - The San Angelo Police Department warns that the "Grandparent Scam" is, once again, targeting San Angelo residents in order to get personal information.

The grandparent scam typically involves a call from someone pretending to be your grandchild. The person explains that he/she is in trouble, with a story that goes something like this: “There’s been an accident and I’m in jail/in the hospital/stuck in a foreign country and I need your help.” The caller adds enough details about how, what or where the emergency happened to make the story seem plausible.

Often the caller tells you that a third person, such as a lawyer, doctor, or police officer, will “explain everything to you” if you call him/her.

“This makes it seem more real when you call and talk to the authority,” says attorney Kati Daffan, assistant director of the division of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The caller later asks you to send or wire money immediately.

In 2017 nearly one in five people reported losing money in an impostor scheme like the grandparent scam, amounting to a loss of $328 million, according to the FTC. Those ages 70 and older have suffered the highest average losses.

Scammers can buy lead lists of people who’ve been scammed before, people who are older, or people they can get a lot of personal information about. Sometimes the information is gathered from social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, or by hacking into email accounts.

If this situations happens to you, determine if the emergency is real. Verify the person’s identity by asking questions someone else couldn't possibly answer. Also, check with a family member or the person who supposedly called you.

If you’re a victim of a grandparent scam or another form of fraud, report it to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint or by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP.

SAN ANTONIO — CPS Energy reports several San Antonio customers have received calls about individuals posing as utility employees asking for payment.
• Scammers will ask for money in the form a gift cards or prepaid debit cards
• CPS says they will never call customers to threaten them

"Basically what this is, is a scam," CPS Energy spokesperson John Moreno said. "Calling our customers, demanding money, threatening to cut off service. Quite frankly, CPS Energy does not do business that way."

Moreno said CPS Energy calls customers to remind them of past due bills, but never to threaten them.

"They fear that their service will be cut off so maybe they fall victim to these scams,” Moreno said. “No one is excluded from this, this happens not only in San Antonio but it happens across the country."

One customer who wanted to remain anonymous said he got a call from what he thought was CPS Energy. He didn't think twice when the caller asked for him to load $450 onto a prepaid debit card and pay over the phone.

"The customer may see 210-353-2222 pop up on their Caller ID, and it even says CPS Energy," Moreno said. "But when they ask you to make a payment, they're giving you an 1-800 number and they're asking you to buy a prepaid debit card."

CPS Energy recently became a member of Utilities United Against Scams, which has helped to shut down more than 2,000 toll free numbers.

"That's why we want customers to be vigilant and hang up and call us when they receive any type of call that says "you owe us money, you must pay immediately, or we're going to cut you off. That's an immediate red flag," Moreno said.

SPOKANE, Wash. - There's an online gift exchange your friends likely tagged you in that is a scam.

Copyright 2018 KXLY.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without prior permission.

The scheme promises you as many as 36 gifts if you purchase one gift for a stranger. This may seem reasonable enough, said the BBB, when you look at it as six friends invite six more friends, who all send gifts to the participant in spot one before the person's named is removed. The process repeats with the person in the second spot, and so on.

But, starting this exchange has a big catch. You have to share your personal information, including your home address.

Copyright 2018 KXLY.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without prior permission.

The Better Business Bureau warned that this online gift exchange and similar invitations are illegal and should be ignored. The campaign, which was first widely spread in 2015, has again started circulating social media sites, especially Facebook.

The BBB said the big problem with this scam is it is a pyramid scheme. The U.S. Postal Inspection Services said that gift exchanges are illegal gambling and participants could be subject to penalties for mail fraud.

As the tax season approaches, Australians have more reasons to be wary of persons claiming to be from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

In the four months since July 1, Australians have lost nearly AU$1 million to scammers posing as the tax officials according to the ATO. During the same period where more than 28,000 scam attempts were reported by the tax body, bitcoin has emerged as the scammers’ preferred method of payment. Previously the use of iTunes vouchers was the most popular method but this has now been overtaken by payments made via Bitcoin ATMs.

The tax body is now warning Australians to be extra careful as the due date for taxes (November 21) approaches saying that the ATO would never ask for debts to be settled via a Bitcoin ATM or other ‘unusual methods’.

“Our advice is simple – the ATO will never ask you to make a payment into an ATM or via gift or pre-paid cards such as iTunes and Visa cards, or direct credit to be paid to a personal bank account,” Kath Anderson, an assistant commissioner at the ATO, said in a statement.

As previously reported by CCN, the methods of payment that the ATO accepts includes direct debit, wire transfer, credit or debit cards and the electronic bill payments platform BPAY.

The success of the tax scammers has come despite numerous warnings being sent out by the Australian Taxation Office. In late September, for instance, the tax body issued a scam alert warning against a fraudulent scheme where victims were being threatened with a jail sentence if they did not immediately clear their tax dues.

One incident involved a man named Darren who received a phone call urging him to pay AU$9,000 in tax dues immediately or risk a five-year jail sentence. To make it seem real, the scammers even called Darren’s tax agent where a planted accomplice of the scammer named Mr. Grey confirmed the tax bill.

“A fake conversation was had between Mr. Grey and the original scammer with Mr. Grey agreeing there was an error with Darren’s tax return and that he owed money to the ATO. Mr. Grey told Darren to go to a specific location and pay the $9,000 today. Darren withdrew cash and deposited it into a Bitcoin [ATM] machine,” a statement from the ATO revealed.

Some of the victims that the scammers have been targeting include the vulnerable such as newly-arrived immigrants who are ignorant of local laws and do not want to end up in jail.

In the latest Around Town column, the city's chief information officer has been accused of violating a state conflict-of-interest law and local agencies are warning the public of scammers.

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? ... A Palo Alto resident who has been leading a neighborhood effort to oppose Verizon's plan to install antennas on city poles has launched a new offensive against the city. Jeanne Fleming, member of the group United Neighbors, has filed a complaint against the city's Chief Information Officer Jonathan Reichental, accusing him of violating the state conflict-of-interest law by allowing a telecom organization to pay for his trip to China in September 2016. The jaunt to Yinchuan is one of eight trips Reichental took in 2016, according to a statement of economic interests that Reichental had filed in February 2017 (other destinations included Dubai, Germany and France). In all cases, he noted in the form, he has "never personally received any money for any of these events." The complaint acknowledges that city employees are allowed to accept travel payments from 501(c)(3) nonprofits, which generally focus on charity and education. The China trip, however, was sponsored by TM Forum, a 501(c)(6) nonprofit, a designation that applies to business groups and chambers of commerce. Fleming maintained the trip seemed to violate the legal $470 limit for gifts that employees are allowed to receive in a given year from a single source (the trip reportedly cost about $5,000). Fleming also suggested in a statement that Reichental's involvement with the telecom industry is related to the City Council's decision in May to reject Fleming's appeal and to approve Verizon's plan to install wireless equipment on 11 poles, notwithstanding the fact that the contentious application was handled by city planners — not the IT Department — and that it followed a similar approval by the Architectural Review Board. The decision, Fleming argued, should be overturned. The Fair Political Practice Commission has confirmed that it had received the complaint, though as of Thursday it has not yet determined whether the complaint warrants an investigation. Reichental said he made a few "clerical errors" which he intends to fix by amending his Form 700. He also said that it is his normal process to get FPPC advice before committing to trips, for which he never gets paid and which are normally paid for by government entities, non-for-profits and educational institutions. In the case of the China trip, it was the Municipality of Yinchuan rather than TM Forum that had paid for the trip (TM Forum, he said, "were only the event coordinators"). "It's my normal practice to call the FPPC advice line before I commit to trips to ensure they are compliant," Reichental said.

DON'T FALL FOR IT ... People posing as employees from two Palo Alto agencies have struck in the community. The Police Department is alerting the public to a scam that swindled a local man out of $10,000. The resident alerted police on Oct. 30 of a cellphone call from someone who claimed to be part of the "immigration office" and told him he was an identity-theft victim. A follow-up call from someone who identified as police Officer Jim Hopper (the department doesn't have an officer by this name) urged him to cooperate with the aforementioned immigration office. A third caller from a different "immigration worker" told the man to load money onto gift cards for new ID cards. Investigators are looking into the case, but want to make clear that an officer wouldn't solicit for a payment by phone. A similar scam has hit Palo Alto Utilities, where people claiming to be department employees call residents and threaten to cut off their electricity unless they pay their overdue bill. To report a scam, call police at 650-329-2413.

NEW CITY, NY — Clarkstown police warn residents not to fall for one of the common scams aimed at the elderly. A caller pretending to be a relative recounts a sad story involving police and the "solution," which includes money from the victim to pay bail, or fines etc.

Often there's a second person involved in the con. In a recent case, it was a "public defender" but other variations include a "desk sergeant" and the like. Clarkstown police said a local resident went to the Home Depot and got a $2,000 gift card because she thought her son needed it to pay for a utility pole knocked down in a car crash.

The Denton County Sheriff’s Office and Argyle Police Department warned residents this week of phone scams targeting local residents.

The Denton County Sheriff’s Office has received several complaints of someone calling and identifying themselves as Denton County deputies, the sheriff’s office said in a social media post. The scammer(s) are advising people they have outstanding warrants or owe money to the courts and are demanding payments. “The Denton County Sheriff’s Office will not call and demand payments of any kind,” the Facebook post said Wednesday.

Argyle police have also received similar reports of a scammer using an Argyle officer’s name and requesting payment over the phone.

If you get a similar call, hang up and contact your local law enforcement agency.

It was May 2017, and he was in the middle of interviewing a middle-aged woman from New Hampshire. After more than an hour, Hastbacka still knew almost nothing about her.

The woman had come in for questioning after Hastbacka received a tip about suspicious behavior while she was working a new job as a grant writer for the city of Nashua. In short, Hastbacka was told, the woman was caught asking for the wiring instructions for city bank accounts.

She went by Genna Kaplan. But Hastbacka immediately suspected something was amiss.

There was no record of any Genna Kaplan living in the state of New Hampshire. In fact, there was no trace of a Genna Kaplan in her age bracket having ever existed.

Pressed by Hastbacka, Kaplan finally coughed up her real name: Dana Lawrence. But she wouldn’t reveal much else, and she left almost no digital footprint.

“It was unique because there was nothing there," Hastbacka said. "She was a ghost.”

“She had no credit cards, not a single bank account," he added. "And most people have a bank account with a debit card. She didn't even have a debit card. The phones she was using were all drop phones; pay as you go.”

By then, Hastbacka was confident that he had enough to charge her for using someone else’s social security number.

Hastbacka took Lawrence into the backseat of his FBI vehicle to transfer her into federal custody.

“She challenged me that I only knew 20 percent of what she's done over the years, and I would never be able to figure it out,” Hastbacka said. “So, challenge accepted.”

That taunting challenge from Lawrence resulted in Hastbacka learning that she wasn’t your run-of-the-mill con artist.

Over the next several weeks, the scope of Lawrence’s decades-long, cross-country crime spree would come into focus.

The FBI found evidence that she had built a life of lies in order to swindle at least seven unsuspecting victims — including a pilot, rabbi and a boyfriend’s mother — out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, authorities say.

Lawrence had evaded law enforcement for more than 20 years by using 19 different aliases across 16 states, the FBI says. All the while, the FBI says, she was carrying out schemes that ranged from her pretending she was pregnant to posing as an Ivy League-educated attorney.

At times, Lawrence even used her young daughter as her prop, the FBI says. These frauds included telling victims she needed money because her “niece’s” parents had died in a car crash.

Hastbacka and the other investigators also learned that Lawrence had a total of six children with six different men, leaving a dozen damaged lives in her wake, not including all of her other victims.

The crumbling of a house of cards

NBC News made multiple attempts to contact Lawrence through her website, social media accounts and associates. She never returned the requests for comment.

The crumbling of Lawrence’s house of cards was set in motion after she offered her services as a grant writer for the Nashua mayor’s office in the fall of 2016.

Kim Kleiner, the mayor’s chief of staff, was happy to have the help. Nashua was in need of a new soccer field and a playground for the local elementary school.

“She seemed excited and she seemed capable. She’s very smart,” Kleiner recalled.

But it didn’t take long before Kleiner and her colleagues noticed something was off with the office’s newest volunteer.

First Lawrence pushed back when told she had to run potential grant applications by her superiors. Then she was found to have tried to get access to the city’s bank account numbers in what she described as part of an effort to solicit grant money, Kleiner said.

“She wanted to know what account that money had to go into, how it worked, who accepted it. Information that I was like, ‘You don’t really need to know that. You just have to have them contact us.’”

“She just lost it,” Kleiner explained, “At one point she broke down in tears and claimed we weren’t being thankful. It was emotional and it was just, odd.”

The most troubling episode came after Kleiner told Lawrence her role with the mayor’s office wasn’t working out.

The next day, “She called my cell and basically threatened me,” Kleiner said. “That she knew things about me, and my husband, and my daughter, and the mayor that she was going to take public. I said, ‘Fine, whatever it is that you think you know, go for it. This is over.’”

For Kleiner, the threats to her family were a tipping point.

Hastbacka received a call from Kleiner, who was an acquaintance, on May 7, 2017. Kleiner “gave me her name, her cell phone number, and the address,” Hastbacka recalled of the phone call. “That's all she knew about her.”

Hastbacka accompanied a local police officer to Lawrence’s home where her boyfriend told them she had left for New York. The boyfriend, Nick Panteleakis, had told the same story when the local officer showed up without Hastbacka days earlier, Hastbacka said.

Fifteen minutes after Hastbacka and the detective left the apartment, Panteleakis called Hastbacka’s cell phone with a different story. “She'd been hiding in the basement the whole time,” Hastbacka recalled. Lawrence agreed to go to the police station for an interview in part, Hasbacka believes, because before he and the detective left her apartment, they’d taken paperwork, a number of cell phones, a laptop and various IDs in different names.

Lawrence initially insisted that she was indeed Genna Kaplan. When Hastbacka told her he knew that she provided someone else’s Social Security number on her apartment rental application, she said she did so because she was running from an abusive ex, according to Hastbacka.

Lawrence finally gave up her name, but her penchant for avoiding bank accounts and credit cards complicated the effort to fill in who she was, the FBI said.

Without much of a paper trail to follow, Hastbacka started Googling the names he had found in the paperwork from her apartment.

The online searches turned up a profile on Ripoff Report, the scam-spotting website. “Nothing had been updated in that site for probably five years,” Hastbacka recalled, “And these victims, over the years, had shared common experiences.”

“This woman is crazy! If you knew her in the past I would suggest that you stay the hell away from her,” one post reads.

“Wish I had some pics to post, but she always made sure to stay away from the camera,” reads another. “Like many of you I too have had the misfortune of meeting this sick individual. Thankfully I was able to get out before it was too late.”

As he dug further into Lawrence’s past, Hastbacka noticed a pattern. She would go on dating websites or visit hotel bars looking for men, and then tell the men she was pregnant with their child, sometimes after just one date, according to Hastbacka.

“She would tell them that she was an Ivy League-educated attorney, that she came from incredible wealth, that her father was deceased, her mother was a doctor with Doctors Without Borders, working in Africa. She said that her family had connections to the royal family. And somehow, you know, she would doctor up photographs to show that.”

Hastbacka said she seemed to target a particular type of man in her schemes, which often involved setting up credit cards in their names.

“They all seemed to be well-to-do professionals — attorneys, pilots, business owners. None of them have ever been married before. None of them had any children from any previous relationship. So most every one of them was looking for that in their life,” he said.

Men weren’t her only victims. In one case, she conned a family out of $10,000 by promising that they could adopt twins from her, only to tell them later that the non-existent children died in a car accident, according to the FBI.

Hastbacka’s digging led him to Kevin Little.

When Little met Lawrence in 2001, he was bartending in Orlando. Lawrence left a $200 tip on a $70 tab. The next night, Little said she came back with a corporate card from Lucasfilm claiming she worked for George Lucas, the Star Wars filmmaker, in New York City.

Lawrence said she was in town to take care of her sick mother, and over the next few days, she continued visiting the bar, ultimately leaving more than $2,200 in tips, Little recalled.

Little and Lawrence ultimately had a one night stand, and not long afterward, she told him she was pregnant with his child. After their daughter Avery was born, Lawrence took Avery and skipped town.

Little eventually won custody of Avery after Lawrence was arrested in New York City in 2005 on fraud charges. He said Avery hasn’t seen her mother since.

Hastbacka said there were some stories that he couldn’t ever forget. “She told one gentleman up in Canada, who's an aspiring actor who she went and stayed with for a few months while she was on the run, that the family had close ties to the actor Jack Nicholson, and that they could arrange for him to get into some of Jack Nicholson's movies.”

“It was heartbreaking to talk to him because he really believed it,” Hastbacka said.

As he pieced together Lawrence’s past, Hastbacka learned that Lawrence had at least six children, each by different fathers.

But one child’s name came up more than the rest.

She used her daughter as a "prop"

Kennedy was Lawrence’s second child. She became a key part of several of Lawrence’s schemes, according to the FBI.

“Kennedy was the one child that she tried her best to keep with her while she was on the run,” Hastbacka said.

Lawrence often portrayed Kennedy as a niece whose parents died from cancer or in a car accident, the FBI said. “Whatever story was most sympathetic at the time,” Hastbacka said.

Hastbacka said Lawrence treated Kennedy not as a daughter but as a “prop.”

While nothing really beats checking the weather than taking a step outside, weather apps are quite useful for getting the forecast for the rest of the week, or even for a different area if you're traveling. Weather Atlas, by Contrast, was a great little weather app that provided accurate forecast info, and Friday, it received a huge overhaul to usability, design and even a new name. Say hello to Weather Up.

The biggest new feature in Weather Up is the Event Forecast. Once you grant Weather Up access to your calendar, Weather Up displays the forecast for your upcoming events. This feature is particularly useful for outdoor events, such as your kid's soccer practice, BBQs, and other activities. It's also convenient to see what the weather is going to be like before you start driving out there.

Keep in mind that you will need a subscription to Weather Up Pro to unlock the Event Forecast feature. A subscription runs $9.99/year or $1.99/month, and also removes ads and supports continued development.

Along with the Event Forecast, there are a ton of other overall improvements. In fact, most of the app was rewritten from the ground up to create a more intuitive and gesture-based interface that meshes incredibly well with the iPhone X, XS, and XS Max. If you used Weather Atlas before, then the changes are immediate when you open Weather Up, but you'll see that it's definitely for the better.

With the new design comes new weather icons. The developer claims that they look good enough to "brighten your day," and we'll admit that they do look nice. In fact, they have also opened up a shop where you can purchase Weather Up gear, if you'd like to wear your favorite cute weather icon.

The mapping in Weather Up is another strong point. You get the standard radar and cloud layer overlay, but there's also temperature, humidity, and precipitation accumulation. For those who live in extreme weather areas, there are warning layers for thunderstorms, tornadoes, and even hurricanes. No matter what weather you live in, Weather Up helps you get prepared.

We've been fans of Contrast's apps for a while now, and Weather Atlas was a great option for getting our forecasts. We're happy to see Weather Up bring a gorgeous new gesture-based interface and the Event Forecast feature is fantastic.

Are you using Weather Up, or do you prefer a different weather app? Let us know in the comments!

Anyone with a credit card has likely been asked to buy balance protection insurance, but our hidden camera investigation revealed the tactics some bank employees use to sell the pricey and controversial product. Go Public also heard from a woman who was on the hook for thousands of dollars even with balance protection.

A series of RCMP raids in India over the Canada Revenue Agency phone scam doesn't mean the threatening messages are likely to stop anytime soon, the Mounties say. The RCMP also say they're looking into Canadians who might be linked to the fraud. The raids followed our investigation into some of the call centres behind the scam.

CIBC was revealed as one of the top companies used by cyber criminals in phishing scams. Research released this week showed CIBC was used in 5.3 new fake email links each day in the third quarter. Bank officials say they are monitoring the situation.

Small internet providers want better access to the big telecom companies' fibre-optic networks and have asked the CRTC to step in. The smaller companies are blocked from accessing the higher speed networks, which they say results in "higher prices and less choice" for consumers.

What else is going on

Lowe's is closing stores across Canada. Most of the 31 locations hit by the closures are Ronas, the Quebec chain that Lowe's bought in 2016. The home improvement retailer is also closing 20 stores in the U.S.

Increased competition for denim is forcing Jean Machine to close. The company announced its 20 stores, all in Ontario, will close by the end of winter. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in January.

These wind-up toys do not meet Canadian safety requirements; these chicken strips could be contaminated with salmonella; these butane gas containers don't have proper hazard labelling; this ladder's platform does not lock securely in place and poses a fall hazard; the inter-lock button could stick on this chainsaw.

The label says Canada grade apple juice, but where do the apples really come from? We go searching for answers and they're leading overseas.

In one case, a scammer kept a victim on the phone long enough that the payment could not be stopped.

New Zealanders are now dealing with 15 per cent more scams than they were a year ago and will have lost $70 million to scammers by Christmas, the Banking Ombudsman estimates.

"Scams are getting more prevalent and more sophisticated," Banking Ombudsman Nicola Sladden said. "We've definitely seen an increase in invoice cases this year."

She said there had been a noticeable increase in telco and invoice scams.

Invoice scams involve a scammer hacking into a legitimate company's email accounts. The scammer sees when client payments are due and emails the client a fake invoice. The logo, signature and format look identical to the company's, but the bank account number on the fake invoice actually belongs to the scammer.

 * Banking ombudsman backs Manawatū retiree's mission to warn elderly about scammers

In a recent case that went to the Banking Ombudsman, a builder received an invoice that appeared to be from a sub-contractor. Thinking it was genuine, the builder paid the money into the designated account. But the sub-contractor's system had been hacked and the invoice was a fake.

By the time the builder realised his funds had gone to the scammer's account, the money had already been cleared and the transaction could not be reversed. Therefore, the builder's bank could not reverse the funds.

"Law firms, real estate agents and construction companies seem to be the most common targets for invoice scams, possibly because they invoice for larger sums of money," Sladden said.

"Most bank account terms and conditions require the customer to check all details are correct before authorising and confirming an online payment. So keep invoice scams in mind if you receive large unexpected payment requests by email.

"Even if you are expecting it, ring your lawyer, real estate agent or sub-contractor on their publicly listed number to double check the bank account number you are paying. Don't use the phone number on the invoice as that could also be fake.

"If you think you have been scammed, contact your bank as soon as possible. There is no guarantee that the funds will be able to be recovered, but the sooner the bank knows the greater the likelihood of a recovery."

Sladden said telco scammers, meanwhile, were using tricks to get on to people's computers or access their personal details.

In another case the scheme dealt with a scammer called the complainant on a Friday afternoon, pretending to be from Spark and saying there was a security breach on her computer. The scammer offered to go in and "clean up" the complainant's computer and secure her bank accounts.

The scammer obtained remote access to the complainant's computer and made two international payments. The bank sent the complainant text verification codes to authenticate the transactions. But the complainant was groomed by the scammer to read the information in the text messages to him.

The scammer kept the complainant on the phone until after 5pm. Even though the correct codes had been entered, the bank decided to call the customer to check. The bank staff member wasn't able to get through to the complainant's phone because the scammer kept her on the line. By the time the bank got through, it was too late.

• The viral story of a woman who raised $400,000 on GoFundMe for a homeless veteran who gave her his last $20 was all a scam, prosecutors say.
• Johnny Bobbitt, Kate McClure, and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico were all arrested in connection with the alleged plot.
• Burlington County prosecutors say she texted a friend less than an hour after the GoFundMe story was posted suggesting it was fake.
• "Okay so wait the gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad," she said in one text message.
• GoFundMe says it's refunding everyone who donated to the campaign.

The feel-good story about a couple who raised $400,000 for a homeless veteran seems to have fallen apart, as New Jersey prosecutors charged the trio with an elaborate plot to make up a viral story and steal the money they raised from it.

"The paying-it-forward story that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true," New Jersey's Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said at a press conference Thursday. "Unfortunately, it was. The entire campaign was predicated on a lie."

The story first went viral in November of 2017. According to the story posted on GoFundMe, Johnny Bobbitt, a homeless United States marine veteran, gave his last $20 to Kate McClure for gas after her car broke down near a Philadelphia overpass he lived under. McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, helped Bobbitt get back on his feet. They posted the story on GoFundMe and ultimately raised $400,000 for him.

But new developments emerged in August, when Bobbitt sued the couple, claiming they withheld the money from him and that they used it for their own vacations and luxury goods. It led to a series of court hearings, a police raid, and an investigation that ultimately lead authorities to conclude that they had fabricated the story.

Bobbitt, D'Amico, and McClure were all taken into police custody and charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception this week. And Coffina said authorities may have never even found out about the alleged scheme if the couple didn't fight with Bobbitt over the money in the first place.

The evidence Coffina's office reviewed partially hinges on 67,000 text messages from McClure's phone. Less than an hour after the GoFundMe page was posted, McClure told a friend that part of the story was made up, according to prosecutors.

"Okay so wait the gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad," she said in one text message.

Prosecutors also said that Bobbitt posted a similar story on Facebook in 2012, where he said he gave the last of his money to a woman whose car broke down in a Walmart parking lot in North Carolina. They speculated it may have partially inspired the plot.

"I don't think that's a coincidence," Coffina said.

GoFundMe previously intervened when Bobbitt sued the couple for withholding the $400,000 raised for him. It gave Bobbitt $20,000, and said it may give him the rest of the money pending an investigation.

Now, GoFundMe has pledged to refund the money to everyone who donated to the campaign.

"All donors who contributed to this GoFundMe campaign will receive a full refund. GoFundMe always fully protects donors, which is why we have a comprehensive refund policy in place," the company said in a statement to People. "GoFundMe will process all refunds in the coming days. While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. ... We are fully cooperating and assisting law enforcement officials to recover every dollar withdrawn by Ms. McClure and Mr. D'Amico."

OTTAWA COUNTY — With the biggest shopping weekend of the year around the corner, holiday deal-seekers are out in droves. While store employees work to keep electronics, decorations and gift cards stocked on the shelves, opportunist scammers are also working hard this holiday season.

According to a report from ADT Security Services, more than 1,800 Michigan residents were victims of scams in 2017. Elderly residents are at particular risk, accounting for 57 percent of fraud victims, according to AARP.

Online, in-person and charity scams ramp up around Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the Christmas season, preying on gift-givers. Because scammers are notoriously difficult to catch, area police and business associations are warning people to be extra cautious and protect themselves against fraud.

“A lot of scams are difficult to investigate and prosecute,” said Holland Police Department Capt. Keith Mulder. “Unless you have a suspect, there’s generally very little we can do. Scammers are hard to track down, so if it doesn’t sound right, don’t give info out. Be more cautious before anything happens.”

According to TechCrunch, the fourth quarter is always busiest for e-commerce businesses, with the biggest sales and thousands of consumers turning to the internet for their holiday shopping.

Unfortunately, legitimate businesses can be overshadowed by pop-up websites designed to steal credit card information from shoppers.

“There are literally thousands of fake websites put up over the holidays,” said Phil Catlett, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of West Michigan. “Many of us are online looking for gifts and we’d like to find the best deal we can. Sometimes, you’ll find brand-name merchandise that’s priced so much lower than everywhere else, but that’s because it probably isn’t real.”

These websites, according to Catlett, are often designed to take your money and run.

“You should always check how long the website has been operating,” he said. “Do a general search to see what others are saying about it. If it’s real, you’ll have months or years of successful operations and people responding appropriately. If there’s nothing, or you see negative responses, you know to run in the other direction.”

Online, it can be difficult to tell if a website or advertisement will lead to a scam, especially for people that aren’t avid internet shoppers. Eye-catching ads on Facebook and other social media sites can lead consumers astray to the fake sites Catlett warns about.

“If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” Mulder said. “Especially if it’s not a reputable company and you’ve never heard of it. They can look pretty good up front, but they’re not legitimate.”

The Michigan State Police recommends online shoppers only buy from websites people know and trust, with a secure “https” URL rather than just “http.” Once you buy something online, keep a close eye on bank statements to make sure nothing is amiss.

If you do feel like you’ve been the victim of a fake online retail scheme, call your bank and cancel the affected credit card, then file a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov. Some banks will require you to make a police report with your local police department, which you can do by calling the department’s non-emergency phone number.

Personal ads on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist can also lead to scams. People will agree to buy an item they see online, then the seller never shows up or the item is broken. Because these arrangements are just verbal agreements and not signed contracts, Mulder said it’s technically not a prosecutable crime for a seller to not follow through on their end of the deal.

If you do choose to buy something from Craigslist or a similar site, make sure to meet in a public place for your own safety. In Holland, the lobby between the court and the police department at 89 W. Eighth St. is always open and chances are, if the seller isn’t willing to meet at the police department, they’re up to something.

Before you give the seller their money, test the item out to make sure it works, especially electronics.

In addition to being cautious on Facebook Marketplace, social media users should be wary of scams in disguise. Shoppers can be scammed — albeit unintentionally — by their Facebook friends.

Since 2015, the “Secret Sister Gift Exchange” has circulated on Facebook during the holiday season.

The post typically reads, “I am looking for six or more ladies interested in a holiday gift exchange. Doesn’t matter where you live — you are welcome to join. You have to buy one gift valued at least $10 and send it to your secret sis. You will then receive six to 36 gifts in return.”

The exchange between strangers may sound harmless. However, according to the BBB, it’s a scam that can land participants in legal trouble.

“This is a typical chain letter scam that, sooner or later, has to fall apart,” said Catlett. “Our guidance to consumers is to avoid ever participating in anything like this. When you do, you’re bringing others in and you’re part of the crime. It might be totally innocent, but you have to think about the consequences of your actions.”

A website browser isn’t the only thing that can get shoppers in trouble. Email users should be watchful of a popular shipping confirmation scam that recurs each holiday season.

In this scam, consumers receive an email from someone claiming to be from the U.S. Postal Service or another major shipping company like FedEx or UPS. They are told a package is waiting for them, or that someone else has received a package intended for them.

Then, consumers are either invited to click a link or asked to provide personal information, including their name, address and date of birth.

“If you click the link, you could open yourself up to malware and spyware,” said Catlett. “It could be any number of illegitimate things. Instead of clicking the link or providing your information, contact the organization directly and ask. By doing that, you circumvent using the questionable email.”

According to the U.S. Postal Service, package recipients will never be asked to provide secure information via phone or email. Instead, a carrier will attempt to visit the location in person.

Scammers aren’t limited to online, though. If you are shopping in a physical store, make sure to keep purchases in your trunk or under a blanket so people can’t see what’s in your vehicle. If you carry a purse, clipping a carabiner through the purse handle and part of your shopping cart will prevent bag theft.

Additionally, make sure to park in a well-lit area and lock your vehicle at all times. And, if you plan to purchase gift cards, be sure to buy them in-store and ensure the numbers on the back haven’t been exposed.

Thanksgiving and Christmas also start the “giving season,” where charities collect a large percentage of their annual donations. Fake charities, though, can turn a well-intentioned action into a disappointing headache for donors.

According to the ADT report, U.S. residents lost $1.4 million to charity scams in 2017 alone, and scammers are getting smarter every year.

“Scammers are going to go where their victims already are,” said Catlett. “They’re putting out fake charities or buying website addresses that are one letter different than the real website. You might think you’re giving to a particular nonprofit but, in reality, your money is going somewhere else. As a consumer, you should always check to make sure the website address is correct.”

If you’re unsure whether a charity is trustworthy, look the charity up on charitywatch.org, which rates charities based on their financial disclosures and reputations. If you get an email from a charity organization, make sure there’s a logo from that charity in the email and that the monetary donation is going to the same physical address listed for that charity on its website.

In general, following red flags on websites and being aware of personal safety in stores will go a long way to prevent holiday shopping fraud.

“If they’re asking for personal information, don’t give it out,” Mulder said. “If everybody abided by that rule, there’d be way less successful scams.”

On Nov. 8 at 7:34 a.m., Officer James Brady was dispatched to a crash on Chief Justice Cushing Highway (Route 3A) involving two vehicles. When the officer arrived he observed what appeared to be a rear end collision involving a 2015 Volkswagen Jetta and 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Officer David Orlandi arrived to assist and officers spoke with both drivers about the accident. Both drivers were traveling northbound on Route 3A, when the Jeep stopped due to traffic and was rear ended by the Jetta. Neither driver was injured in the crash, but as Officer Brady spoke to the driver of the Jetta, he appeared to be drowsy and confused. He told the officer he was on his way to a doctor’s appointment. When he was asked if he had taken any alcohol or drugs prior to the accident, the driver said he had not had alcohol but had taken prescription medication approximately an hour before.

The driver declined medical treatment and when Officer Brady asked him to do some field sobriety tests he refused. Based on his observations, Officer Brady, who is drug recognition expert (DRE) formed an opinion that the driver was impaired and operating under the influence of drugs and placed him under arrest. The vehicle was towed and the driver – Adrian H. Dunne, 24, of 355 Washington St. in Brighton – was taken to the police station and charged with OUI drugs - second offense, operating to endanger - second charge, and failure to use care slowing/stopping. Hingham Police made a request to the registry of motor vehicles for an immediate suspension of Dunne’s driver’s license.

On Nov. 6 at 7:40 p.m., Officer Christopher LoBianco was monitoring traffic on Hobart Street when he saw a vehicle travel by him at a high rate of speed. He used radar to verify the vehicle’s speed was 57 mph in a 40 mph zone.

Officer LoBianco pulled the vehicle over on Cross Street and explained to the driver he had stopped her for speeding. A check of the driver’s information showed she had an outstanding warrant. Officer Jeffrey Kilroy arrived to assist and the driver – Katlyn Marie Salerno, 21, of 59 Cross St. in Hingham, was placed under arrest.

A check of the vehicle – a 2018 Lexus SE - showed it did not have a current inspection sticker. The car was towed and Salerno was transported to the police station. The warrant out of Quincy District Court through the Weymouth Police was domestic assault and battery. Hingham Police also cited Salerno for speeding and failure to have a current inspection sticker.

On Nov. 7 at 9:55 p.m., Officer Bryan LoBianco was travelling on Rockland Street when he saw a 2015 Honda Civic drive by him with its drivers’ side headlight out. Officer LoBianco pulled the vehicle over on Bonnie Brier Circle and explained to the driver that he had stopped him for defective equipment.

The passenger in the front seat told police he was the owner of the car and a check of his information showed he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Hingham Police Det. John Marquardt was nearby the scene and stopped to assist. The front seat passenger, who had a backpack between his legs, stepped out of the car and was placed under arrest.

K-9 officer Robert Achille then arrived to assist. As the owner of the car was being placed under arrest, Officer Achille was speaking to driver and detected strong odor of marijuana coming from vehicle. He could also see the backpack in the front seat was open and contained a large, heat sealed plastic bag containing what appeared to be several ounces of marijuana. That backpack was removed from the car and inside officers found more than 12 ounces of marijuana, a box of snack size plastic baggies, a digital scale, three additional heat sealed plastic bags as well as documents with the name of the passenger that was arrested. Police also seized a cell phone and $337 cash.

The driver was given a verbal warning for the headlight and he and the other passengers continued on their way. The owner of the car, Matthew F. Connell, 22, of 70 Partridge Hill Road in Braintree, was transported to the police station and was charged with possession of a Class D substance with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana more than two ounces outside his residence and having an open container of marijuana in the vehicle. The default warrant out of Quincy District Court was for a probation violation.

On Nov. 11 at 7:02 p.m., Officer Michaal Gervasi was parked at the rotary on Summer Street monitoring traffic when he saw a vehicle travel by him with heavily tinted windows. A check on the vehicle’s registration showed the owner had a suspended driver’s license. Officer Gervasi pulled the vehicle over on Broad Cove Road and spoke to the driver who he recognized was also the owner.

Officer Jeremiah Sullivan arrived to assist and the driver was placed under arrest. Before it was towed, officers conducted an inventory of the vehicle -- a 1995 Toyota Avalon – and found four packaged vials of THC extract oil in the center console. Also in console, was an additional vial containing THC oil, which is extracted from marijuana and according to the packaging, contains 91 percent THC.

Police seized the vials as evidence, the Toyota was towed and the driver – Matthew M. McQuade, 23, of 25 Riverbank Road in Quincy, was charged with driving with a suspended license and possession of a Class D substance, marijuana.

On Nov. 13 at 11:59 a.m., Officer Christopher LoBianco was traveling westbound on Lincoln Street (Route 3A) when he saw a vehicle traveling in same direction with no headlights on in the heavy rain. A check of registration showed it had been revoked due to insurance being canceled.

Officer LoBianco pulled the vehicle over in the Hingham Shipyard. Sgt. Corey Farina arrive d to assist and a check of the driver’s information showed he had an outstanding warrant and he was placed under arrest.

The vehicle, a 2009 Volkswagen Jetta was towed and the driver, Gabriel P. Saint-Fleur, 23, of 74 Truman Drive in Randolph, was charged with driving without insurance, and driving with a revoked registration. The default warrant out of Quincy District Court through the Randolph Police had three charges, uninsured vehicle, unregistered vehicle and suspended registration.

On Nov. 10 at 7:12 p.m., Officer Scott Miller was dispatched to an 88 year-old resident’s home for a report she’d been the victim of a phone scam. The woman said she received a call the day before from a person claiming to be a friend, who had been arrested.

The alleged friend then put another man on the phone to speak with the woman. That man claimed to be a public defender from New York, who said for her friend’s case to be resolved, she needed to send $8,000 to an address in New York.

The man instructed her specifically to place the cash in five legal sized envelopes, each one containing $1,600 in one hundred dollar bills. The man further instructed the woman to wrap the envelopes in newspaper and ship them overnight to the New York address. The woman then went to her bank and withdrew the $8,000, then went to a shipping store in Weymouth to send the money overnight. The next day (Nov. 10), the woman said she received another call from the man who told her the case had become more complicated and she would need to send an additional $8,000. Suspecting she had been scammed, the woman refused, hung up and called police.

According to Sgt. Steven Dearth, this latest ruse is a variation of the grandparent scam involving the arrest of a friend or family member, and he reminds residents to be wary of anyone asking for money or personal information over the phone.

“We recommend you never send cash or credit card information from a phone call you receive,” Dearth said. “Make some calls to family and verify facts before you withdraw or send money.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Friday unveiled bipartisan legislation to toughen penalties on robocalls, make it easier for regulators to crack down on unwanted calls and compel mobile phone providers to adopt call authentication technologies.

Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, introduced legislation that would also bring federal agencies and state attorneys general together to “address impediments to criminal prosecution of robocallers.” The bill is also backed by the incoming chair of the committee, Republican Senator Roger Wicker.

The bill would broaden the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to impose penalties of up to $10,000 per call that intentionally flout telemarketing restrictions.

YouMail, a company that blocks robocalls and tracks them, estimated there were 5.1 billion unwanted U.S. calls last month, up from 3.4 billon in April.

U.S. regulators have taken a number of actions to try to deter robocalls or automated, prerecorded calls that regulators have labeled a “scourge.”

“Existing civil penalty rules were designed to impose penalties on lawful telemarketers who make mistakes. This enforcement regime is totally inadequate for scam artists and we need to do more to separate enforcement of carelessness and other mistakes from more sinister actors,” Thune said.

The bill would require carriers to adopt technology to verify that incoming calls are legitimate before they reach consumers’ phones and require new rules to help protect subscribers from receiving unwanted calls or texts from callers using unauthenticated numbers.

The bill also would extend the statute of limitations to three years up from one year for the FCC to impose robocall fines and direct federal agencies and state attorneys general to work together on prosecuting robocallers.

Three consumer groups praised the bill on Friday. Consumer Reports said “spoofed robocalls have become a major intrusion into consumers’ everyday lives, and an all-too-convenient vehicle for scammers.”

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Friday said on Twitter he is pleased that the bill “would make it easier for the @FCC to go after illegal #robocall scams by extending the statute of limitations for enforcement actions.”

Pai earlier this month wrote the chief executives of major telephone service providers and other companies, demanding they launch a system no later than 2019 to combat billions of robocalls and other nuisance calls received monthly by American consumers.

The letters went to 13 companies including AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, T-Mobile US Inc, Alphabet Inc, Comcast Corp, Cox Communications Inc [COXC.UL] and Sprint Corp.

Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons said this week that two-thirds of consumer complaints made to the agency are about unwanted calls. The FTC has begun publishing caller ID numbers of robocallers in consumer complaints so apps and telecommunications companies can use the data to block unwanted calls. Simons also urged Congress to give the FTC jurisdiction to investigate telecommunications companies as warranted.

Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Markey, a member of the committee, introduced the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act Friday, which would allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to levy civil penalties of up to $10,000 per call.

“The TRACED Act targets robocall scams and other intentional violations of telemarketing laws so that when authorities do catch violators, they can be held accountable,” Thune said in a press release. “Existing civil penalty rules were designed to impose penalties on lawful telemarketers who make mistakes. This enforcement regime is totally inadequate for scam artists and we need do more to separate enforcement of carelessness and other mistakes from more sinister actors.”

“As the scourge of spoofed calls and robocalls reaches epidemic levels, the bipartisan TRACED Act will provide every person with a phone much needed relief,” Markey added. “It’s a simple formula: call authentication, blocking, and enforcement, and this bill achieves all three. I thank Chairman Thune for his partnership on this effort, and look forward to seeing this legislation through to its passage.”

Besides imposing fines, the bill would direct the FCC to help protect subscribers from receiving unwanted calls or texts, extend the window for FCC enforcement to three years after the robocall is placed, bring together several agencies and offices to report to Congress how to improve illegal robocall prevention, require providers of voice services to adopt call authentication technologies.

The website YouMail, which monitors robocalls and provides a blocking service estimates that 5.1 billion robocalls were made in October alone, amounting to two per second. However, it is unclear how many of those were illegal.

Over the past two weeks, Indian police have been bursting into suspected illegal call centres, arresting everyone in sight and seizing troves of equipment used to carry out phone fraud aimed at foreigners. Hundreds of Canadians are among the victims of the so-called "CRA scam," and their combined losses — from just two of the raided offices — are likely to be at least in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

"This is just the beginning, says Chief Ajay Pal Sharma of the Noida Station. "More illegal call centres are running in the city, which will be busted soon. We will be conducting more raids."

Police say they arrested 28 people in just one of their sweeps, including two seen as the kingpins of the operation. Most are in their twenties.

They are expected to face fraud-related charges, which could result in jail time.

The raids were triggered by a visit from Canadian police to Noida, a suburb of India's capital New Delhi, following a CBC Marketplace investigation that revealed how and where many of the scammers were operating. An RCMP officer based in India, in cooperation with the FBI, approached Indian authorities to act.

It's part of a message the Mounties are trying to send in India.

"We're going to work jointly, collaboratively to take you down," says Supt. Peter Payne, the federal force's top cop on financial crime.

Dozens of scam centres are believed to still be active in multiple cities across India, each with independent managers and using their own technology to evade detection.

Indian security observers also believe at least some of the centres are operating with police approval, in a country where bribery is not an unusual way to circumvent investigative scrutiny.

In just one of the raided facilities, investigators located a spreadsheet containing details on more than 600 Canadian victims of the scheme. RCMP officers in Canada will now begin the task of contacting every one of them to determine how much was stolen from them, and whether there is any prospect of getting the money back.

"We're going to try our best efforts to do it," Payne told CBC News, "but I can't make any guarantees."

Indian police have also paraded those arrested in front of news cameras. They say it's being done in part to show action against an industry that rarely faces prosecution, and also to send a message to the many centres that continue to operate.

The CRA scam, just one of the criminal schemes operated from the centres, typically begins with a robocall claiming to be from the CRA and telling the recipient that they owe taxes. The target is informed that they must call back — or face arrest and imprisonment. Call spoofing technology is used to make it appear the number is in Canada, and sometimes even originating from a legitimate CRA contact centre. Those who call back are subjected to further threats, but then offered a one-time chance to pay and settle the matter. Thousands of Canadians have done exactly that over the past several years, at an estimated cost of more than $10 million, falling prey to the dozens of call centres using the same scheme. Watch the Marketplace team track down the call centres in India: The victims are often the most vulnerable — the elderly or immigrants to Canada. CBC News spoke to a number of them, many of whom reported feeling deeply embarrassed. Most do not want to be identified, for fear of being targeted again. Gehangir Rashidi, who lost more than $100,000 to scammers, says he welcomes the latest raids and arrests. "This is excellent, it makes me happy. Keep going. Find all of them … I'd like my money back." That may prove to be challenging. Victims are asked to hand over money in a variety of ways, including through bitcoin ATMs and gift cards, including those offered by credit card companies and Apple. Further complicating things, offshore financial intermediaries often process the money to insulate the scammers from scrutiny, generally pocketing about 40 per cent of the total amount, according to Indian police. Though the scam itself has existed in India for close to a decade, these sorts of police raids are exceedingly rare. The October arrests mark the first in two years. Many Canadian victims of the scams told CBC News earlier this year that they felt their complaints were being ignored. Some reported their cases to local police forces, but were told the crime originated overseas and so nothing could be done by Canadian authorities. Others contacted the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, run jointly by the RCMP and other agencies, but many said those complaints were never responded to. The bulk of the call centres operate in Mumbai, India's largest metropolis. In July, senior Indian police officials there told CBC News they'd never received a request for assistance from the RCMP to intervene against the scam. The RCMP say they are most certainly in contact now, and expect to continue the co-operation with Indian law enforcement. They also say information is being shared through the secretive Five Eyes inter-government intelligence and surveillance network. Canada's federal force acknowledges that investigative reports done by CBC News put a spotlight on the issue and contributed to the action being taken. "It drew more public awareness onto law enforcement and the Government of Canada to do something," Payne says. "We're serious about combating this issue, and public awareness is the only way to do it." While the RCMP has scored some limited success with the latest raids, the federal force is emphasizing prevention over prosecution. In other words, they want Canadians to know what the scam sounds like so they can avoid becoming a victim. "It's more of an education awareness thing," Payne says. "These scammers are not going to stop." Watch David Common's story on the CRA-scam raids in India from The National:

"If you are reading this, you are part of the illusion."

Over the weekend, an elaborate web of lies spun by a little-known metal act named Threatin unspooled in front of the internet. And today, it’s spiralled out of control.

For those not in the know, here’s a quick run-down. Composed of one permanent member, Jered Threatin, this LA-based ‘band’ has just kicked off their first European tour, booking a bucketload of stops across the continent. This is despite having no actual fanbase, meaning that three people came to the tour’s opening concert in London.

The venue was understandably pissed, given that Threatin said they’d pre-sold 291 tickets. So how does one unknown name convince a spate of overseas venues to hold his shows? And why?

As reported by Metal Sucks, Threatin pretended to be his band’s promoter to book the gigs after elaborately inflating his clout, faking a record deal, awards and fans through fabricated concert footage across YouTube and fake social media followers.

While the latter isn’t that odd, unfortunately, the former is super elaborate: if you search the band on YouTube, you’ll find a spate of ‘fan-uploaded’ footage of high-octane Threatin gigs.

But they seem to be spliced together — the band never appears in the same shot as the crowd, and it sounds like the audio of the band and rapturous audience have been dubbed into corresponding shots. According to the captions, that’s because it was super hectic, obviously.

As this below says, “I could only get a few seconds here and there the crowd was pretty wild. i kept almost dropping my phone…great show though.”

Threatin also seems to have deleted fake interviews with himself, where the ‘journalist’ is off-camera.

This is all very funny, except for the fact that it leaves venues across Europe out-of-pocket: two more English venues put Threatin on blast after equally empty gigs, before the tour was officially cancelled.

Now, Jered Threatin has made a statement explaining that he’s actually a brain genius for engineering the whole scam. You see, this has been social commentary all along! Or something.

“What is fake news?,” he writes on Twitter. “I turned an empty room into an international headline. If you are reading this, you are part of the illusion.”

He also added a lot of hashtags, including #Marketing, #Psychology, #SocialMedia, #FakeNews and #BreakingTheWorld.

We could explain that fake news isn’t actually people reporting on a very real scam, but we have a feeling Threatin isn’t one for logic or reason. Then again, we are giving him attention, which is clearly what he wants: really makes you think, doesn’t it?

The United States District Court is warning of a new jury duty scam.

The scammers are calling people, saying they didn't show up to jury duty and threatening to arrest people if they don't pay a fine immediately.

Officials say official court phone numbers are being used, as well as the names of actual judges.

A Chinese scientist who worked at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was found guilty Thursday of laundering more than $300,000 as part of a worldwide scam that duped victims into buying gifts cards to pay off fake debts.

Fan Xia, 31, researched nanotechnology at UWM on a visitor exchange program, known as a J-1 visa, but now faces a possible jail term, deportation or both.

He was charged in August 2017 with being a bit player in a multilayered international fraud unraveled after an Illinois victim of a popular IRS scam quickly contacted police there.

After a three day trial, the jury returned its verdicts late Thursday morning. Fan, who remains free on bail, was convicted of one felony theft, one misdemeanor theft and two misdemeanor counts of receiving stolen property. His sentencing is set for Dec. 5.

Witnesses included IRS scam victims from Illinois and New York and various law enforcement officials, including those who did the forensic analysis of Fan's computer and phone. Fan presented no evidence in his defense.

"Usually we get involved in these cases when a local victim calls us," said Wauwatosa Police Detective John Milotzky, the lead investigator. "This time, the suspect was here and we learned from him what happened to the cards."

Criminals claiming to be with the IRS call people and tell them they owe back taxes or penalties but can pay them with Target gift cards. Victims then buy the cards and report the numbers back to the callers.

According to the criminal complaint against Fan, he was seen using the Illinois victim's numbers at stores in the Milwaukee area to buy iTunes cards. Police then tracked him as he visited Target, Best Buy and Walmart stores 23 times over eight days. He was arrested in July 2017 as he drove to another Target store.

Fan told police he got the card numbers from people in India who he said told him they were legal. Because they always worked, Fan assumed they were. He denied any knowledge of the IRS scam.

Once he got iTunes cards, he said, he'd scratch the covering off the activation codes, take photos of the cards, and send the photos to China and get paid. The Chinese recipients then sell the iTunes or Google Play cards one last time to end users.

Messages police found on Fan's phone suggested he was buying up to $3,000 of new cards a day with the Indian numbers and that some numbers he tried to use had been reported stolen and blocked. At his Shorewood apartment, police found more than 200 scratched off gift cards worth about $10,000.

Milotzky said the case taught investigators just how deeply layered and widespread gift card frauds can be. He said the callers in India appeared to be pushing the scammed gift card numbers out to runners like Fan all over the country; in fact, some of the same numbers Fan was using were found to be in use in Florida.

The rings are sophisticated, he noted, illustrated by the fact that the callers in India, runners in the U.S. and the final sellers in China all were getting their cuts of the profits.

Investigators were skeptical that someone as smart as Fan didn't know what was really going on.

Fan has an undergraduate degree from a Chinese university and earned a doctorate from Hanyang University in South Korea in 2016, according to announcements from UWM about him joining the Energy Storage research group led by professor Junjie Niu, of the College of Engineering & Applied Science in 2016.

Acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker received early warnings that customers were complaining that an invention-marketing company he advised might be a fraud, according to several people familiar with his role, but Whitaker vigorously defended the company and remained on its board until joining the Justice Department in 2017.

Since his appointment by President Trump last week, Whitaker has said through a Justice Department spokeswoman that he was unaware of allegedly fraudulent activities at Miami-based World Patent Marketing. The company shut down in May and agreed to pay a settlement of nearly $26 million to resolve a wide-ranging Federal Trade Commission complaint that it bilked customers.

As a member of the company’s advisory board, Whitaker had been told of complaints about the company’s practices, according to two people familiar with the FTC investigation. He did not appear to take any action in response, they said.

In addition, shortly after joining the board in late 2014, Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, personally intervened when a for-profit consumer complaint website posted comments critical of the company.

Ed Magedson, the founder of the Arizona-based Ripoff Report, said he received a phone call from Whitaker in early 2015 after the website posted complaints about World Patent Marketing.

“He threatened me, using foul language,” said Magedson, whose website sells companies a program to improve their reputation among consumers. “He threatened to sue and to ruin my business if I did not remove the ‘false reports.’ ”

At one point, Whitaker said he would refer Ripoff Report to the Department of Homeland Security, Magedson said.

Justice Department officials have said Whitaker served in a limited capacity as an outside legal adviser to World Patent Marketing and was not involved in the company’s day-to-day operations.

Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the department, declined to comment on Whitaker’s interactions with Magedson.

“Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker has said he was not aware of any fraudulent activity. Any stories suggesting otherwise are false,” Kupec said.

[Before he led the Justice Department, Matthew G. Whitaker promoted company accused of deceiving clients]

Whitaker joined the board of World Patent Marketing in October 2014 after a failed U.S. Senate run, eventually collecting about $10,000 in fees, according to court documents. “As a former U.S. Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization,” Whitaker said in a company news release at the time.

Complaints about the company, which was founded by Miami businessman Scott J. Cooper, had already begun surfacing.

In a September 2014 posting on the Ripoff Report, one person wrote that World Patent Marketing had offered to help market that person’s idea for a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, according to an archived version of the site.

Another complaint posted in January 2015 came from a person who claimed to have worked as an employee at the company.

“Let me explain [to] you exactly how this scam works,” the person wrote, describing in detail the tactics the company used to reel in consumers.

The person said the company would accept any invention idea, no matter how improbable, building excitement in customers by promising that their proposals were being analyzed by a review team. “The whole step by step process was simply created to get you excited about your idea,” the person wrote.

Magedson said he received the phone call from Whitaker around that time.

Magedson said it is not uncommon for Ripoff Report to receive complaints from businesses when they are reviewed negatively on the site. Ripoff Report’s business model — which encourages companies to pay for a program that can yield better reviews — has been criticized. A federal judge in Utah found in 2015 that the website encouraged negative reviews and that it accepted online postings from competitors of businesses reviewed on the site as well as from consumers. The finding came in a defamation suit in which Ripoff Report ultimately prevailed.

Magedson said that Whitaker’s complaints were particularly memorable.

“He did not threaten me physically, but said he would shut us down and threatened to refer us to a federal agency, Homeland Security,” he said. “He was yelling.”

After their conversation, Magedson posted a note on Ripoff Report noting that Whitaker, whom he described as a former U.S. attorney and GOP Senate candidate, had touted World Patent Marketing as “the top patent, idea protection and inventor services company for helping inventors and entrepreneurs succeed,” according to an archived page of the website. The posting did not describe Whitaker’s alleged threats.

That year, World Patent Marketing joined Ripoff Report’s Corporate Advocacy program, a way for companies to improve their reputations by submitting to a review by Ripoff Report.

Separately, FTC investigators found that Whitaker received complaints about the company in his role as an advisory board member, two people familiar with the probe said.

In one incident, a customer asked Whitaker to take action because World Patent Marketing was allegedly cheating customers out of their money. Whitaker forwarded the complaint to Cooper, the chief executive, according to the people.

FTC investigators did not find evidence that Whitaker sought to learn more about the allegations or expressed concerns about the accusations, the people said.

FTC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The FTC considered Whitaker a material witness when the agency began probing rampant customer complaints about World Patent Marketing. Investigators were examining whether Whitaker played a role in helping the company silence critics by threatening them with legal action, according to people with knowledge of the case.

But when the FTC subpoenaed Whitaker for his records related to the company in October 2017, he failed to provide any information, telling investigators that he was busy at that time moving from Iowa to Washington for a new job, the people said.

At the time, Whitaker was preparing to assume his post as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

[Federal investigators scrutinized Whitaker’s role in patent company accused of fraud, according to people with knowledge of case]

The FTC did not further pursue Whitaker’s records because World Patent Marketing began negotiating a settlement with the agency, the people said.

In its investigation, the agency concluded that World Patent Marketing falsely promised clients that it would patent and market their ideas in exchange for hefty fees — and then pocketed the money, court records show.

“For the last three years, Defendants have operated an invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,” the FTC alleged in a recently unsealed court filing.

In 2017, people who said they were victimized were notified that the FBI had opened a criminal investigation of the company, although several of the people said they have not seen any recent interest from the bureau. The FBI has declined to comment.

Since Whitaker’s appointment as acting attorney general, people who say they were victimized by World Patent Marketing have been comparing notes about their experiences, said Crystal Carlson, an inventor from Arizona who said she lost $36,000 when the company failed to market her idea for a product to prevent parents from forgetting infants in cars.

Carlson, whose extensive research into the company’s practices helped spur the FTC investigation, maintains a Facebook group for victims. She said some people who lost money have been incensed at Whitaker’s appointment.

Others, like her, think that Whitaker was probably fooled by Cooper about the company’s practices.

“I think, in hindsight, he would probably kick himself in the butt just like every other victim of World Patent Marketing has,” she said. “When you realize you’ve been victimized in that way, you question yourself. How could you have been so stupid as to have fallen for something like this?”

Others are less forgiving.

Nancy Torres, 60, said she lost more than $30,000 when World Patent Marketing failed to bring to market her newly designed nursing pillow. Torres said she is now deeply in debt and struggles to make home payments and provide for three grandchildren who live with her in Allentown, Pa.

Torres, who generally opposes Trump, said she has been upset by Whitaker’s appointment, especially the fact that the new acting attorney general never returned the money he was paid by World Patent Marketing. “It’s appalling,” she said. “Shame on him.”

Mobile security developers have new challenges as Santa Clara law officers bust ‘SIM swapping’ phone fraud. Highly-skilled hackers have taken to snitching large caches of cryptocurrencies and other valuable assets from mobile phones using the latest technique of “SIM Swapping” report the advanced REACT Task Force working in Californian state investing mobile fraud. One recent victim lost as much as $100,000 after his mobile number was hijacked.

REACT Supervisor Samy Tarazi shared that the Santa Clara County Sheriff office was instituted to handle cybercrimes, given that California is a tech cradle. Lately, the focus of the organization is on SIM swapping crimes, the officer said, since the number of such incidents reported has consistently increased. The primary targets of such crimes are Californian businessmen either living in the region or running their businesses in this area.

Tarazi believes that these crimes are the handiwork of a handful of cybercriminals, “a few dozens at the most.”

The profile of such SIM swapping criminals is interesting as well. The average age is between 19-22 years, and their modus operandi is: “someone who buys a 99 cent SIM card off eBay, plugs it into a cheap burner phone, makes a call and steals millions of dollars. That’s pretty remarkable.” Value of such cryptocurrency robberies has sometimes exceeded $100,000, the law enforcement team shared. The victim, in this case, was Christian Ferri, and he was the founder President of BlockStar a local area cryptocurrency firm.

In early July 2018, criminals were successful in breaking through Ferri’s mobile service provider, T-Mobile database and deactivate the victim’s SIM card at the time when the latter was traveling across Europe. Next, a new SIM card was activated for the same number on a device held by the hacker. This allowed them to complete a critical process – reset the Gmail account password. Once they had access to the victim’s Google Drive, they succeeded in using the credentials stored to access different services used by Ferris including a crypto exchange.

Since their focus was only on stealing cryptocoins, they exploited only that data and did not misuse any of the other critical information to acquire other assets of the victim.

The officials point out that most of the targets of SIM swapping based crypto coins-robberies are typically crypto influencers and are vocal on multiple platforms encouraging the use and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The social media accounts of such personalities are highly coveted and are also called as “OG account” and have a resale value of thousands of dollars.

The criminals used the weak software layer at the mobile carriers’ end to complete these heists. In the case of T-Mobile, a website bug allowed hackers to view the personal account of a customer when they used a phone number of the target along with a simple internal tool used on T-Mobile’s platform (which they could access via open internet). The glitch-access allowed them to reach out to access the PIN used by the victim on their mobile phone.

Katy Speerstra spends her spare time now going door to door, trying to find her lost dog.

Hamilton, a two-year-old chihuahua-poodle mix, raced out of her front door in southeast Calgary on Halloween night, chasing after a rabbit. She hasn't seen her beloved pet since.

But she has heard from a handful of suspected scammers looking to cash in on her pain.

"It's very, very cruel. You're so distraught because you want your loved one back," Speerstra said. "And then it's just really disappointing that that's where society's kind of headed, where some people think it's OK to ... take advantage of people when they're suffering."

After her dog went missing, she posted online and distributed flyers, hoping someone had found him. She had no responses — until she changed the ad to offer a reward.

Then her phone started ringing with numbers either blocked, private or randomly generated to be anonymous.

"The story line was fairly similar. They would say that they had Hamilton," she said. "The first time that I received that call that they had Hamilton, I was just so excited, I sat down. I was shaking. I thought the whole worry was over."

Instead, one caller insisted she pay the reward first in cash. Another later texted her to say they had bought Hamilton for $450 and wanted the purchase price plus a reward, or they wouldn't return her dog. In total, she had five anonymous tips, though she can't confirm they were all from different people.

Members of the YYC Pet Recovery Facebook group agreed with her that the first request sounded suspicious. Speerstra also contacted the Calgary Police Service and was told it sounded fishy. She was encouraged not to send any money or meet anyone except in a public place, like at a police station.

The police couldn't say if they've had other similar reports but said they have fraud and extortion investigators who can take complaints. However, resources are primarily allocated to situations where money has been lost.

Speerstra hopes telling her story publicly will help prevent other cases in the future, especially considering they're hard to investigate as scammers often use blocked or fake numbers. She said she's also worried someone who does find a lost dog might resort to similar extortion tactics.

"It's your furbaby, so of course you're in a panic to get it back but you're at the mercy of these people and the amounts they're going to set," she said.

In the meantime, she continues to look for Hamilton, who still hasn't come home.

If anyone wants to keep an eye out for Hamilton, he is a brown and red chihuahua-poodle mix and was last seen on Bow Bottom Trail running toward Canyon Meadows Drive. Speerstra can be reached at 403-399-5283.

A couple has filmed the tense moment a cabbie tried to scam them out of over $400 by telling a blatant lie - and locking the doors of the taxi.

Tourists in Paris are warning others after a cabbie tried to scam them into paying almost five times the real cost of a taxi — and then got angry when they refused.

The couple, from Thailand, filmed an incident in which a taxi driver tried to charge them an eye-watering fee of €247 ($409) for a 45km ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the city centre.

Official Paris cabs charge a flat rate from the airport of €50 ($82) to anywhere on the Right Bank of Paris and €55 ($91) to anywhere on the Left Bank. It's based on rules introduced in 2016.

But in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube, the driver angrily insists his €247 fee is correct and argues with the couple after they challenge it.

He tells the couple taxi fees in Paris were "not fixed price. It's by (the) meter." The meter appears to be an app on the driver's phone.

The video shows the driver getting angry when the couple demand to see his licence. He also lunges towards the back seat to stop one of the tourists filming him with his phone.

At one point, the couple ask to be taken to a police station so they can sort out the matter.

"I'm not going to police. You pay me, you go to police. What is your problem?" the driver tells them.

After many tense minutes of arguing, the couple eventually agree to pay a compromise price of €200 ($311) so they can finally get out of the cab.

One of the tourists, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, told Le Parisien the driver had locked the doors.

"The doors were locked, and we had all our luggage in the trunk," he said, according to a translation by The Independent.

"He did not want to let us out, and kept driving while (supposedly) phoning his company to find a compromise."

"So, we decided to pay €200 to get out."

The driver said he belonged to Chauffeur Prive. It is a legitimate company but its website advertises a flat rate of €45 ($70), The Independent reported.

The couple has already left Paris, but police are understood to be investigating the incident.

They said they wanted their experience to be "a case study for other Thai people or travellers to be conscious while they are travelling."

The video has clocked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube.

Paris is the third most visited city in the world, with 17.44 million tourists visiting in 2017.

On its website, Paris Airport advises visitors to say no to people posed as taxi drivers who approach them outside the baggage claim area, as official drivers operate this way.

Visitors should go outside the terminal for the dedicated taxi area and look for an illuminated sign on the outside of the cab and a meter on the inside.

The airport also says visitors can pre-book taxis through the official site for peace of mind.

OTHER SCAMS TO WATCH FOR IN EUROPE

Ash Zaman, travel safety expert from Travel Insurance Direct, said there was a variety of common crimes targeting tourists in Europe this year.
• The "there's something on your shirt!" scam: A foul substance such as fake bird droppings or mustard is splashed on to your shirt, and while a "helpful stranger" cleans it off for you someone picks your pocket.
• The infamous "gold ring" scam: A passer-by stops you and says you've dropped something, and shows you a "gold" ring. It's either a distraction technique — and your pocket is picked — or they insist you pay them a reward for finding it.
• "There's something wrong with your car!" scam: As you're driving a car pulls alongside and the driver indicates there's something drastically wrong with the rear of your vehicle. You stop, and as you and the stranger go to inspect the problem an accomplice makes off with your wallet/purse from the front seat.
• Hotel rats of Paris: Gangs of thieves are disguising themselves as tourists and infiltrating hotels around Paris. Some of them are opportunistic and will hang out in the lobby waiting for luggage and personal belongings to be left unattended before swooping.

Others are a bit more sophisticated and will actually check into hotels popular with tourists and then break into other hotel rooms to steal valuables.
• Moped gangs of London: Groups of armed thieves are roaming the streets on mopeds and scooters mugging and assaulting unassuming pedestrians and motorists. This includes tourist who are seen as easy prey. These gangs have a propensity for violence and are usually armed with bats, axes, knifes and won't hesitate in using force to get their way.

If you've fallen victim to pickpockets, scams or other crimes on holiday, make sure you notify the police immediately and contact your travel insurer's emergency assistance team should you need any medical assistance.

French and Israeli media report that a group largely made up of Israelis scammed 3,000 French citizens out of approximately $20 million. Most of the stolen money is in Israel, but Israeli authorities are reportedly failing to cooperate with France in prosecuting the scammers and retrieving the money.

This is the latest of numerous examples of Israeli officials stonewalling international efforts against the perpetrators of massive financial swindles around the world, according to Israeli investigative journalists and others. These scams have brought estimated billions into the Israeli economy, propping up a regime widely condemned for human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing against indigenous Palestinians. Together, the stories paint a picture of a government that seems to be turning a blind eye to – and even protecting – scammers.

A Finance Magnates analysis reports that one of the swindles alone has brought in over a billion dollars and employs 5,000 people. And a new scam, described below, may help what is predicted to be “the next major driver of the Israeli economy.”

A former IRS expert on international crime notes that “fraudulent industries are often major economic drivers, and that can translate into political clout.”

Some Israeli journalists have been working to expose the situation in Israeli newspapers, publishing exposés like “As Israel turns blind eye to vast binary options fraud, French investigators step in” and “Are French Jewish criminals using Israel as a get-out-of-jail card?” (Short answer: yes.)

The victims of the recent scam against French citizens included churches and the owners of small businesses – delicatessens, car repair shops, hair salons, plumbers, etc. Some lost their life savings and describe being threatened and intimidated by the scammers.

The masterminds of the scam reportedly were Antoine Ilan Frau (aka Ilan Frau) and Michael Nedjar, both of whom resided in Israel at the time. French police arrested the two at the Paris airport in 2016 as they were about to return to Israel. While they and 25 others were subsequently found guilty in a French court, other alleged co-conspirators have not yet been arrested and are believed to be in Israel.

The Times of Israel (TOI) reports that most of the money was channeled to Israel and has not yet been recovered. The newspaper reports that Israeli law enforcement authorities “have been unhelpful in enabling further investigation of the scam and in recovering the stolen funds.”

TOI, which obtained the full French verdict statement, reports: “In 200 pages of matter-of-fact legal prose, the verdict paints a picture of Israeli authorities unwilling to cooperate with their French counterparts.”

Another article reports: “The exact number of French citizens thought to be evading authorities in Israel is unknown, but France has sent to Israel at least 70 formal requests for judicial assistance with cases involving suspected fraud by dual nationals residing in the Jewish state.”

Below are some of the other Israeli-connected scams victimizing people around the world that observers accuse the Israeli government of largely ignoring.

In 2016 Ha’aretz reported on an Israeli con artist named Gilbert Chikli, who boasts of pioneering a multi-million dollar scam that also targeted people in France. The New York Post has called him “the world’s greatest con artist.”

The scam, which targeted banks and businesses, cost French companies an estimated 7.9 million euros. Approximately 52 employees of the companies taken in by him were subsequently fired.

Despite French extradition requests, Ha’aretz reported in 2016 that Chikli “mysteriously remains a free man, living in luxury in his villa in a seaside Israeli city as French authorities try to bring him to justice over a massive con for which he was previously convicted.”

Although a French court sentenced Chikli to a seven-year prison sentence, Ha’aretz reported that instead of being incarcerated, Chikli was “hanging out at his private swimming pool.” Israeli officials refused to explain why Chikli was allowed to live freely in Israel.

Far from disputing the French conviction, Chikli bragged on Israeli TV about his technique: “You get off on it. Because you’re 5,000 kilometers from Paris with a telephone and a 100-euro calling card and you can make 10 million euros” [over $11 million].

Chikli boasted that he had a good life in Israel, where he dealt in real estate (in addition, it appears, to continuing his scams). He also made an estimated several thousand euros for “consultancy services” to a director who made a film based on Chikli’s story.

The film generated unprecedented attention in France, as it depicted “an Israeli-French underworld out of reach of French authorities,” in the words of TOI, “because of the complications in extraditing suspects from Israel.”

Chikli remained free in Israel from 2009 until he traveled to Ukraine in 2017, where he and another Israeli (also wanted by French authorities) were finally arrested, and Chikli was extradited to France. He was jailed and indicted for an additional scam perpetrated while he was at large.

A French report states that during his time in Ukrainian detention, Chikli was “filmed drinking vodka in his cell, toasting his wealth, swearing never to return to France, and abusing the French judicial system.” (See below)

Another international scam is Israel’s notorious binary options industry, which has brought in $10 billion a year. While the Israeli legislature made it illegal to sell the fraudulent options to Israelis, the Israeli legislature only belatedly (and partially) began to crack down on sales abroad. Millions of people around the world have been victimized by the scam, some committing suicide as a result.

An investigative report on the industry was aired on the French prime-time television magazine “Envoyé Spécial” in 2016: “La ruine à portée de clic” (“Financial ruin at the click of a mouse”). According to the report, tens of thousands of French citizens had been victimized by binary options and similar frauds.

The TV report calls Israel a “safe house” for fraudsters and shows undercover video of one of the Israeli call centers. Young French speakers — many of them new immigrants to Israel — are seen calling people in France and Europe, persuading them to “invest” in the scam. As they work to dupe people, the video shows employees dancing and laughing. When a bell rings announcing that they’ve succeeded and someone has given them money, they cheer.

Deborah Abitbol, a French-Israeli lawyer who acts on behalf of French forex and binary options victims, says that Israeli police “could raid these companies tomorrow if they wanted to… They could easily locate them and confiscate their computers.”

Abitbol points out: “These are the savings of people’s entire lives that are lost, gone with a click of a mouse. When you don’t have money left, the damage is irreparable.”

While Israeli law enforcement has sometimes gone after scammers, most often it seems to have left them alone.

A 2015 Israeli position paper by the Israel Securities Authority stated: “Our position is that a platform that solicits customers solely outside of Israel, and does not allow access to customers in Israel is not subject to the law, even if it is fully or partially run from Israel.”

Numerous people in Israel and abroad called for Israel to crack down on the call centers, but for years little was done. TOI reported that a senior Israeli police superintendent said that Israeli crime kingpins were behind the binary options industry and that “organized crime in the country had been massively enriched and strengthened.”

The scam caused ruin to people throughout the world, some committing suicide after their losses.

Finally, Israeli legislation against swindling people in other countries was finally proposed when the Israeli government became sufficiently worried that the scam was hurting Israel’s image abroad.

Notes on behalf of the proposed legislation warned that Israeli binary option companies risked damaging the country’s reputation and “could foment anti-Semitism.” The Israeli Knesset member who introduced the bill said: “We worry about the BDS movement. This industry has a huge impact on how Israel is viewed throughout the world.”

The Times of Israel reported that the legislation was catalyzed by an outcry “among overseas law enforcement agencies, with the FBI at the forefront, that Israel was allowing this ‘monstrous’ fraud to flourish year after year.”

Even that law, however, was watered down and seemed to leave the door wide open for continued swindles. Some charged that it would allow scammers to simply relocate and/or move into similar scams. The concern was merited.

A 2018 TOI article reports: “In the absence of effective law enforcement, Israel’s boiler room industries have proven resilient. Many have simply changed their product before or since the Knesset banned binary options and continued with business as usual.”

In June 2018 Israeli-operated boiler rooms in Asia and Eastern Europe were raided by local police. According to TOI, it was “one of the hundreds of Israeli-run boiler rooms operating worldwide in a global plague that, to the mounting dismay and incomprehension of international law enforcement bodies, is being left unchecked by Israeli law enforcement.”

TOI reports: “Israeli law enforcement has yet to indict a single operative from an industry that has stolen billions.”

In absence of Israeli action, FBI steps in

Finally, the FBI announced in September 2017 that the U.S. was going to start going after binary options scammers. FBI agents arrested an Israeli CEO when she landed at JFK airport. The woman, Lee Elbaz of Yukom Communications, currently awaits trial in the U.S. for operations that are believed to have victimized thousands of people.

The Israeli police refused to answer TOI‘s questions about where Israeli law enforcement had been during the years that these actions had been perpetrated.

A few months later the FBI pursued additional suspects in Israel. An Israeli lawyer who represents victims of binary options fraud said that the FBI raids were “a direct result of Israel’s failure to enforce the law.”

The attorney told TOI that he had been trying for years to alert Israeli law enforcement to financial frauds, with no result:

In January FBI agents raided at least one Israeli company and questioned the owner of some other Israeli companies that are accused of targeting Americans. No further arrests seem to have yet been made.

While the Bureau would not comment on the raids, a former senior FBI official told TOI that transnational organized crime networks are attracted to Israel because “they identify corruption and lax law enforcement.”

Some of the often inaccurately termed “Nigerian” scams have also been connected to Israel.

In 2010 seven Israelis were charged with scamming tens of millions of dollars from U.S. pensioners in a so-called “Nigerian scam,” according to Ha’aretz. Eventually, 12 Israelis were charged in the scheme to swindle elderly Americans.

The Israelis were extradited to the U.S., where the prosecutor described them as “a predatory group that targeted elderly people in the U.S., conning them into believing they were lottery winners. Preying on their victims’ dreams of financial comfort, [they] bilked them out of substantial portions of their life savings.”

According to the U.S. Attorney’s office:

The ringleaders, Avi Ayache and Yaron Bar, were eventually convicted, and the U.S. prosecutor announced that they would “spend a substantial portion of their lives in prison.” Ayache was sentenced in 2014 to 13 years in prison and Bar to 12. Yet, prison records indicate the two were released the next year. Other members of the ring also appear to have been released after extraordinarily little time.

If these men did serve only a tiny portion of their U.S. sentences, as public records and phone calls and emails to the Bureau of Prisons indicate, this may be due to the fact that Israelis are allowed to be imprisoned in Israel instead of in the U.S. Their sentences then are determined by Israel and, as we will see below, are often far shorter than they would be in the U.S.

In 2015 Gery Shalon and two other Israelis were charged with utilizing hacked data for 100 million people to spam them with “pump and dump” penny stocks, netting hundreds of millions of dollars.

The money was then laundered through an illegal bitcoin exchange allegedly owned by Shalon (more on bitcoin below). Shalon was considered the ringleader of what U.S. prosecutors called a “sprawling criminal enterprise.” He faced decades behind bars.

However, he was instead given a plea deal in which he escaped any prison sentence whatsoever. Worth $2 billion, Shalon was to pay a $403 million fine.

Israel has a history of shielding Israelis charged with crimes against Americans from U.S. penalties. Even when fraudsters are extradited to the U.S. and convicted of major crimes, they sometimes serve little time in prison.

In 2001 a Brooklyn businessman named Dov Engel fled to Israel in the face of criminal charges for a $115 million bank swindle that carried a potential sentence of 30 years in prison.

He was eventually extradited to the U.S., where Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Alonso called Engel’s scam “one of the most thoroughly corrupt operations I’ve seen as a white-collar crime prosecutor.”

A New York court convicted Engel of the charges, but he was not imprisoned in the U.S. because Israeli citizens were allowed to serve prison terms in Israel – under Israeli sentencing guidelines. This meant that Engel would only serve five years, at most, in prison; and Alonso predicted it would most likely be about two years. (Information doesn’t appear to be available about how much time Engel ended up serving in prison in Israel, if any.)

Engel was one of the first criminals to be extradited to the U.S. from Israel.

Before that time, Israel had often refused to extradite Americans who had fled to Israel to escape diverse criminal charges, including the dismemberment slaying of an American teen. Even in recent years, Israelis are often not extradited to the U.S. and other countries. In some cases, U.S. law enforcement officials don’t even bother to pursue this option.

Most recently, the Israeli who perpetrated 2,000 bomb threat hoaxes was tried in Israel instead of in the United States – even though most of his threats were against Americans, he held U.S. dual citizenship, and the FBI had been instrumental in finding him.

In the U.S. he would have potentially faced many decades in prison. While an Israeli court found the perpetrator, Michael Kadar, guilty in June 2018, there is no record that he has yet been sentenced. Kadar’s actions are reported to have earned him millions of shekels that he kept in a secret bitcoin account.

In January, not long after Israel’s legislation against binary options, TOI published an exposé entitled: “Diamonds are a scammer’s best friend: Undeterred by the new binary options ban, Israel’s boiler rooms are doing brisk business. An ex-employee describes how his company shifted to hawking diamonds.”

It turns out that Israeli scammers were now “selling diamonds online and over the phone with promises of a healthy profit, though the promised profits, and even the existence of the stones themselves, are often a matter of conjecture.”

The article reports that this had become “an Israeli cottage industry, mainly involving French speakers.” France’s financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), blacklists about 80 diamond-sales websites, and it is believed that many have links to Israel.

One former binary options employee said the company he worked for had simply removed the old logo and replaced it with one for a diamond investment: “The offices, staff, computers all stayed in place.”

Once again, Israeli law enforcement seems lax. The employee said that his manager told salespeople: “We are accustomed to the Israeli justice system, and we know how to proceed.”

As successful as the diamond racket was, there were quickly plans to branch out to an even more lucrative racket. People interviewing for jobs at the company were told that while the diamond scam would continue for awhile longer, it was on its way out. The company had begun selling a new product: bitcoin.

A June 2018 article reports that experts have been touting cryptocurrency and blockchain as “the next major driver of the Israeli economy.”

This would be a highly questionable driver. As TOI reports, “It is unclear how much of the activity in this new high-tech field is legitimate, how much is mere hype, and how much is outright fraud perpetrated by malevolent actors, including transnational criminal organizations.”

In December, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) published an article announcing: “Bitcoin Fraud Could Be the Next Big Thing for Swindlers in Israel.” The article, published in Israel’s Jerusalem Post, reported: “According to fraud experts, Israel is shaping up to be a hub for cryptocurrency swindling.”

“Fraudsters,” JTA said, “have begun to take advantage of a cryptocurrency bonanza with a variety of nefarious schemes.”

A former IRS special agent who focused on international fraud predicts that this will mushroom and that Israeli binary options swindlers will spearhead a “massive cryptocurrency fraud.”

An Israeli expert who helps victims of financial scams says: “More or less every binary options company we know of now has a cryptocurrency platform as well. I’m already getting calls from victims, but most people have yet to even realize they’ve been defrauded.”

An Israeli analyst on threat intelligence reports that “not a day goes by without our hearing about a new ICO [initial coin offering] scam or mining attack.” On November 8th, Ha’aretz reported: “Despite complaints to the authorities, users haven’t been warned about cybercriminals who swindle sellers of bitcoin using popular payment apps.”

According to Tel Aviv University Economics professor Neil Gandal, “It’s possible for a small number of actors to manipulate things,” TOI reports. Gandel says that Bitcoin’s first major price spike was likely caused by a single person, and a recent University of Texas paper found that Bitcoin’s more recent price spike was also caused by price manipulation.

TOI reports: “Thousands of Israeli binary options operatives have been looking for new work, and the cryptocurrency field, with its lack of regulation, potential for easy money and libertarian ethos, is a magnet for such individuals.”

According to , “Experts estimate that there are more than 100 fraudulent forex, CFDs, cryptocurrency, insurance, locksmith and Green Card lottery boiler rooms in the country.”

There have been massive demonstrations in Israel against corruption at high levels of government, and two police probes have targeted Prime Minister Netanyahu. A reformer warned of “a foul tsunami rising up in an ocean of corruption that threatens to drown the state of Israel. This is organized crime; crime families and Israeli mafia who are gaining control of local government and from there gradually taking over the central government and the nerve centers of Israeli society.”

In December, the Israeli legislature proposed regulation to ban companies trading in bitcoin from operating on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, suggesting that Israeli citizens will eventually be protected from the scam, as they were from binary options swindlers.

However, It is not known when or if Israel will take action against Israeli cryptocurrency scams that target people in other countries.

For now, events create an impression that the Israeli government is tolerating, and thus perhaps even tacitly encouraging, financial swindles that originate within its borders and devastate individual savings and lives around the world.

The fact that the U.S. government gives Israel over $10 million per day, and that this is about to go even higher, doesn’t seem to protect Americans from being targeted by Israeli financial rackets.

For how much longer?

Scammers have a new trick up their sleeves to extract financial details and personal information from people, but it’s not through better “phishing” email or sophisticated confidence games. Instead, it relies on something old fashioned: phone calls, sometimes from humans and sometimes automated.

The scam works like this: A victim receives a phone call that may be a live person, an automated message system, or a voice-response system programmed to act like it’s a live person. The Caller ID will show—either by phone number, name, or both—a financial institution or cellular operator at which the person has an account.

Next, the person or recording provides some details and tells the person they’re the victim of fraud and that they need to provide details—often including their account PIN—to set up a replacement card or freeze an account.

With that information in hand, the scammers can quickly manufacture ATM or debit cards, and make withdrawals or purchases. Or they can use online banking to transfer money or issue checks. Some scams simply collect information and then sell it to third parties.

Security writer Brian Krebs has documented a disturbing trend in attacks that rely on these phishers having obtained personal or private details from a victim. This may include part or all of a Social Security number, a credit card, and a home address.

Voice-based scamming isn’t new, and senior citizens lose tens of billions of dollars a year in the U.S. to fraud, a good portion by phone.

But the twist here is how much information these newer phishers have and the polish of the live people involved in the scam. These new attacks are so convincing that they took in two savvy Internet veterans who spoke to Krebs. One of them gave over all his info, while the other barely stopped short.

Part of what makes this attack so convincing is the phishers’ manipulation of Caller ID, which is an unverified system, making it entirely unreliable. With very little effort, a scammer can generate any phone number and text they want, in order to to appear as a reputable institution.

The trick to avoid voice-based scams is an old one: Never provide or confirm any private or financial details when you receive a call from a business. If asked, tell the caller you will call back.

Never use a phone number provided by a scammer, either. Always call the business back at a phone number provided on a card you have from it, or by visiting its web site.

Banks and credit-card companies will never ask for your PIN by phone, and if there’s a reason they need to call you, they verify themselves by providing information, but don’t ask you for anything beyond your name.

If you’re asked for personal details or account secrets, hang up. Some of these phishers may get aggressive, threatening the police, FBI, penalties, or a lawsuit. In that case, ask for a name and number—it’s always a scam, but it’s also likely the fraudster ends the call at that point or provides fake information.

Corey Hayward has never been in a car accident, but scammers called and preyed on his 82-year-old grandmother, convincing that he was facing criminal charges after causing a fatal car crash, and they needed her to pay to keep him out of jail.



Hayward said they had her use cash to buy gift cards at The Home Depot and Best Buy, then scratch the back of the cards and tell them the numbers over the phone.

"You wouldn't pay a lawyer with Best Buy gift cards, so I immediately knew something was wrong here," Hayward told WCVB.

Hayward said the scammers told his grandmother to shred the receipts, but she saved some showing she was in the stores, buying gift cards multiple times a week. "By her accounts - which, she has a list written down - she was up to $40,000, and I have $27,000 in receipts right here," Hayward said, showing WCVB the receipts she saved.

The scam artists went to great lengths to cover their tracks. They told Hayward's grandmother to keep it quiet.

"Every time she said, 'I need to talk to my grandson about this,' they said, 'no, no, no, you can't talk to him. He signed an non-disclosure agreement, you know, he'll get in trouble for that.'"

She eventually said something to him Friday night. That's when he went to police to try to recover the money.

Hayward is telling his story in the hopes of saving someone else from falling for a similar scam.

"They took her whole savings. She's broke. She has no money, and she's taking care of my grandfather who is very, very sick, and she was just the perfect target," he said.
###########################################################################################
He told her it was. "He's bleeding a lot," he added.

Then, the man told her that if she didn't send him money immediately he would let her father die.

She suspected it was a scam and hung up.

Still, many people do end up sharing financial information over the phone.

More than $9 billion was lost from phone scams in 2017, up from $7.4 billion in 2015, according to a company that tries to combat such issues, Truecaller.

More than 7 million complaints were filed with the National Do Not Call Registry last year, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

"Phone scams are one of the big problems right now," said Adam Doupe, associate director of the Center for Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Arizona State University. "They're much more effective than email scams."

The growth of the phone scam is, in part, thanks to a new tactic these criminals are using that makes people more likely to answer their calls, and then trust them once they do.

Scammers are increasingly spoofing phone numbers to make them look familiar to you. They might use your area code or the first six digits of a friend's phone number.

Half of all phone scams today use this tactic of digit spoofing, according to a recent analysis by Hiya, a phone spam protection company.

The cyber threat landscape is changing all the time, here's how your business can keep up.

Whether you’re just starting your own company or you’re well on your way to the next stage of business growth, suffering a financial hit could be hugely detrimental.

In a worrying trend, SMEs are increasingly being targeted by scammers whose efforts are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent every year.

In fact, according to new research, nearly half of SMEs (44 per cent) have been targeted by scammers and almost one in four (23 per cent) have fallen victim to fraud.

How can you separate fact from fiction and keep your business safe from fraud in these uncertain times?

Firstly, if you want to safeguard your business, you need to understand and keep up with the current business fraud landscape.

Unfortunately, any business can be targeted by resourceful fraudsters. This is made easier by the fact that scammers can utilise a wealth of information about your organisation listed innocently on internet sites, directory enquiries and Companies House.

Criminals can also use the clearing cycle (common for traditional payment via cheques and bank drafts) to try and influence companies to refund a payment to them before the original funds have even cleared.

Many fraudsters are also turning their attention to business tax, tricking unsuspecting victims with the promise of a rebate.

This involves scammers sending out emails that appear to be from legitimate third-party tax rebate providers or HMRC about a potential refund your business may be eligible to receive. From here, you will be directed to an external website and be asked to fill out a form with sensitive business information.

Sadly, you will actually be passing this on to criminals who can use the data they receive to defraud you out of vital business funds. Never hand out any personal or payment details to companies you haven’t approached personally before or to HMRC who will only ever contact you via post or your employer.

Be alert, all the time!

When it comes to business communication, it has never been more diverse. Post, email, telephone, website forms and social media are now all thrown into the mix.

Unfortunately, this means fraudsters can now target SMEs in an ever-growing number of ways. For example, scammers are still using post (for invoices and cheques) to conn businesses.

Fraudsters will also telephone companies and ask for a contact name whom they can send the invoice to, often posing as a supplier. A written request will then be sent advising you that they have since changed the bank details used to receive regular payments.

To protect your business, undertake an independent check with the company asking for their bank details to be changed using a recognised telephone number and not the one used in the letter.

Similarly, you should never publish your business’s bank account details on your website in case the site gets cloned. Fraudsters can then change the details to their own, meaning customers could end up sending money not to your business, but straight into the hands of criminals.

SMEs should also be mindful of how they use their social media, with scammers now employing elaborate ‘phishing’ scams designed to convince social media users that their accounts have been deactivated, prompting them to “log on”.

Fake communications such as this are becoming more common and are usually delivered via email with another company’s branding and email address. However, there are easy steps you can take to spot a real email message from a fake.

You should always look out for small formatting or spelling mistakes, suspicious security certificates (secure sites should feature a padlock in the browser address bar), contrived email addresses which differ greatly from the company who supposedly sent it or unusual characters in the text.

With business scams becoming increasingly sophisticated, it can seem impossible to keep up to date and ensure your company is protected.

However, there are proactive steps you can take to stay ahead of the fraudsters. Firstly, make sure your staff are up to speed on all the common tactics being used and know what do to in the event of a suspicious communication being received.

Ensure any employee on the front line of communications (anyone answering the phone, collecting mail, answering emails and paying bills) is aware of the ways scammers might try to deceive them.

You should also encourage your team to regularly update their passwords every couple of months and use long ‘passphrases’ with random words separated by spaces as opposed to traditional one-word passwords combining letters, numbers and symbols to make your company’s data less vulnerable.

If you haven’t done so already, be sure to activate multi-factor authentication and password encryption software onto every online account, adding an additional layer of protection.

You should also be aware threats to your business aren’t necessarily just external. The sad truth is that sometimes threats can come from within your business (either intentional deception or innocent mistakes).

Ensure no single person has full control over all the accounting aspects of your business and you have graded permission protocols in place, only giving employees access to company data they need for their day-to-day role.

Additionally, the work of bookkeepers should be checked by directors and payroll should be regularly inspected prior to payment. Make sure you also have a designated sign-off system in place for reviewing and authorising payments to suppliers, new or existing.

Unfortunately, no business is immune from falling victim to scammers and many SMEs don’t report instances of fraud due to fears about reputation damage.

However, if the worst does happen, reporting the incident is vital. By reporting the scam, you might also be able to stop others from facing the same fate too.

If your business has lost money as a result of a scam or you receive a suspicious communication, report it to Action Fraud, the national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre.

To effectively safeguard your business, knowledge is power so make sure to keep yourself and your staff informed of the latest techniques and ways to protect your business to avoid becoming a target.

We’ve all been there before -- you pick up your phone and see an incoming call from a number that appears to be almost exactly the same as your own. On the other line is someone saying they are from "card services" and want to speak to you about your credit card account. The voice most likely prompts you to press a button to be transferred to a representative who can lower your interest rate. Maybe the call is more convincing, possibly from an imposter IRS agent urging you to pay your overdue taxes or risk being arrested. Regardless, these kinds of calls have completely invaded our privacy and caused many of us serious financial losses.

To put this phone scam situation into perspective, my company commissioned a study on phone scams and found nearly 60% of people have received a scam call in the past week, up 113% from the same study in 2017. I have also recently testified on behalf of my company as a witness during the House of Representatives’ hearing that focused on combating robocalls and caller ID spoofing. The committee examined tactics that are commonly used by phone scammers and reviewed the current landscape of solutions.

These unwanted calls -- including illegal and spoofed robocalls -- are currently the top consumer complaint of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and have prompted the agency to take action. To put the issue into context, the FCC issued a $120 million fine to robocall kingpin Adrian Abramovich, who allegedly made 96 million illegal robocalls to trick consumers with an exclusive vacation offer from well-known hospitality and travel companies. Neal O’Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council and a fellow professional in the technology industry, explained that with such a rapid evolution of these crimes, robocalls are no longer just annoying, but very often a means to identity theft: Many criminals believe that if they can get a live victim on the line, they're halfway to a score.

This year, robocalls, yet again, hit an all-time high of 3.4 billion as reported by The New York Times. Scammers have begun using techniques known as neighbor spoofing to disguise their number as one familiar to the person they’re targeting. When people see incoming calls from a familiar number, the likelihood of them answering automatically increases, and the scammer gets a chance to work their magic. With the number of scams being higher than ever before, and these criminals implementing new tactics, it's clear that the phone scam crisis has become a serious threat that requires action on multiple levels. But what solutions are out there, and how do they work to remedy this problem?

How Technology Combats The Rise Of Phone Scams

Some consumers have begun to utilize apps such as RoboKiller or Nomorobo to fight this issue. Through a variety of means, these services identify problematic and illegitimate phone numbers and stop them before users receive them. Some also provide information about every call that reaches the user's phone. While mobile apps provide some scam-blocking functionality, from what I have experienced as a technology professional, this is only part of a multi-pronged solution, as users may still find themselves on the line with a scammer or missing calls from parties they know.

These apps are one of several solutions, many of which depend on a consumer's carrier and model of phone, so researching the right choice is essential. Several companies, including my own, have developed in-network solutions for carriers to identify and block “spoof” calls with new “fingerprinting” technology. Even third-party applications such as the aforementioned Nomorobo have started rolling out their partially embedded network solution.

New Strategies On The Horizon

Over the past several years, the FCC has been urging telecommunication companies to develop solutions to end the unwanted robocall epidemic. The industry responded by creating a new technology standard known as secure telephony identity revisited (STIR) and secure handling of asserted information using tokens (SHAKEN). At its core, every phone has a unique certificate of authenticity attached to it. For example, you place an outbound call to your friend. This call contains a certificate verifying that the call is indeed coming from your number. The phone call then goes to the incoming phone carrier, which then verifies the certificate against a heavily encrypted private key, ensuring the call is legitimate. This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, albeit still in development.

Consumers need to be vigilant in this high-tech landscape, where their data is accessible by any number of companies. It's essential that all consumers carefully read the terms of the agreement before granting any app permissions and keep in mind that when these services are free, it's often the case that you and your network of contacts' data is the price.

Yet this isn't only up to the consumers. Carriers need to protect their customers and their data. At the core of this issue, technology companies and carriers need to consider the safety of their consumers. Solving a problem of this magnitude requires comprehensive solutions that eliminate these scams before they reach your phone. Scammers are increasing the frequency and cleverness of their attacks. All parties that are able to help solve this issue -- the government, application developers and carriers -- must act now.

You’re not imagining it: Scammers are increasingly blowing up your phone.

First Orion, an Arkansas company that provides caller ID and call blocking services, found that the volume of mobile scam calls has risen from 3.7% of total calls in 2017 to 29.2% in 2018. That number is likely to reach 44.6% by early 2019.

First Orion analyzed more than 34 billion calls made with partner T-Mobile USA (tmus) and identified about 12% of them as scams. The 58 million T-Mobile subscribers see “Scam Likely” on the caller ID screen if the service determines a call fraudulent in nature.

During testimony to Congress in a hearing on robocalls and call spoofing this spring, First Orion EVP Scott Hambuchen said, “The fraudsters are very sophisticated, evolving their practices to avoid being labeled or blocked. As a result, we are in an arms race, not a marathon with a finish line, and will be in it until we make it unprofitable.” First Orion said it is deploying a new technology, “CallPrinting,” into a first-tier U.S. carrier network this fall to battle scam traffic.

The scammers are always trying to stay one step ahead, of course: phone number spoofing makes it appear that a number similar to your own is calling you, increasing the likelihood that you’ll pick up. Call-blocking apps only block known scam numbers, not legitimate numbers that are momentarily hijacked by scammers for spoof calls.

More than half of all complaints received by the Federal Communications Commission are about unwanted calls, the reports. The FCC said Americans received about 2.4 billion unwanted automated calls each month in 2016. The FCC issued a $120 million fine earlier this year against a Florida man accused of making nearly 100 million automated calls offering people vacation deals.

Being on the do-not-call registry doesn’t help, because people who run scam businesses likely don’t give a fig about following regulations.

Over the last few months, I’ve noticed extra calls coming in from local numbers, and if you live in the US, I suspect maybe you have too. These calls are either just dead air, or recordings that start with “Please don’t hang up.” Out of curiosity, I’ve called back on the number the call claims to be from. Each time, the message is that this number has been disconnected and is no longer in service. This sounds like the plot of a budget horror movie, how am I being called from a disconnected number? Rather than a phantom in the wires, this is robocalling, combined with caller ID spoofing.

Automated phone switching is an impressive beast. The story often told is that Kansas City had two undertakers in the late 1800s. The town’s telephone operator was married to one of the undertakers, and she would routinely send business to her husband. The other undertaker was [Almon Brown Strowger], and once he caught on to what was going on, he started working on a way to route phone calls without going through an operator. His invention eventually became the rotary dial phone and switching system. There is some irony that the automatically switched telephone network was invented to defeat fraud, and today it’s also used to commit fraud.

Number Spoofing is a Side Effect of the Ma Bell Breakup

At Hope XII, [TProphet] gave a talk about robocalling and the history of the phone system. He talked about the breakup of AT&T and the associated government regulation, and how those two events have had unintended consequences today, like enabling caller ID spoofing and robocalling. Part of the agreement between the U.S. Government and AT&T is that all calls would be accepted, even calls from competing providers. The downside is that this regulation then legally prevented AT&T from blocking phone calls even when those calls are known to be spoofed or spam.

Signalling System 7 (SS7) was designed in the 1970s, and has become the international standard for routing phone calls. This standard was written in a time when network security was an afterthought: SS7 has no authentication built in, simply accepting all traffic on the “secure” phone network. Regulated network interconnection was baked into the SS7 protocol, and a side effect is that the source phone number is trusted by design. Caller ID spoofing is the result of this protocol and the regulatory requirement that telephone companies (telcos) complete all calls from competitors.

[TProphet] didn’t mention the legitimate reason for caller ID Spoofing. Your humble author spoofs the caller ID of his office phone. Why? An Asterisked phone system (running off a Raspberry Pi) connects to both a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) line as well as a VoIP trunk. Incoming calls to the phone number, as well as outgoing local calls, go over the POTS line. Long distance outgoing calls go over the VoIP trunk, as the per minute rates are significantly better. In Asterisk, when routing the outgoing call, there is a simple routing command that sets the outgoing caller ID information. It’s accurate information in this case, but this is the exact same process as a robocaller uses to spoof calls.

Most hotels and other large businesses do spoofing of some sort, in order to show all their calls as originating from their main number. If the caller ID is set in order to funnel return calls to the primary incoming phone number, all is well. If the spoofed number doesn’t serve to allow returned calls, but instead is intended to deceive, then fraud has occurred.

So what’s the solution? The FCC has recently taken aim at robocalls, and has changed its regulations as part of this push. Telcos are now allowed to block spoofed calls that claim to be originating from disconnected numbers, as well as certain other obviously spoofed numbers. Cell phone companies have started showing warnings about incoming spam calls, and even blocking some calls.

Part of the reason for Gmail’s rapid growth was its excellent spam detection. Now that telcos and cell providers have some regulatory breathing room, they are beginning to compete for the best robocall blocking. T-mobile, for instance, uses a service that monitors call originators for recent call volume. If one location just fired off a thousand phone calls, it’s probably doing robocalling. If you’ve seen a caller ID message of “Spam Likely” on your cell phone, you’ve been the beneficiary of this service. [TProphet] even described a scheme to catch and block spam calls as a service. At the end of his talk, he outlined how the SS7 metadata included with a spam call could be categorized and scored, in order to determine how likely a given call is to be spam.

This is very similar to the operating principle of Spamassassin, one of the more popular open source email spam filters. Just as Spamassassin looks at the email source, headers, and text; a robocalling filter could look at the origination, timing, and other metadata to determine a spam rating. The parallel between robocalls and email spam would suggest that robocalls will never fully disappear, but better service and smarter regulation will eventually reduce them to an occasional annoyance.

The unity of the telephone network has turned out to be one of its major strengths — Imagine a world where you needed an AT&T subscription, a Sprint subscription, and a Verizon subscription, just to be able to talk to family and do business. The regulatory agreement with AT&T, combined with later legislation brought about this unification. However as we’ve seen, it did come with unintended side effects, like enabling robocallers.

There is another regulatory good idea that could have some unintended side effects. Net neutrality is the idea that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should provide neutral internet service. We pay our ISPs for our bandwidth, and it’s reasonable to expect that bandwidth to be provided without services being blocked or throttled. Net neutrality regulations would insist that ISPs deliver packets in this unbiased way.

To be clear, I’m of the opinion that net neutrality is a good idea. An ISP shouldn’t be able to shake a customer down for a higher monthly fee, just to get unthrottled access to a competitor’s video streams.

In order to ensure net neutrality, ISPs were temporarily reclassified as “Common Carriers”, similarly to how the Bell telephone system was regulated. In order to understand how this classification might be a sub-optimal solution to achieving net neutrality, consider what traffic ISPs regularly block. For example, port 25 is reserved for the Simple Mail Transport Protocol, and is routinely blocked on residential internet connections. Why? Port 25 traffic from a residence is almost always spam, being sent from a compromised computer. Would an ISP regulated as a common carrier be allowed to block that traffic?

Regulations often have unintended side effects, and bodies like the FCC are usually slow to update rules to fix those unintended consequences. The requirement for all telephone networks to play nicely together opened up the call spoofing vulnerability that delivered this abundance of robocalls. So far fining robocallers and having regulators harrumph at telcos hasn’t solved it. The balancing act for any network is to keep it accessible to legitimate traffic without compromising the ability to combat traffic that is clearly malicious or fraudulent.

Twenty-one people involved in a massive fraud and money laundering conspiracy were sentenced to up to 20 years in jail, the Department of Justice announced Friday, joining three other conspirators sentenced earlier this year. The operation, based out of call centers in India, targeted U.S. residents in telephone scams where they posed as representatives from the IRS. During the four years the operation was active, more than 15,000 U.S. residents were scammed out of hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 50,000 people had their personal information misused, the reports.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it the “first-ever large scale, multi-jurisdiction prosecution targeting the India call center scam industry.” The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Treasury Department worked for years to shut down this fraud ring.

Between 2012 and 2016, the sentenced individuals used information obtained from data brokers and other sources to scam vulnerable populations, including immigrants and elderly persons. With a caller I.D. of “U.S. Government,” conspirators posed as IRS or immigration officials over the phone, threatening arrest, deportation, or other penalties if the U.S. residents didn’t immediately pay them through prepaid cards or money wire transfers.

If the victim agreed to pay their alleged debts, the money was routed through the call centers to a network of runners located in the U.S. The runners would then “liquidate and launder the extorted funds as quickly as possible by purchasing reloadable cards or retrieving wire transfers,” the DOJ reports.

To help taxpayers avoid similar scams, the IRS provides a fact sheet explaining they will never call demanding immediate payment. Tax payments are always requested through mail, and taxpayers are given the opportunity to question or appeal the amount owed. The IRS said it will never threaten to have you arrested.

“The IRS also cannot revoke your driver’s license, business licenses, or immigration status,” according to the fact sheet. “Threats like these are common tactics scam artists use to trick victims into buying into their schemes.”

The 21 individuals sentenced in a Houston court last week were located throughout the U.S. during the scheme. The reports they resided in Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, Indiana, New Jersey, and Texas.

Twenty-two of the defendants have been held jointly liable for restitution payments over $8.9 million to victims of the scam, the DOJ reports. The court also included money judgements over $72.9 million in last week’s sentences.

The court has also indicted 32 India-based conspirators and five India-based call centers with “general conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy,” but no arraignments have taken place.

To be a step ahead of the latest scam‚ don’t return a missed call from an international number you do not recognise.

This is the advice of advocate Jaqueline Fick‚ head of forensic services at Cell C.

This fraud‚ which can cost the caller R100 or R200 for single call‚ is "on the increase" in South Africa‚ she warned. Fick was speaking at the Annual Association of Certified Fraud Examiners African Conference in Sandton on Tuesday.

The way the fraud works is that scammers buy "premium" phone lines that charge a lot‚ such as R100 a minute‚ and then use software to send missed calls to hundreds of thousands of people.

A small percent of people return the call thinking they have missed an important phone call from a friend‚ relative or business abroad. What they don’t realise is that it costs them up to a R100 or more a minute because they are dialling this “premium number”.

The caller often hears someone pick up the phone and then may hear noise and be asked to wait while the person tries to get a clearer line. The scammer is trying to keep them on the phone for as long as possible. In some cases‚ scammers play the caller a recording of people fighting and the confused caller may stay on the line even longer trying to work out what is happening‚ explained Fick.

This fraud has a name: “Wangiri Fraud” - which Fick said “sounds like something you would put in a salad”. Wangiri is actually Japanese for “one ring and drop”. This is what happens. Your phone rings and then stops before you can answer it.

Have you just received a phone call that appears to be from your own number? If so, it’s likely a spoofed call that a scammer has set up in order to get you to answer their phone scam.

I can personally attest to this clever trick. I just recently got a call from my cell phone that claimed to be from my own number. Once I answered, I heard a message in an automated male voice, stating:

Apart from the weird phrasing (I’m not sure what “compromised by AT&T” is supposed to mean), there are a few ways to tell that this is a scam.
• First, robocalls aren’t a common way for brands to contact their customers
• Next, the call never personally identifies whose account they’re calling about, shifting the burden of identification to the listener — this allows the scammer to record a one-size-fits-all message
• Finally, it asks for four social security digits — personal information that a scammer often fishes for.

So why is this such a clever phone scam? Because it addresses the biggest challenge a phone scammer faces: How to get a victim to pick up the phone in the first place.

Personally, I never answer my phone if I don’t recognize the number, and this attitude is growing among a younger generation, too. When texting, emailing, or even Facebook messaging are the go-to options, why bother answering an unknown caller? Because, this scam hopes, you’re so confused by seeing your own number that you answer just to find out what’s going on.

Then, the scam offers an easy explanation. The automated voice claims to be from your own phone carrier.

I do indeed use AT&T — this scam potentially targets only AT&T customers, as this is still a huge base. Granted, it doesn’t make a lot of sense that a phone carrier would call from its clients’ numbers rather than their own, but it only has to make a moment of sense to trick a few people into giving up their social security digits.

If you want to avoid fielding scam calls all day, you have a few options.

If you don’t pick up the phone when you don’t recognize the number, you’ll avoid this phone scam and any like it. The downside? Sometimes you’ll miss a legitimate call.

Join the Do Not Call List

The federally run Do Not Call list is able to keep some — but far from all — robocalls away from your number. Since scammers aren’t exactly concerned with staying legal, they’ll likely keep calling, but you’ll see a reduction in the number of automated calls.

If you’re suspicious of a call, don’t say very much. Even just a simple “yes” in your voice could be recorded and played back by a scammer who wants to impersonate you.

Phone scams are getting worse. In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission logged 4.5 million complaints about robocalls in 2017 — more than twice the 2.18 million complaints they saw in 2013, according to a recent New York Times article.

The call-from-your-own number AT&T-impersonating phone scam has been making the rounds since at least September 2017, as Good Housekeeping has covered in the past. A variation, where the phone number is spoofed to have the same area code, has been around even longer.

Scammers will keep using these scams as long as they’re still working, so stay vigilant. Above all, if someone calls you from your own phone number, don’t bother picking up.

May 30, 2018. Detective Superintendent Linda Howlett in Sydney says an international phone scam targeting Chinese expats has scammed more than $5 million from thousands of NSW residents. Det Supt Howlett says fraudsters are impersonating consulate staff, threatening violence and forcing their victims to stage their own kidnapping. “We want to close this scam down,” Det Supt Howlett said. (AAP Video/Iain Boyd)

IN RECENT months, you may have been confused by a voicemail left on your phone in Mandarin.

Whether you understand it or not, authorities have warned smartphone users to hang up immediately.

Police have warned of a phone scam targeting Chinese nationals in Australia by pretending to be from the embassy and demanding a large sum of money.

News.com.au reported on the scam in detail earlier this week.

“We have offenders contacting victims on the phone purporting to be from the Chinese Embassy, and saying victims either committed an offence or had their identity stolen. As a result, victims are asked to pay fines or a debt,” Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Linda Howlett told a conference on Wednesday afternoon.

“I want to stress that the Chinese Embassy would never contact a victim to pay money over the phone.

“We’ve had incidents where the victim is threatened, or their family back in China is threatened.”

She said there have been cases where the victim didn’t have any money. In these cases, the victim was instructed to stage a kidnapping so they could get money overseas from their parents.

The scam has reaped in millions of dollars, targeting victims across Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. One victim in NSW had $1.9 million stolen.

According to Det Supt Howlett, there have been at least 50 reports of this incident across NSW, with three calls this week alone.

But she said a lot of the victims still aren’t coming forward, urging people receiving the calls to hang up and let the authorities know.

Variations of this scam have been reported recently. In another one, an automated voice in Mandarin claiming to be calling on behalf of the Chinese Embassy tells the listener they had an important parcel to collect.

They are encouraged to press 9, at which point they are transferred to a scammer who tries to take their personal details.

China’s Deputy Consul-General in Sydney Tong Xuejun said more than 1000 cases had been reported since August last year.

“We have confirmed about 40 cases that caused a loss. The total amount of money involved is about $10 million,” he said, adding that the money lost ranged from $2000 to one case of $3.5 million.

In another, the scammer tells the victim they are involved in a crime like money-laundering or embezzlement, and threatens them with jail or deportation unless they pay a hefty sum to get a “priority investigation” to clear their name.

They also try to extract sensitive information like passport numbers, bank details and addresses.

According to Scamwatch, if the money is sent to the scammer, it is likely lost and extremely difficult to recover.

Many non-Chinese people have reported getting the calls too, and being left confused.

The Chinese Consulate-General has urged Chinese citizens in Australia to be aware of fraudulent calls.

MOLINE, Illinois -- A Milan woman said she was nearly duped by a scam phone call because the caller knew her Social Security number. The Quad City Better Business Bureau said it's part of a two-year-old phone scam that is resurfacing in the area.

Trisha Brooks, from Milan, Illinois, received a call Tuesday, September 18, while she was at work. The caller knew her Social Security number and demanded $1,800. The caller said she wrote a bad check and was going to be served papers if she didn't pay.

"They told me I owed money from eight years ago," Brooks said. " They said I needed to be in court and they were going to serve me papers for fraud and theft of services."

The call came from Chicago, Illinois and when the scammer said her Social Security number, Brooks was convinced it was a legitimate call.

"My mind was just spinning," Brooks said. "I thought I was in big trouble, so I asked them if I could just pay it." That is when the scammers told her the dollar amount and Brooks saw the red flags. She knew that was off and told the scammers she needed a bill to be mailed to her, then she hung up. After the call, Brooks searched the numbers online and found nine pages of people who received calls just like her.

The Quad Cities Better Business Bureau said that just because a caller knows your Social Security number, does not mean it is legitimate.

"If somebody calls you and wants money over the phone and you don't know who they are, don't give them any money, " Better Business Bureau Director Sandra Bowden said. "I don't care how they threaten you, I don't care what they say to you, don't do it."

The Better Business Bureau says that all legitimate businesses must provide billing and documents by mail and in writing. You can track popular scams in your area on the BBB Scam Tracker.

ENCINITAS, Calif. (KGTV) -- Police are investigating an elaborate phone scam that cost an Encinitas woman $1,400.

Lauren Kennedy says she was driving to work Wednesday morning when she received a phone call around 8:30 a.m. She says she had just gotten off the phone with her mother when all of a sudden, she was calling her back.

But when she answered, it wasn’t her mother’s voice.

“It was a man’s voice telling me he had abducted my mother and he was going to kill her if I didn't do exactly as he told me,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy said it became so real when she heard her mother’s voice on the other line.

“At that point, that’s when I knew it was real," she said. "I heard her in the background, and I thought for sure that they had taken her.”

The man on the other line directed her to go to the nearest grocery store and put money into Money Pak cards. Then they demanded the card numbers over the phone and ordered her to destroy the cards afterward.

They told her to cut up the cards and email them photo evidence that they had been destroyed.

“At that time, he hung up and never called me back,” she explained. “So, within a minute or two, I called my mom’s phone and at that time, she answered.”

That’s when Kennedy’s realized she had fallen victim to an elaborate phone scam.

The Sheriff’s Department says the scammers used a “spoofing device” to make it look like the phone was made from her mother’s phone number.

The scammers also called Kennedy’s’ mother in the middle of the fake ransom call. They got her worked up by saying they had her daughter.

“They just wanted her to be scared and sound scared. All I heard was her saying my name. I still can't believe it," Kennedy said. “I think their whole intention with calling her was to have her voice in the background while they were asking me to do whatever they wanted me to do."

Kennedy says she not sure how the scammers got her information or her mother’s. She says she is always careful with her information and weary of scams.

“I don't answer phone calls I don't recognize,” she said. “I don't answer blocked numbers. I let people leave voicemails to determine if it’s legit or not. I feel like the public needs to know about this (scam) because if I can fall for this, anybody can fall for this.”

In an email, to 10News the Sheriff’s Department says people should hang up when they get phone calls like this and should immediately call law enforcement.

Kennedy says that's what her mother did when she got the call, but for her - it’s easier said than done.

“This was life or death," she said. "They were threatening to kill my mom."

In a statement, the Sheriff’s Department also wants to remind the public to be careful with their personal information:

“We also recommend not posting personal information such as phone numbers, family member names, addresses, school information, birthdays, etc. on social media. When in doubt, call the Sheriff's Department or your local law enforcement agency.”

The website of the Treasury inspector general for tax administration has an online form to report I.R.S. impersonations. It includes sections for reporting how much you paid to the perpetrators of the fraud, and whether you provided personal information. A personal identification number is assigned to the case so you can confirm that any agent who follows up is legitimate.

You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, which investigates consumer fraud.

If you’ve been scammed and you file a complaint, you might be entitled to restitution if a court orders defendants to pay up. You’ll only have a limited amount of time to claim losses, because the court may amend restitution orders for up to 60 days after sentencing. In the case of the India call centers, that date would be in mid-September. The claim form for that case is online.

If you used a wire transfer to pay a con artist, you should contact the wire transfer company. The MoneyGram Customer Care Center is 1‑800‑926‑9400. The Western Union Fraud Hotline is 1-800-448-1492.

The I.R.S. generally contacts people by mail. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from the agency, do not open attachments or click on links. Forward it to phishing@irs.gov.

It is not always the I.R.S. that is being impersonated. Be aware, and learn to recognize a scam when you see or hear one.

The indictment pertaining to the Justice Department’s recent convictions described other ploys used by the conspirators. Some calls were purported to be from immigration officials who threatened deportation unless bogus fines were paid. Another technique was to pretend to be a payday lender and promise a loan if a fee was paid upfront, and then the loan would never materialize, the indictment said.

Federal agencies have pages where consumers can browse scams by type, and the list suggests that there is no end to the creativity of crooked callers.

The St. George Police Department received several reports Wednesday afternoon regarding a possible phone scam wrongfully connected to a city number.

According to SGPD Officer Tiffany Atkin, the scammers may have "cloned" the City of St. George's phone number to reach out to businesses and individuals regarding their power bill.

Using the seemingly-legitimate number, the scammers speak to the individuals and urge them they need to pay their power bill within a short period of time or else it will be shut off.

Atkin said the individuals are then asked to meet at various locations across the city to pay. By Wednesday afternoon, one local business owner had been victimized by the scam, while several other residents simply called to report the calls as suspicious.

"People have called it in to report that it was suspicious," Atkin said. "Some haven't fallen for it. It looks like (the scammers) are targeting businesses for the most part, but they're also hitting private persons, too."

The investigation is in its early stages, Atkin said, and police are not yet certain how the scammers have gained access to the number.

There are no suspects at this time.

"We don't want any more victims," Atkin said.

A few hours after receiving a phone call from the person he thought was the Jasper County Sheriff regarding a contempt of court citation, Dr. Paul Sommer was still visibly aggravated by the time I arrived at his office.

The Valparaiso podiatrist also has a satellite office in DeMotte, a small town in Jasper County. So when the county sheriff’s office called him about failing to appear for jury duty at the county courthouse, it sounded legitimate to Sommer, if not factual.

“I thought maybe it was mailed to my DeMotte office,” Sommer explained to me last week during my appointment with him at his Valparaiso office. “But we don’t receive any mail at that office address.”

The caller, who sounded rude yet confident posing as a county sheriff officer, told Sommer there was an open warrant for his arrest for failing to appear. And that an Oct. 3 court date was already set for Sommer’s hearing at the county courthouse.

“Jury duty? Contempt of court? Bench warrant?” asked Sommer, who’s one of the most level-headed and even-keeled people I know.

The call came from Remington, Ind., according to his office’s caller ID. The officer’s name was “Ed Cox,” who even gave his badge number to Sommer.

“It all sounded weird, but…” Sommer told me that day.

But… all it takes is a hint of plausibility to believe any phone scam. But… no one wants to casually ignore or dismiss the county sheriff. But… what if the phone call is actually legitimate, even with inaccurate details?

These are the questions that swirled through Sommer’s mind when he took that call.

The caller told Sommer that his contempt of court citation and bench warrant could be expunged from the courts system if Sommer – you guessed it – paid the caller money. In this case, through two $500 “vouchers” from a local pharmacy store.

Sommer and his staff immediately contacted that pharmacy and they also contacted police. They discovered what Sommer suspected all along.

“It was all a scam, targeting doctors, too,” he told me later that afternoon.

“It is definitely a scam,” Jasper County Sheriff Terry Risner told me afterward. “I am truly sorry that this has caused people, such as your doctor, any heartache.”

His office has since posted a warning on its website, www.jaspercountypolice.com, which also lists several other phone scams.

“The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office has received several complaints from concerned citizens reporting a new telephone scam circulating Jasper County,” the warning states. “The Jasper County Sheriff's Office will not make telephone calls to individuals threatening arrest warrants and demanding money.”

The sheriff’s office said people with questions about a scam should call the sheriff’s office administration line is (219) 866-4950.

According to the Federal Trade Commission website, “Every year, thousands of people lose money to telephone scams — from a few dollars to their life savings. Scammers will say anything to cheat people out of money.”

That agency offers tips and warnings to avoid being scammed on a phone call. For more information, visit www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0076-phone-scams.

Sommer agreed to share his encounter with a phone scam caller with the hope it will help others be better prepared and a bit more skeptical of such calls.

“I admit, I was fooled at first,” Sommer said.

Before I left Sommer’s office that day, he asked if I had ever considered hosting a public workshop for anyone interested in learning more about the craft of writing. I’ve hosted many workshops through the years – for connecting with media outlets and connecting with other people – but never one specifically for writing.

“You should give it a thought,” Sommer told me.

After giving it some thought, I asked my social media readers if anyone would be interested in such a workshop. I received an overwhelming amount of feedback from aspiring writers, veteran journalists and others who simply want to transform their swirling thoughts and feelings into written words with better skill and more authenticity.

So I’m arranging to host my first “Writing 101 Workshop,” designed with a Power Point presentation and real examples from my work and other writers’ work. The 60- to 90-minute workshop will be for new writers, veteran wordsmiths and anyone who wants to learn more about the art and science of writing.

I write at least 1,000 words every day for my newspaper columns, magazine stories and book projects, and I’ll do my best to share what I’ve learned over the course of my 25-year career. As you may know, I was not formally trained to be a professional writer, so my workshop will likely be informal and unconventional.

The Lake County Public Library’s main branch on U.S. 30 in Merrillville has generously offered to host the workshop, with the tentative date of 1 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 10. I’ve learned that this branch is centrally located for Post-Tribune readers across Northwest Indiana.

If you’re interested in attending, feel free to register at the library or email me at jdavich@post-trib.com or text me at 219-713-7237. Or simply show up that day.

I’ll provide more details and updates as that date nears, and thanks for your interest.

Finally, a sincere thank you to all the grandparents who contacted me after reading my recent column on becoming a new grandfather last month.

“I loved your honesty about not being so excited until the birth and about the fact that you were not going to write about it, but you did. Congratulations Pops!” wrote Kay Volkert, of Aurora, Ill.

I feel as though I’ve been inducted into an elite, privileged club without doing anything for proper admission. I’ll try to pay my dues by being the best Pops I can be.

Cabel Sasser narrowly avoided having his bank account emptied last week by a swindler running an ATM card scam, an escape from a financial nightmare that he recounted in a string of tweets.

The attempted fraud was carried out by an unknown male phone caller who had Sasser's Social Security number and appeared to be calling from the security department at Wells Fargo, the bank where Sasser has an account.

The attack marked a more sophisticated variation on older scams and represents a cautionary tale for millions of American consumers. The results of a consumer poll on phone scams and spam issued in April 2018 by Truecaller, a mobile app that helps block unwanted calls, showed that an estimated 1 of every 10 U.S. adults had been victimized by a phone scam during the preceding 12 months, with an average loss of $357 per victim.

"Unfortunately, phishing scams like these are all too common, and the fraudsters can be convincing," said Sarah Grano, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association. "The best thing to do is trust your gut" and hang up if a call "seems suspicious."

Sasser, a co-founder of Panic, a software company and video game producer based in Portland, Oregon, said he was not suspicious at first. His cellphone's caller identification system showed the call apparently came from the 800 number listed on the back of his Wells Fargo ATM card.

A male caller identified himself as a fraud department agent and said the card had just been used for purchases at a Target store in Minnesota, more than 1,500 miles away from Sasser's home.

"It was a very smooth, very authentic-sounding call," Sasser said in a telephone interview. "I've had this happen so many times that I didn't even flinch at the fact that, great, another card got used someplace where it shouldn't be used."

Answering questions from the caller, Sasser said he had the card in his possession. The caller had him verify the card's security code. Then, the man read some disclosures related to obtaining a replacement ATM card. The procedure, familiar from previous security calls, "helped with the believability," Sasser said.

Next, the man asked him to key in a different personal identification code for the new card via his cellphone. That raised a red flag.

"There were no computer prompts or anything. I was just literally pushing numbers on my phone that he's just hearing on the other end," Sasser said. "I was starting to get a little nervous."

Finally, the man asked him to enter his current PIN number into the phone.

"That was the moment that pushed me over the edge – something is definitely not right here," Sasser said. "I asked him point blank, 'Don't you know my PIN number ... you're the bank?'"

The man said he couldn't see the number and then tried to allay suspicion by reading the last four digits of Sasser's Social Security number. Sasser said the numbers were correct, but something was "very wrong."

Now all but certain he was being scammed, Sasser nonetheless said he reflexively shied away from being rude.

"Somehow, I found the courage to push through that hesitation," said Sasser. "I said, 'I'm sorry ... something about this seems weird. I'm just going to call the number on the back of my card."

The man sounded "kind of defeated" as the call ended Sasser said. But a real Wells Fargo representative was anything but crestfallen when Sasser called the bank's security office.

"I spoke to a guy who was incredibly happy that I had stopped when I did," because many people don't and lose money, said Sasser. "He definitely said 'there had been no attempted fraud on your card, and that whole story had been totally made up.'"

Such scams are anything but uncommon.

In all, 77,999 people who filed complaints with the federal Do Not Call Registry in 2017 reported imposter frauds from live callers, according to the Federal Trade Commission. An additional 179,925 complaints reported similar frauds from recorded robocalls.

The Truecaller poll from April found that 18 percent of the respondents who said they had received scam calls during the preceding 12-month period cited bank problems, including calls that sought sensitive information about accounts.

In many cases, the scammers have already gathered information about potential victims, said Lauren Saunders, the Associate Director of the National Consumer Law Center. Social Security numbers can be bought in bulk on the Dark Web and other sites. Phone numbers for security departments at a bank, or other companies, can be spoofed so they appear on caller ID systems.

"Caller ID can be programmed to say whatever someone wants it to say," said Amy Nofziger, an AARP expert on consumer frauds.

Wells Fargo declined to comment on the phishing call reported by Sasser. However, the San Francisco-based bank said scams are "becoming more commonplace."
• Banks won't ask for PIN codes, so be suspicious of a call from anyone who does, said Nofziger. And don't shy away from confronting a suspected scam caller. "It is not rude to take control of the situation and take control of your financial security," she said.
• If you receive a phone call seeking information or access to an account, hang up and contact the financial company by using the number on your ATM card or on the firm's website, Wells Fargo said.
• Don't provide your account information or Social Security number to anyone who contacts you by phone or online, the American Bankers Association said. Use a combination of letters and numbers for passwords, and change them frequently.

Reflecting on the incident, Sasser said the scam was more sophisticated than anything he'd previously encountered. That's one of the reasons he shared the details.

"It tells me that the thieves are getting smarter, which means that we have to be getting smarter," he said.

State officials are warning Iowans not to fall prey to yet another phone scam in which they said someone is falsely impersonating "Iowa State Police."

The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is warning of a scam targeting citizens by misrepresenting the staff of the Iowa Department of Public Safety, according to a news release Thursday.



 DCI officials received reports that scammers are posing as employees of the “Iowa State Police," claiming they have a seized vehicle with drugs inside and that the vehicle is registered to the person they're calling.

Individuals say they received multiple calls from the same 712 area code phone number, according to the news release.

If the person does not answer or hangs up on the initial call, a secondary call is being reported as coming from 911 and the scammers are verbally aggressive, claiming they are with the “police,” and that they have a warrant for the individuals arrest, according to the release.

The calls are similar to a scam that targeted Dallas County residents in which a scammer said they were with the local sheriff's office.

Anyone who receives a similar phone call should contact local law enforcement and the Iowa Attorney General’s Office Hotline at (515) 281-5926 or (888) 777-4590.

The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation offered the following tips to identify a scam:
• If you get a call from someone who claims they are collecting money on behalf of the Department of Public Safety — even if a caller ID device shows the DPS — hang up.
• The DPS does not demand immediate payment via prepaid debit cards.
• Do not provide or confirm personal information or financial information to anyone who calls.

Mobile phones in Kenya are like bank accounts - some people keep all their savings on their phone - and fraudsters are trying to hack into them to steal the money.

Sammy Wanaina received a text message on Sunday asking him to provide the secret personal code so that his Sim card could be swapped.

He was confused, he had not asked for a new card - and just moments earlier he had terminated a call that he now realised must have been from a fraudster who had posed as a customer services adviser from the phone company.

"It was a brief call and I did not give any of my details," Mr Wanaina told the BBC.

He immediately contacted Safaricom, his mobile provider, to report that he suspected that there was an ongoing attempted fraud on his number.

Despite not giving out his details - and reporting the fraud to Safaricom - he completely lost access to his number and only getting back control after three days.

He tweeted that the whole experience had scared him.

Mr Wanaina says Safaricom contacted him after his complaint and issued him with a new Sim card as a precaution - without giving further details about how he lost access to his number.

The company tweeted him to say it was "committed to safeguarding customer information and... that we will follow up this matter to its conclusion".

His story prompted others to share their experiences - many of whom had lost money in the scam.

Politician Stanley Wanjiku revealed that he had been trapped by the fraudsters, losing $18.000 (£14,000).

He told the Daily Nation newspaper that his trouble started after he received a notification that he could not access his mobile wallet and had to call a certain number to reset it - which he did.

He later learned that his Pin number has been replaced and a new one regenerated, so he could not get access to his money. The paper did not say which service he had his account.

"I do not know how my mobile money Pin was regenerated and issued to strangers. I am at a loss how they identified themselves," Mr Wanjiku said, adding that a bank account not linked to his mobile phone was also hacked.
• Why the mobile wallet failed in South Africa

People tend to have several Sim cards from different companies - as they have different coverage and deals. This means Sim cards do get damaged, so it's not unusual for customers to want to replace them.

Kenya has the highest number of users of mobile money in the world, a major reason why the recent Sim card fraud has caused such public alarm.

Almost half of its 47 million population use the dominant M-Pesa platform to pay for services and conduct businesses.

Through partnerships, phone companies have also managed to integrate mobile money services with banks, allowing customers to seamlessly move money back and forth.

William Makatiani, from the cyber-security consulting firm Serianu, told the Daily Nation that the scam to hack into mobile phones is becoming more common.

"Sim swapping has become a big problem especially in Nigeria since 2016. It started picking up in Kenya in the last half of last year," he was quoted as saying.

How to protect yourself

It is not clear how exactly the scam is working, but this week the Communication Authority of Kenya, the body that regulates the mobile phone industry, told users to be on their guard:
• Delete requests for financial information or passwords

Safaricom also urged customers to safeguard their passwords, dates of birth and national identity numbers.

It also said that subscribers should be aware of its official customer care number so as not to be duped by those trying to get access their account.

COLD SPRING -- A recent phone scam is circulating in Cold Spring and it's fooling people into thinking they're talking to a local person.

Cold Spring Police Chief Jason Blum says they've received several calls last month and this month about an IRS phone scam. Many of the calls are appearing as local numbers.

"They [the scammers] are using computerized dialers so they can make it look like a local phone number and we've had some come up as local businesses on the caller ID so people actually think they are talking to someone that they may or should know. Which is not the case, they're disguising their phone numbers which make it difficult for us to track anything down on our end."

Blum says the scam is like many others that claim you either owe money to the IRS or need to bail someone out of jail.

"The big one right now is you have back taxes from the IRS and local law enforcement have a warrant out for your arrest if you don't give us the money. So we're just trying to inform people about what's going on. A lot of these scams are happening and people are still spending money on them."

Many of the scammers tell people they need to mail gift cards out of state to cover their back taxes or bail someone out of jail. Police would like to remind you that the IRS or any law enforcement agency will never accept gift cards as payment.

The best way to protect yourself is to ask questions. If you suspect it's a scam call the police.

It may be summer, but the bad guys aren’t taking a vacation. The Acting Inspector General of Social Security, Gale Stallworth Stone, has issued a warning about an ongoing phone scam from thieves pretending to be from the Social Security Administration (SSA).

As part of the con, scammers try to convince you to give up personal information, like Social Security numbers and bank account numbers, over the phone. In another case, a caller claims to be from “SSA headquarters” and asks you to confirm personal information, such as an SSN, "new" Medicare number, address, and date of birth.

Many of these calls are “robocalls” or automated calls. In one robocall version of the scam, an automated recording declares that your Social Security number (SSN) “has been suspended for suspicion of illegal activity,” and advises to contact a specific phone number immediately. The robocall or caller may also warn that if you don’t call back, your assets or benefits will be frozen until your alleged issue is resolved.

Robocalls from scammers pretending to be from government agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), continue to be problematic. They are cheap and easy and allows thieves to reach the largest number of victims possible.

You may recall that a "Robocall Strike Force” was established in 2016 to develop solutions to prevent, detect, and filter unwanted robocalls. The task force was made up of communications companies including cell and landline service providers, phone manufacturers, operating system (OS) developers and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Members included such communications leaders as Apple, Bandwidth, Comcast, Google, Microsoft, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, two years later, there doesn’t seem to be any real progress made to stop robocalls.

According to an FCC spokesperson, "This industry-led effort produced two detailed reports to the Commission and which were instrumental in laying the groundwork for both on-going FCC policy-making efforts and industry technological work. FCC work that used the Strike Force’s recommendations includes work to reduce robocalls to reassigned numbers, the new FCC rules allowing phone companies to proactively block calls that are likely to be fraudulent, and FCC work to encourage implementation of call authentication. The Commission continues to consult with a wide variety of stakeholders though there are no current plans to formally reconvene this group. Rather, the Strike Force’s reports served their purpose by spurring and framing on-going Commission and industry action to help consumer avoid illegal robocalls."

The FCC has issued some tips for dealing with robocalls. They include:
• If you answer the phone and the caller - or a recording - asks you to hit a button to stop getting the calls, you should just hang up. Scammers often use this trick to identify potential targets.
• Do not respond to any questions, especially those that can be answered with “Yes." (You can find out more about the dangers of saying “yes” to robocalls here.)
• Talk to your phone company about call blocking tools they may have and check into apps that you can download to your mobile device to block unwanted calls.
• If you use robocall-blocking technology already, it often helps to let that company know which numbers are producing unwanted calls so they can help block those calls for you and others.
• To block telemarketing calls, register your number on the Do Not Call List.

In the meantime, robocalls and phone calls made by scammers and thieves continue to be problematic. It’s especially confusing because the IRS has repeatedly advised taxpayers that they will not reach out by phone to resolve taxpayer issues. However, SSA employees do occasionally reach out by telephone for customer-service purposes. Further, the SSA says that in “a few limited special situations” which are “usually” already known to the citizen, an SSA employee may confirm personal information over the phone.

The Acting Inspector General of Social Security, Gale Stallworth Stone, warns folks to be cautious, and to avoid providing information such as your SSN or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are certain of who is receiving it. “Be aware of suspicious calls from unknown sources, and when in doubt, contact the official entity to verify the legitimacy of the call,” Stone said. The SSA advises that if you receive a suspicious call from someone alleging to be from SSA, report that information to the OIG at 1.800.269.0271 or online.

I would go a step further: When in doubt, assume it’s a scam. If you’re not sure whether a call is legitimate, hang up and call back using an official number (don't just use the caller ID number on your phone since those can be spoofed). To reach IRS, call 1.800.829.1040. To contact Social Security, call 1.800.772.1213.

If you know that it’s a scam, don't engage with scammers or thieves, even if you want to tell them that you know it's a scam, or you think that you can best them. Just hang up.

The IRS says that phone scams are still "a major threat to taxpayers." In early 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Remember that the IRS will never:
• Call to demand immediate payment over the phone, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.
• Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
• Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
• Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.
• Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

The phone call in early June purporting to be from Chinese authorities was, in a word, alarming. The Massachusetts woman who answered it learned she may have been the victim of identity theft.

But after almost a week of corresponding and sharing personal information over the phone in an effort to find how her identity had apparently been stolen things went very wrong very quickly.

“It turned from trying to be helpful, as you potentially are a victim of identity theft in China, to there’s an international arrest warrant out for your arrest,” said Jeremy Warnick, director of communications and media relations for the Cambridge Police Department.

The woman, whom police did not identify, ended up wiring $95,000 to a bank in Hong Kong to avoid what she thought would be her arrest and removal from the U.S., according to Warnick.

Only after did she realize she had fallen victim to a phone scam.

A popular version of the ruse, which appears to have taken off earlier this year, involves a robocall message in Mandarin that identifies itself as the Chinese consulate and tells the person who picks up that there’s an important document to retrieve.

It may also direct recipients of the call to provide information to avoid getting into trouble with the consulate, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

Asked about the extent of the Chinese consulate scam, FTC spokesman Frank Dorman said in an email that there’s “no way to estimate the scope of any kind of fraud.”

But reports of it have come in from across the country, from New York to Massachusetts to California, prompting the Chinese embassy in the U.S. to issue an alert on its official website.

“We would like to restate that the Embassy and Consulates General of China would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls,” read the advisory, dated April 19. “The Embassy would not ask for bank account information.”

A big part of the scam’s success involves what’s known as spoofing, a process in which scam artists make it appear as if a call is originating from a legitimate phone number, like that of the Chinese consulate.

Around a half year ago, legislation sponsored by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., was signed into law as part of the omnibus spending bill that makes such spoofing attempts from abroad a criminal act.

Meng, whose district covers a swath of the New York City borough of Queens, home to a large Asian-American population, called the law a “first step” in penalizing overseas con artists who try to scam people in the U.S. through spoofing.

The bill became law in March, right around the time her office began fielding reports about the Chinese consulate scam, which appeared mostly to be targeting people with Chinese-sounding surnames.

“These folks, they probably tend to trust the Chinese consulate, they’re speaking in their language,” Meng said. “It’s easier, I think, to scam people when they’re talking in their own language.”

Meng’s office said they’ve received a few dozen reports from constituents about the Chinese consulate scam, including one who said they lost $1.5 million. The congresswoman added that, for this particular scam, it appears that the number of phone calls in her district has dropped since springtime, when there was an onslaught of them.

The New York Police Department did not respond to requests for comment about the scam.

It’s unclear what effect the anti-spoofing bill has had so far on deterring or prosecuting scam-artists overseas since it was signed into law.

Apart from imposing criminal penalties, the legislation requires the Federal Communications Commission, together with the FTC, to regularly update materials to help consumers identify and protect themselves from caller-ID scams.

Meng also sent a letter to the FTC in May, calling for its online complaint assistant to be made available in Chinese. (The website has only a Spanish-language option.)

Dorman, the FTC spokesperson, said the agency doesn’t comment on correspondences it receives, but did reference online FTC literature in Chinese that informs consumers specifically about the consulate scam, scams against immigrants and wiring money overseas.

Back in Cambridge, authorities hadn’t seen too many instances of scammers pretending to be the Chinese government, said Warnick, the Cambridge Police Department spokesperson.

The woman targeted in June had corresponded with the fraudsters for around a week through voice and text, according to Warnick. They even asked her to get a temporary cell phone from which she could make international calls.

Over the week and using that phone, the scammers got the Cambridge woman to divulge more and more personal information, including her name, address, age and social security number, Warnick said.

They then plugged those details into what looked like a legitimate arrest warrant in simplified Chinese characters, which Warnick said they texted to her.

They told the woman they were in Cambridge and that if she didn’t proceed with a money transfer, they would arrest her and kick her out of the U.S., according to Warnick. After wiring the money, the woman searched online and found that her purported international arrest warrant was a document used in other scam attempts across the country.

She tried contacting police in Hong Kong, where she had transferred the money, but they weren’t able to help, according to Warnick. Then the woman called the Cambridge Police Department.

“She was frankly so embarrassed she didn’t even notify family or friends that she was a victim,” Warnick said, adding that the woman was not elderly, an age group that often falls prey to such scams.

Fortunately, she had at a few things going in her favor.

One was that the transfer took place over the weekend, when banks tend to be closed. Another was that a Cambridge Police Department detective just happened to be friends with an IRS agent stationed in Hong Kong, Warnick said.

The detective notified the IRS official about the transfer and its size, according to Warnick.

“That particular agent worked with local police to freeze the transfer before ultimately it was successfully submitted through the destination bank,” Warnick added.

In the end, the woman got back her $95,000, except for the $80 wire fee. The case has since been handed over to the FBI, Warnick said.

Not every victim is as lucky. Warnick said that in Cambridge, a city across the Charles river from Boston with 110,000 residents, police receive an average of 10 to 15 reported telephone internet scams each week.

“We believe that the magnitude of it is much higher because a lot of these aren’t reported,” Warnick added, citing such reasons as embarrassment.

A report released in January by AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for the aging, found that an overwhelming majority of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders age 50 and older said they or their families have been targets of fraud, while a third of all victims lost on average $15,000.

Meng said educating residents is most important in preventing people from becoming victims of scams, which are not just limited to impostors pretending to call from the Chinese consulate.

One of the more prevalent schemes includes thieves impersonating Internal Revenue Service personnel who disguise their phone numbers to make it seem like they’re calling from the IRS. They then demand immediate payment for unpaid taxes, according to Meng’s office.

Warnick said the non-emergency number of the Cambridge Police Department has even been spoofed.

So-called blessing schemes have also been used to prey on members of the Chinese community, especially the elderly. Fraudsters tell their victims that a death curse has been placed on them and that the only way to remove it is by forking over cash and jewelry.

Warnick, whose police department has nearly 280 officers who speak 14 languages, said they hold regular seminars for seniors in particular to help them understand the latest trends in scams and what to do to protect themselves.

But he added that it can be challenging trying to reach residents for whom English is a second language.

There is “somewhat of an intimidation factor in terms of contacting local police and working with local police, especially during these times of immigration concerns,” Warnick said.

“But certainly we as a department make ourselves available to go wherever people feel like they need support, whether it’s a community meeting, or with a small group, in a home, whatever it may be, we’ve done all of the above,” he said.

THE tactics used by scammers targetting elderly and vulnerable people in Oxfordshire have been revealed by police.

Following a Thames Valley alert warning issued on Friday about a fraudster calling people in Chipping Norton and pretending to be a police officer, the force has now said the scam has also seen victims called by a fake bank official.

To substantiate their claim, police said the caller is sometimes able to confirm easily-obtainable details about the victim such as their full name and address.

They may also offer a telephone number for the victim to call to check that they are genuine, but this number redirects to the fraudster who pretends to be a different person.

After some trust has been established, the scammer will then say money has been removed from a victim’s bank account and staff at their local bank branch are responsible.

Police added scammers may also say a business such as a jewellers or currency exchange is operating fraudulently and they require assistance to help secure evidence.

Victims are then asked to cooperate in an investigation by going to their bank and withdrawing money, withdrawing foreign currency from an exchange or purchasing an expensive item to hand over to a courier, who will also be a fraudster.

At the time of handover, unsuspecting victims are promised the money will be reimbursed but in reality there is no further contact and the money is never seen again.

Many of us have heard of phone scams targeting residents, but the latest one threatens to have local cops arrest you.

I sat down with a former assistant attorney general of Louisiana who wants to let the elderly know of this scam.

Col. Jeron J. La Fargue, retired Attorney at Law, says, "The main thing is unfortunately there are people in the world who will try to take advantage of senior citizens."

"This is the voicemail that elderly people in the area are receiving trying to extort money from them:”

"This is a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in the next 24 working hours and once again, if it expires, you will be taken under custody by the local cops."

"An elderly person who does not have my background would think that it's true that someone is going to come knock on their door, police and take them into custody," La Fargue says.

The Better Business Bureau says the number the scammers are calling from is not local.

Jenn Love, with the Better Business Bureau of Acadiana, says, "It's funny because they'll call from a non-local number and they'll say the local cops are coming but they won't say what parish or what city they're even living in it's just very generic that the local cops are coming."

"I'm not sure that they could arrest them because they're out of the country but the main thing is for people to understand that it is a scam," explains La Fargue.

"Some people think just because they have your name and they know their phone number that they have all this information, they'll volunteer it thinking they already have it and that's not the case. Don't give out any of your personal information," Love adds.

In order to avoid this threatening phone scam, here are some suggestions from the Better Business Bureau:
• None Don't give out any personal information, including your name, address, or especially your banking information.
• None Don't trust your caller ID. Scammers now have the technology to take the caller ID and distort it to any number.
• None Government agencies will not call you. They will send you a letter if they need to contact you.

The Social Security Administration issued a warning today about an ongoing Office of the Inspector General (OIG) impersonation scheme. The scheme echoes a pattern where thieves pretend to be from government agencies, like those involving scammers posing as callers from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In the most recent scam, folks are reporting suspicious phone calls allegedly from the OIG. Specifically, the caller identifies as “Gale Stone” and states the person’s Social Security number (SSN) is at risk of being deactivated or deleted. The scammers are hoping that name sounds familiar: the Acting Inspector General of Social Security is Gale Stallworth Stone. It's also worth noting that Social Security numbers don't have an expiration date, and you don't have to re-activate or confirm them for them to be valid.

While variations on the scam exist, typically the caller advises the victim to call a particular phone number to resolve the issue. Do not call the number or engage with the scammer (even if you think you can get the better of them). The better tack is just to hang up. You can also report the information to the OIG at 1.800.269.0271 or online.

Above all, the real Inspector General Stone urges you to be cautious and to avoid providing information such as your SSN or bank account numbers to unknown persons over the phone or internet unless you are sure who is asking.

The same rule applies to those alleged IRS phone calls. When in doubt, assume it’s a scam. If you’re not sure whether a call is legitimate, hang up and call back using an official number (don't just use the caller ID number on your phone since those can be spoofed). To reach IRS, call 1.800.829.1040. To contact Social Security, call 1.800.772.1213.

The IRS says that phone scams are still "a major threat to taxpayers." In early 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Remember that the IRS will never:
• Call to demand immediate payment over the phone, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.
• Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
• Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
• Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.
• Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

I was traveling recently when I got a phone call letting me know that the Internal Revenue Service apparently wants to throw me in jail.

If there is one thing you can hear while you're on the road that is worse than the thump of a flat tire or the clatter of an engine breakdown it's the voice of an IRS agent who is insisting you're going to do hard time.

And I was on the move, so you could say that from the moment I answered the call I was on the lam. I was fleeing the law. Since I was traveling on an Interstate, it was sort of a high-speed getaway. Great, not only did I need to make sure I was keeping to the speed limit in case I encountered a state trooper, now I had to keep an eye out for federal agents in official-looking cars accompanied by anyone who looked like an IRS accountant.

"There's the one! That's the guy whose numbers were obscured by coffee stains on his tax return ..."

In all honesty, I'm not sure if spilled java during late-night and last-minute tax filing work was included in my law-breaking. When the call came in I was driving in a rainstorm in a hands-free telephone state, so I listened to it for only a few seconds through the vehicle's audio hookup before hanging up on what appeared to be the recorded voice of a woman who seemed to be linguistically challenged in English. I understood what she said. Still, some of the grammar seemed to be a little bit off for someone chosen by the IRS to communicate with the public.

She said that I had four serious infractions and, essentially, the IRS was tracking me down. She didn't say what those infractions were, but the tone was accusatory. In fact, she told me that if I didn't call the IRS back I would be arrested by the local "cops."

It was then that I pressed the "hang up" button on my SUV's dashboard radio. I was approaching a tractor-trailer. Better that I be cuffed in the privacy of my home than be cut off by a truck driver who couldn't see me in his spray.

After ending the call, however, I wasn't very worried. The woman's charges seemed too unbelievable. I couldn't see how I could break four laws on one tax form. I don't earn that much. I didn't even itemize. I filed the short form. I didn't have room on one piece of paper — filling out both the front and back — to be too much of a criminal, even by accident.

Besides, I've read a lot in the last few years about IRS phone scams. Callers seek personal information or demand payments of unpaid taxes over the phone by using debit cards. The callers refuse to entertain questions about the required payments or incorrectly insist that the IRS allows no appeal of the alleged tax code violations. If a scamming victim protests, the callers threaten to bring in local law enforcement. But, I'm guessing real IRS agents wouldn't call those officers "cops."

And, later I went online to the IRS website and saw that these scams occur throughout the country. I know this to be a fact because a second call from the same number came in later in my drive and I was in a different state. This time I listened to it the whole way through. It's interesting what a guy will do for entertainment on a long drive.

The call sounded even more like a scam when I heard it in its entirety. I'm writing about it only as a warning to people who might fall victim to such a call, handing over money because four infractions seems serious.

Nevertheless, I warn you, on the slim chance that it wasn't a scam, and "cops" come to my door, you might be waiting a few years for the next column.

Criminals come up with some pretty sneaky ways to rip us off. You'd think eventually they would run out of ideas. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case.

There's no sign of them letting up anytime soon. Many times, crafty crooks will take a version of an old scam and tweak it just enough to make it seem new.

That's actually happening right now. A new twist on an old school phone scam is tricking people all across the country and costing victims tons of money.

A California police department put out a scam alert this week. It's warning everyone that criminals are calling people and pretending to be representatives from big box retailer Costco.

What's happening is that the caller offers you a $500 Costco Travel Credit or Costco Cash Card for just taking a brief survey. During the survey, you're asked for a bunch of personal information.

The problem is that they aren't actual Costco representatives. It's a scam.

If you fall for it and give out your information, the scammers use it to commit identity theft. And it's not just going around California, it's all across the U.S. The thieves are thought to be based in California, but are using spoofing technology that makes the incoming call look like it's from your city, no matter where you live in the country.

The first thing to do if you receive a scam phone call is report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This will help shut down any ongoing phone scams. You can call the FTC to report it at 1-877-382-4357. Keep reading for more ways to protect yourself.

This is actually the easiest solution to eliminating scam phone calls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them.

Many phone companies allow you to block calls that don't show a number on caller ID. Check with your provider to find out how to turn this feature on.

Note: if someone you actually know calls you and blocks their outgoing number, their call won't make it through if you've turned this feature on.

If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you will receive more calls in the future.

You can also download and install call blocking apps such as NomoRobo, True Caller or Hiya on your smartphone. Click here for more information about these types of apps.

Many phone scams begin with a robocall. Criminals use this technique to find new victims all the time.

Listen to Kim's free podcast on ways to outsmart robocallers

You’ve heard them -- the annoying robotic calls that try to scam you with free vacations or false threats from the IRS. In fact, it is estimated that scammers make 2.5 billion robocalls in one month alone. This poses a very real risk to consumers as it gets harder to identify and avoid malicious automated calls. In this Komando on Demand podcast, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family from falling victim to these tricky and downright dangerous phone calls.

Test your firewall to make sure it’s working

Your firewall is an essential tool that keeps hackers from seeing your computer online. Even if they know your computer's location and IP address, the firewall keeps them from accessing your network. But many don't know if they have a firewall or not, or if it's actually working. Here's a quick way to test your network to make sure you're protected.

Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig is warning residents to be wary of fraudulent, scam phone calls where the caller pretends to be from Costco Wholesale and offers a travel voucher, cash card or reduced travel package in exchange for your personal information.

This scam is targeting both members and non-members of Costco Wholesale where the fraudsters are attempting to collect personal information. The caller, pretending to work for Costco, offers either a $500 Costco travel credit or a Costco cash card as a reward for completing a survey.

These fraudsters are likely using software to show a local phone number on the caller ID while hiding the real phone number of where the calls are originating from. This tactic, called spoofing, tricks the resident into wanting to pick up the phone, thinking that the caller is located locally.

The personal information these fraudsters are trying to obtain can be used against you to commit identity theft in an effort to steal your money. Costco Wholesale has confirmed that these callers are in no way affiliated with Costco or Costco travel.

“Telephone scams have become more sophisticated than ever,” Reisig said. “Nobody is immune from being targeted by these persistent crooks and everyone could be affected by these calls. The best defense against becoming a victim of such a scam is knowledge and vigilance. It’s OK to say ‘no’ to these persistent crooks.”

More than 100 phone calls have flooded the Portage County Sheriff's Office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers. Victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested.

This is the latest scam hitting residents in Portage County where even the sheriff received one of those calls. "I actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up. I played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes I asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him? I said I am the local sheriff and he hung up," explained Sheriff Mike Lukas, Portage County Sheriff's Office.

The scammers use fake names and bogus IRS identification numbers and, in some cases, they may know a lot about who they are calling. Even the caller ID can appear to look like it is the IRS.

Jennifer Sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls. She got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year.

"Earlier this year I got a voicemail that I was going to be taken into custody and I thought 'oh my god what do I do?' but this one I was kind of taken like this isn't real. They were saying I was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name," said Sisley.

If you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information.

"Immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay. Those are definitely scams," said Sheriff Lukas.

"Just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it," said Sisley.

But experts say there is an easy solution to fix the phone “port-out” fraud, in which scammers steal a victim’s personal information and use it to switch their mobile number to another phone company.

Having control of the mobile number and the ability to intercept calls and messages, scammers then request a password reset of the person’s bank and email accounts using two-factor authentication where a text message is sent.

Sunshine Coast University Professor of Cybersecurity David Lacey said victims usually found out when their phone went to “SOS” mode.

He is also the managing director of IDCARE, which helps scam victims.

New figures show more than 1000 calls for help to IDCARE in the past year over port-out complaints and a spike in the last quarter.



Scammers often use phone or email scams or stolen mail to access personal information before making a port-out attempt.

“In some cases telcos send messages saying you are about to be ported but unfortunately when messages are sent porting is already taking place and won’t be stopped,” Mr Lacey said.

In most port-out scams, the criminal produces a licence number for verification, or a passport or Medicare number to telcos.

Once a victim’s bank account is accessed, money is normally transferred to another domestic account (fraudulently set up in another person’s name) and then offshore.

Mr Lacey said fraud could easily be reduced if mobile phone users were sent a yes/no port-out option.

Brisbane woman Georgina Gofton’s phone number was hijacked last week and her email was accessed.

“While we were on the phone to Telstra, I started receiving alerts on my email that it had been accessed and the password had been changed and they had used my phone number to get a verification code (to reset the password),” Ms Gofton said.

“There should be some more checks and balances in place.”

Ms Gofton said she was fortunate to not have her bank details in her email but scammers accessed personal information. She has since changed her number, deactivated the email account and changed other account passwords.

“It’s compromised other people’s information as well,” she said.

In another case, a Brisbane woman had her mail stolen before her phone was ported. Within minutes of the porting from Optus, more than $5000 was stolen from her bank account.

The phone company offered a six-month credit but she is yet to get her money back.

Financial and Cyber Crime squad Detective Sergeant Kris Steadman said 36 cases had been reported to the Queensland Police Service this year.

Port-out fraud had become more prominent with the introduction of two-factor authentication, he said.

“Generally porting of a mobile only occurs after an offender has accessed emails or obtained harvested credential,” Det Sgt Steadman said.

“The hacker/scammer may obtain bank login details from the compromised email, access the banking application and, as the phone number has been ported, they receive the two factor authentication message as opposed to the genuine subscriber.”

Federal Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said: “The telecommunications industry is working with financial institutions to put in place a range of new measures to improve customer security and reduce the incidence of fraud using access to mobile devices”.

A Telstra spokesman said customers who have received a port out request were sent an SMS before the port-out happens. An Optus spokeswoman said the company followed industry-agreed processes regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority to validate the porting of numbers.

SUNSET HILLS, MO - A common phone scam nearly costs a Sunset Hills couple thousands of dollars. But a quick-thinking local courier service stopped the crime from happening.

Nick Kirkou, owner of Ontime Express Courier and Delivery said he had a feeling, that the Monday morning call his dispatcher took from a guy about a package delivery didn’t sound right.

“When we looked up the address it comes up in the Bronx at an apartment building and it was supposed to be going to a business” Kirkou explained.

He said the man on the phone was calling from a Canadian area code.

The dispatcher followed orders and had a driver pick up the package from an address in Sunset Hills which was then to be delivered to FedEx. But the company’s suspicion got them to alert police.

“I went home and it was bothering me,” Kirkou went on to say, “and then I got a phone call from Sunset Hills Police Department asking if I could come up there and that the envelope was a scam.”

The envelope contained about $15,000 in cash belonging to a senior citizen couple.

The grandparents had fallen for what police commonly refer to as the ‘Grandparent Scam.’

“The victim received an urgent call from an individual purporting to be a public defender out of New York and gave them a long convoluted story about their grandson being involved in an accident,” explained Sergeant Robbie Hagen.

Hagen said the couple explained that they even talked with someone who sounded like their grandson claiming he needs a substantial amount of money.

It turned out that the couple has a grandson who lives in New York.

“People don’t realize how much information is out there on the internet about all of us and what information these people are able to glean about our ages and who we are associated with and our family members,” said Hagen.

“You’ve gotta watch out for your neighbors and your family,” said Kirkou, “as a business, we have that moral obligation too and we are in the business to make money but that’s not the way we want to earn it.”

Police said that these scams are becoming more and more common and can happen to anyone.

The number of phone scams is on the rise, police say.

They are warning people of a new scam where the caller claims to be from the police and Spark and tries to access victims' computers and bank accounts.

Detective sergeant Damian Rapira-Davies said the scammer told victims their computer had been illegally accessed or used for criminal purposes.

The call is then transferred to someone claiming to be from the Organised and Financial Crime Agency (OFCANZ) arm of the police, who gives instructions on how to allow them access to the victim's device.

"Whether the scammer purports to be from the Department of Immigration or the Chinese Embassy or one of dozens and dozens of stories that are used, each story is designed to create anxiety for the person who answers the phone," Mr Rapira-Davies said.

He said OFCANZ had been renamed and was no longer used within the police.

Mr Rapira-Davies said often older and more vulnerable members of the community were the ones who were targeted.

"We have certainly tried to do a lot of work to try and advise the public [of scams]," he said.

Mr Rapira-Davies said anyone who was a victim of a scam, whether through the phone or online, should immediately report the scam to their bank and the police.

"That money may not have left the country, it may be still in transit, it may be able to be frozen and reversed so [the bank] is the first port of call if someone has been scammed."

A shopkeeper whose failing business was destroyed in an explosion, killing five people, told an inmate in jail that he expected a larger insurance payout if lives were lost - a murder trial was told.

It was claimed that Aram Kurd, who ran Zabka supermarket in Hinckley Road, knew that members of the Ragoobeer family, who lived in the upstairs two-storey flat, would be at home when petrol was used to ignite a fire in the basement below the shop, on the evening of Sunday February 25.

Kurd allegedly told the inmate that the girlfriend of an alleged accomplice was left to die in the blast because he did not want to share the payout from the insurance scam with her.

He was expecting up to £300,000 to cover loss of stock and trading, say the prosecution.

Kurd and his two friends, Arkan Ali and Hawker Hassan all deny five counts of murder or manslaughter.

Thsoe who died were Mary Ragoobeer, 46, along with sons Sean Ragoobeer, 17, Shane Ragoobeer, 18, and Shane's girlfriend, Leah Beth Reek, 18.

Ali's girlfriend, Viktorija Ijevleva, 22, who was in the shop at the time, was also killed in the blast.

The three defendants deny conspiring together, and with Miss Ijevleva, to commit insurance fraud.

On the third day of his prosecution opening at Leicester Crown Court, David Herbert QC told the jury about Kurd's alleged "confession" to the inmate in March, when he was on remand in custody.

Mr Herbert alleged that Kurd had deliberately planned the fire.

He told an inmate he "cut himself" after the blast to make himself look more like a victim.

Kurd gave details to the inmate "in what amounts to a confession" when asking for advice on how to "get away" with it, claimed Mr Herbert.

What did Kurd allegedly tell the inmate?

He said: "Aram Kurd told him about his involvement in starting the fire.

"Some of those details can only be known to someone who was involved in the explosion.

"The motive, he told (the inmate), was an insurance scam because the shop wasn't doing well.

"He said he and Arkan Ali hatched the plan to set fire to the shop."

Kurd allegedly told the inmate that Ali and Miss Ijevleva purchased the insurance on his behalf for £1,200.

Mr Herbert claimed Kurd also confided that: "Prior to the explosion he moved a neighbour's CCTV camera to avoid being caught moving petrol to the basement.

"The preparation for this happened the day before.

"None of this was reported in the press, so how could (the inmate) have known about those details.

Mr Herbert continued: "Kurd went to the shop, and returned to distract Viktorija using Viktorija's phone to keep in contact with Arkan Ali so that Ali could give him a signal when the fire was being lit.

"Once he had the signal he used an excuse that he was going to get beer (from a stockroom).

"Other liquids were used along with petrol to make the fire more intense.

"He decided to use the basement because there were gas pipes there."

Mr Herbert said the gas pipes in the property had been capped off and gas played no part.

He said: "He (Kurd) remained at the scene and cut himself to make himself look more like a victim.

"Viktorija wasn't meant to survive because she knew about the insurance and he didn't want to split the money.

"He thought he might get a larger payout if people had died."

Mr Herbert also said: "It's clear he (Kurd) knew they (the Ragoobeer family) were going to be in the flat at the relevant time.

"He stated (to the inmate) he had made a mistake by not disposing of Viktorija's phone afterwards.

"He was worried about the connection to that phone (on a call to Ali's phone) at the time of the explosion.

"He told (the inmate) he was going to say he found it post-explosion and had used it as a torch - that was the explanation he gave even to the press, that he'd picked it up and used it as a torch."

Mr Herbert alleged that some time after speaking to the inmate Kurd asked him to disregard what he had said earlier, claiming there was "insufficient evidence" against him and the inmate should dispose of any notes as he was intending to to deny the charge and hoped to "get away with it."

The prosecutor added: "He (Kurd) may have spoken to his co-defendants by then.

"He was saying he hoped to escape prosecution."

Mr Herbert said that shop owner, Aram Kurd, in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, was seen crouching down in the rear yard of Zabka supermarket, before climbing over a wall into the alleyway of the neighbouring property, TJ's takeaway.

CCTV footage from the rear of TJ's was shown in court, capturing the explosion and debris flying everywhere.

A video clip showed Kurd crouching down and when fire broke out he went over the wall and entered nearby Carlisle Street.

An image of Kurd on the pavement was shown. He appeared to be bleeding from his head.

Mr Herbert said: "The reality is that he was either very very lucky indeed or his involvement in the crime was he knew where not to be at the crucial time, ie not in the shop above the basement.

"It was all an act. He appeared upset. He was bleeding from a small cut.

"He pretended from the outset to be the innocent victim.

"He said he was with a member of staff who gave him her phone to watch a video and he went to the back of the shop to watch the video.

"He said he was at the back of the shop, at the back of the building, when it exploded."

Mr Herbert claimed Kurd said he had landed on the floor and had a cut on the back of his head.

Kurd was attended by paramedics and treated at hospital.

He allegedly falsely told the police that a person called Viktorija (who died in the shop) began working at his store for the first time that day but he did not know her surname or any details about her.

Mr Herbert said: "Preparation began at least a day before the explosion.

"It was a plan to completely destroy the shop so it wouldn't be used again.

"The quantity of petrol showed they intended to cause maximum damage to the basement and the shop - and that's where Viktorija Ijevleva was.

"Why wasn't Viktorija warned? If she had been warned she wouldn't have waited, she would have left as Ali did.

"It was their intention she wouldn't survive."

Mr Herbert said that Kurd told "an obvious lie" about not knowing Viktorija Ijevleva "because he'd known her for weeks if not months."

The prosecutor alleged: "She was there because of her involvement with the defendants surrounding the insurance claim (relating to a fire at the shop).

"She was helping out because she was Arkan Ali's partner."

Mr Herbert said Kurd lied about his association with Viktorija "To hide his involvement in the conspiracy to defraud the insurance and the fire."

Mr Herbert said: "The search and rescue operation had to be delayed because of the fire.

He said that after two survivors, 15-year-old Scotty Ragoobeer, who had been in the flat, and a passer-by, Thomas Lindop, were saved from the wreckage: "It was two hours before rescue attempts could continue."

He said the remains of the five deceased were recovered in the early hours of Monday February 26..

Mr Herbert said Miss Ijevleva was found towards the front of the shop "where she would have been in vicinity of the counter."

Mr Herbert said a post mortem examination revealed the deceased "were severely affected by the effects of fire."

He said: "They died from inhalation of smoke and or severe burning."

Pathologist Michael Biggs later confirmed that to the jury, regarding the four people in the flat.

Miss Ijevleva's body sustained multiple fractures from falling masonry and she died from injuries caused by "crushed asphixia."

Cause of the explosion

Mr Herbert said: "The explosion had been caused by petrol; there was a distinct smell of it at the scene."

He said it was inconsistent with a gas explosion and the supply in both the shop and basement had previously been "capped off" in any event.

The prosecutor said: "The investigation was very complicated because two upper storeys had collapsed.

"The scene was very chaotic.

"Investigators found clear evidence of petrol in the debris.

"There was found to be distribution of petrol in multiple places; it simply couldn't have been caused by accidental spillage.

"Petrol was spread around the basement."

He said three petrol cans were recovered along with containers of white spirit and BBQ lighter fuel.

"Petrol is highly flammable; it's the vapour that causes the explosion," said Mr Herbert.

Mr Herbert said: "Ignition of the vapour caused the explosion in this case.

"The end result when the petrol vapour in the air is of the right concentraion."

The jury was told the fire developed in part of the basement prior to the explosion and there was "a strong smell of petrol" in the basement."

Petrol cans recovered were sized 25 litres, 20 litres and five litres.

There were two one-litre bottles of BBQ lighter fuel and two bottles of white spirit.

Mr Herbert said: "A mixture of BBQ lighter fuel and petrol was used to try and make the accelerant more potent."

He said the same mixture was found in debris from the building.

The prosecutor added: "The same mixture was found in swabs taken from outside.

"This shop didn't sell BBQ and lighter fuel so what was it doing there?

"A considerable amount of petrol must have been used in the basement given that it was so detectable to the nose after the fire.

"Just one of them (cans of fuel) could have been more than enough to cause the fire; this demonstrates the real intention these defendants must have had.

"We suggest it was a wicked intent."

Mr Herbert said the mixture of fuel would have formed "a potent flammable consistency for a prolonged fire."

He said: "It would have burned harder and for even longer.

"On any view it was a most determined attempt to destroy the building."

The prosecutor said: "What happened, essentially, was the force of the explosion caused the ground level shop floor to collapse."

He said that experts referred to such as situation as "a pancake collapse."

Mr Herbert added: "There was no supporting structure and everything comes down - and that's exactly what happened."

Mr Herbert suggested there were two possible methods of igniting the fire.

He added: "The prosecution say it was a malicious ignition."

The first alleged method was deliberately setting it alight with an improvised taper thrown inside the basement from outside.

The second suggestion was that combustible materials in the first basement room were deliberately lit and left until there was an explosive mix of petrol vapour.

Soot on bricks from the basement ceiling allegedly showed evidence of a pre-existing fire.

Mr Herbert said that by 7.30pm the mobile phones of Ali and Hassan indicated they had returned to Coventry.

By 9.15pm Ali was using another phone number.

There was no contact from Ali with his partner, Miss Ijevleva's phone.

Hassan's phone had attempted to connect with Kurd's phone.

Mr Herbert said the shop owner, Aram Kurd, was seen by the police and treated as a "significant witness."

He gave an hour long video recorded police statement and Mr Herbert said that although Kurd did not speak perfect English it was adequate.

Mr Herbert said: "He set out the details of what happened at the time of the explosion; that he was at the back of the shop and the reasons for him being there and so on.

"He said several things that were instructive, because they're lies.

"These were deliberate lies fashioned by time to try and conceal the truth of his deliberate involvement.

"He said 'Viktorija only come into my shop the day before yesterday, I don't know her full name or her age, I'd say she was young, about 20 or 21, a normal and a pretty girl.' "

Kurd maintained Viktorija did not say where she was living and did not tell him anything about herself.

He said she knew how to serve in the shop so everything was okay and on Sunday 25, the day of the explosion, she had started work at 2pm intending to stay to 10pm.

Kurd told the police he had her phone number stored in his phone, but added: "I can't provide any further information about Viktorija."

Mr Herbert told the jury: "He'd known her for months, more importantly, he was friends with her boyfriend (and co-accused), Arkan Ali, and he knew they lived in Coventry.

"She had been about to start a good job in Coventry the next day.

"He (Kurd) had been in regular contact with her and had messaged her and there was no mention of that and, importantly, there was no mention of Hassan or Ali.

"Why is that?

"The prosecution say it's obvious; he didn't want the police to find out she'd been involved in the insurance fraud (relating to the alleged planned shop fire) or that she'd been there when Hassan was buying petrol - she was part of the plot.

"He lied to conceal they planned to destroy this building all along.

"His lies are a consistent theme in this case.

"He went on to lie when he spoke to the BBC and ITV news about the ordeal he had suffered."

A BBC news clip was shown of Kurd speaking with a reporter on his doorstep.

He told the reporter: "I was at the shop, myself and Viktorija.

"We were watching a video on YouTube.

"I said I would get some beer, I went to the store room with her phone in my h and; my phone was on charger.

"I just heard a big bang, I didn't know what was that.

"I found myself on the floor, looking up, half my body was under bricks and rubble, I stayed there two or three minutes.

"My eyes were open but I couldn't breathe.

"I could see everywhere fire."

Clutching his chest, Kurd said: "Thank God from my heart, I was lucky.

"I just stand up, I see a light on the phone, I cannot open it - there was a password - just looking where I am.

"I go to the back, I got out of the back and I jumped out (over a wall).

"I go out and sit down and people came round."

When asked about Viktorija's whereabouts, he said: "I don't know, I don't have any idea, I have no information about that."

When asked about the other people missing from the flat he said there was a family and the father was a "good neighbour" who had occasionally been to his shop as a customer."

Mr Herbert said that on Tuesday February 27, two days after the explosion, the police visited Miss Ijevleva's mother and step-father at an address in Leicester.

He said they had another phone number for Arkan Ali for contact to be made.

Ali allegedly told officers he had been in a relationship with Miss Ijevleva for five years.

Ali claimed he travelled to Leicester with Miss Ijevleva on February 25 to drop her off at work at the Zabka store at 1.30pm because she was "looking for work."

Mr Herbert said: "The prosecution suggest it was a lie; the same lie told by Kurd.

"Arkan Ali said that was the reason for going to Leicester, so she could go to the shop to look for work and he'd collect her afterwards.

"That was a provable lie because she was due to start a new job (elsewhere) the next day."

Kurd, of Hillary Place, Braunstone, Leicester, Ali, of Drake Close, Oldham, and Hassan, formerly of Eld Road, Coventry, and also East Anglia, were all arrested on Wednesday February 28.

Kurd, 33, was apprehended in Leicester, Ali, 37, in Coventry and Hassan, 32, in Oldham.

Mr Herbert said that by this stage Kurd's position changed from being a significant witness to that of suspect.

In interview, Hassan was asked about petrol he bought in a canister from a petrol station, prior to the explosion.

He allegedly claimed he obtained 20 litres of petrol so he could drive to Oldham, but later said it was for another car for Miss Ijevleva.

When asked about footage of him unloading things into the shop, he said it was "goods" for the shop.

Mr Herbert said: "On the day of the explosion he agreed he and Arkan Ali had dropped Viktorija off in Leicester and gone into town."

He denied hearing an explosion before driving from Leicester to Coventry, it was claimed.

Hassan told officers the next day, on Monday February 26, Kurd, told him the shop had been on fire and denied having any involvement in the blaze.

Kurd, in interview, said he was friends with Arkan Ali and accepted knowing Miss Ijevleva.

He could not explain why he previously lied to the police, by claiming he met her for the first time on Saturday February 24, the day before the explosion, when he claimed she arrived looking for work.

Mr Herbert said Kurd accepted that Miss Ijevleva had assisted in arranging insurance for his shop business.

Kurd told officers he and Miss Ijevleva were watching videos and he went to fetch some beer.

When he took her phone to the store room at the back he claimed he was not in phone contact with Ali at that stage and suggested an earlier call between Miss Ijevieva's and Ali must have still been connected.

Kurd claimed he had never seen petrol in the shop or basement.

He then answered "no comment" to further questions.

Arkan Ali gave a "no comment" police interview, following his arrest, the court was told.

Australians are being targeted with scam phone calls from foreign countries which encourage you to ring the number back before charging you extortionate fees.

A dramatic increase in the 'wangiri' scam - which translates from Japanese as 'ring and cut' - was first flagged by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in February.

The 'wangiri' scam consists of an international number calling you, ringing once and then hanging up the phone.

If the call is returned, the scammers will try to keep you on the phone for as long as possible by playing music, reading a horoscope or simply putting you on hold.

According to the ACCC's ScamWatch, Australians have lost more than $48,000 to the calls in the last year - which are charged at a premium rate.

Social media users in Australia over the weekend complained in particular about receiving calls from Latvia - often several times a day.

One user said: 'I just got a call from someone in Latvia. Problem is I don't know anyone in Latvia.

Another added: 'Six phone calls from Latvia in 24 hours now. Someone is really keen for a chat, or this scam is very well funded.'

One tweeted at their network provider Telstra to ask why they had received so many calls from the Eastern European country.

According to SBS, the ACCC warned in February that migrants were most likely to get scammed.

Deputy chief Delia Rickard said: 'If you know people in the country they're calling from particularly if it's your home country and you've got family there - you're going to be more at risk.'

The federal government has released some tips to help people falling prey to these scammers.

They advise that you should not call the number back if you don't recognise it and if they call you repeatedly to block the number.

The government suggests blocking international calls from children's phones to stop them becoming victims as well.

Another tip is to deal with interactions from unknown people via phone, tax or internet as a scam.

The ACCC announced in May that Australians had lost more money to scammers in 2017 than in any other year since the commission began reporting scam activity.

"My daughter-in-law was sitting there and I said do you think this could be a scam? And she said I doubt it Dad because they are not asking for anything,” Barks said. “All he asked me to really do was read the codes back to him that he sent us and to verify my first name."

Here's how to (try to) block them so they stop interrupting your grind.

You’re not just imagining it: You're getting more robocalls.

Next year, almost half of all calls to cell phones will not be business calls or check-ins from loved ones, but scam calls. That grim forecast is according to First Orion, a company that makes caller ID and call-blocking software.

In 2017, First Orion estimated that about 3.7 percent of all calls to mobile numbers were spam. Today, they make up about 29 percent, but by early 2019, the company projects that proportion will skyrocket to 45 percent.

Some of the numbers for those incoming calls probably look eerily like your own phone number. (For me, the first six digits are often the same as mine.) That’s to trick you into thinking the call might be coming from someone who lives near you, whom you might know. If you’re like me, you’ve wisened up to this trick, dubbed “neighborhood spoofing,” and decline each call.

But for those who are fooled and answer, only to realize it’s the same pesky automated call from the same familiar-looking number again, there are tools out there to block these spammy scams, one number at a time.

The deluge of unwanted calls disrupts our busy days. As a reporter, I’ve more than once had my audio recording of an in-progress interview paused by an incoming call. Worse, they target individuals based on demographics, with attempts to convince immigrants they’re in legal trouble or fraudulently persuade people to wire them money, posing as utility companies, charities and more.

More than half of all complaints the U.S. Federal Communications Commission receives pertain to unwanted calls, The Washington Post reports.

There are several ways to combat this onslaught, but be aware that the perpetrators of scams are savvy, and have found workarounds to number blocking and other measures individuals can take. For one, they don’t honor the “Do Not Call” list many households are on to thwart telemarketers. First Orion is in the process of developing new “CallPrinting” technology, which it plans to implement through a major U.S. mobile carrier. Already, T-Mobile provides its subscribers with “Scam Likely” caller ID messages.

As Entrepreneur described in a piece on banishing distractions earlier this year, an iPhone user can tap the blue circled “i” symbol next to the number in their recent calls list and select “Block this Caller.” Android users can hold down the number in their recent calls list, then select block. That is, until the next scam call comes in from a different number.

Check out Entrepreneur’s Guide to Reducing Unneeded Distractions and Time-Sucks so You Can Be More Productive for more tips on blocking robocalls and managing other types of interruptions.

Scammers are flooding the United States with Chinese-language robocalls, causing major headaches from coast to coast.

These new robocalls are a lot like the ones you’ve already gotten on your phone at all hours of the day and night: Your phone rings, you pick up, and after a brief pause or maybe a quiet click or beep, a prerecorded voice message meets your ears. The recording, which often sounds like a young woman, usually delivers a message about lowering credit-card rates or buying into cheap health insurance.

If you fall for the bait, you’re transferred to a live human who will try anything to get you to hand over your credit-card or bank account info.

The important thing to remember is that sales robocalls are illegal in the United States. So, don’t expect the person on the other end of the line to follow through on whatever deal they claim to offer. You’re much more likely to fall victim to an identity theft scam or credit-card fraud than to score a deal from one of these spam callers.

The new Chinese-language version of these calls targets immigrants. The robocalls deliver a recorded message claiming to be from the Chinese consulate, saying the recipient is in trouble with Chinese officials, or sometimes that a package is waiting at the Chinese consulate that needs to be picked up.

Then, the robocall asks for a deposit or fee, demanding a credit-card number or bank information. Sometimes the robocall or live operator who follows it makes a threat, suggesting that more trouble will come if the person doesn’t willingly hand over their financial info, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

In New York City alone, police estimate at least 30 residents had been scammed out of $3 million, according to National Public Radio.

The Chinese Consulate General in New York says it has posted dozens of alerts on its website warning about the scams. "We would like to restate that the Consulate General in New York would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Consulate General would not ask for bank account information," it warned.

The scammers are also upping the ante with a tech trick called “spoofing.” Spoofed calls can fake caller ID numbers, making them look like they’re coming from a familiar number, nearby area code, your hometown or in this case, the Chinese consulate, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which also issued an alert.

So, even if you don't speak Chinese, why would you get so many calls? The scammers don’t know who they’re calling, and it costs virtually nothing to place a phone call, so if they hit a few thousand English-speaking phones for every one Chinese speaker that’s totally fine with them.

This scam uses many of the same ploys used on unsuspecting English speakers, say in the scam where the caller pretends to be from the IRS and is demanding payments on back taxes that don’t really exist.

What to do:
•Never give money to any caller demanding it: If you speak Chinese and receive one of these threatening calls, never hand over your bank or credit card information, no matter how scary the recorded message might sound. Nobody – including the Chinese consulate, the IRS and immigration officials – will ever call you out of the blue to demand money, and they certainly won’t pepper your phone with robocalls.
•Block numbers that hit you with repeated robocalls: If one specific number has been giving you a headache, you can block the number manually from your iPhone or Android smartphone. On the iPhone, click the little “i” next to the number on your recent calls list and then tap “Block This Caller.” On Android 6.0 or later you can find the number on your call history, tap it, then tap “Block.”
•Use an app: Apps such as Nomorobo, Robokiller and YouMail, to name just a few, really can help curb robocalls. I use them, and they’ve successfully thwarted thousands of spam calls to my cellphone. Many of the apps are free for at least a week, then cost around $2 a month or nearly $20 a year after that. (The apps present this to you as “upgrades” or “premium.”)
•Sign up for the federal Do Not Call list: The Do Not Call list is still your best bet for avoiding robocalls of all kinds, and that includes this new Chinese variant. I spoke with the FTC about the Do Not Call list and the many conspiracy theories that signing up for the list puts you at a greater risk of phone spam.

According to the FTC, getting access to the Do Not Call list not only requires valid sign-up information (you can’t just request access to it anonymously) as well as an access fee. These are factors that push away scammers, and the FTC says it has never had to bring a robocall case against any company or group which has access to that list.

You might feel like robocalls are a never-ending disease, but the FTC already has had some huge wins in stemming the rising tide. The commission regularly hosts expos and forums to find new ways to stop the pesky calls and wages pricey lawsuits against telemarketers it catches using them. As recently as June the FTC nailed robocall operations that it says had made billions of robocalls.

WASHINGTON COUNTY -- If you got a call from someone claiming they work for the Washington County Sheriff's Office, you're not alone.

Washington County officials are warning residents across southeast Wisconsin of a potential phone scam claiming that you have a civil case open against you or there's an active warrant out for your arrest.
• More Millennials Lose Money In Scams Than Elderly, New Data Shows

The scammers are identifying themselves as actual officers and using the names from their office's directory. Some of the callers have asked residents to purchase gift cards as well.

In a press release, Washington County officials say that they rarely make phone calls regarding these issues or advise people to go buy gift cards.

If you do receive a call from someone claiming to be an officer, you're encouraged to call the Washington County Sheriff's Office at (262)335-4478.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The spam calls keep coming, but this one leaves a voicemail and it sounds like you should call them back.

The call, however, could cost you, CBS2’s Clark Fouraker reported Thursday.

The call comes from a 10-digit number that looks domestic, but beware of area codes 809, which is in the Dominican Republic, 284, the British Virgin Islands, and 876, Jamaica.

“You’re actually dialing internationally, and international rates apply. You can pay normal rates if you’re calling a friend or family member, but there are also services called ‘premium services,'” said John Breyault of the National Consumers League.

Those services could be lines dedicated to gambling or psychic readings. A new email warning says they leave a message that says, “Hey this is Karen. Sorry I missed you. Get back to us quickly. I have something important to tell you.”

“It’s very sad, and it’s so many scams,” said Hope Chasin of the East Village.

“It’s outrageous, of course, and AT&T or Verizon should block those calls and I’m sure they’re able to do it if they want,” Midtown resident David Pagar added.

The scams keep happening because the cost for scammers is so low. They can spam thousands of phones for next to nothing, and if just one person falls for the trick the scammers often walk away with a profit, Fouraker reported.

“Because of relationships they have with the phone company or the operator of that premium line get a kickback,” Breyault said.

That happens because the domestic and international phone company have paid each other for facilitating the international call. By the time you get your bill, you’re the only one who hasn’t paid.

“I tend to not call back any number that I don’t know that haven’t left a message just because of scammers,” Long Island resident William MacCloud said. “People trying to charge me on my cellphone.”

The scammers bet on a small charge between $10-$30 not catching your attention. Experts say if you notice a charge on your bill to call your phone company and ask for the charge to be removed.

If the phone company won’t drop the charge, experts say to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.

Public warned not to answer phone calls from 'Wangiri' scam

Irish people have been targeted by a phone scam this week as fraudsters attempt to extract money from unsuspecting members of the public.

The scam - known as 'Wangiri fraud' - involves an unknown number calling your phone and leaving you with a missed call. When people call the number back, their phone credit is drained or a hefty charge is added to their phone bill.

Scams like this do the rounds every so often but the public are being warned not to be caught out by this latest one.

The calls are reported to be from Somalia and have a 00252 prefix.

The following advice should always be followed:
• Avoid answering calls from numbers that you cannot identify, especially if you are not expecting a call.
• Hang up immediately, on calls where there appears to be no recipient on the other end.
• Be wary of multiple calls being received from the same number.
• Do not call back any number that leaves you a blank voicemail message.
• Do not provide any personal information for example – banking details/PPS number/credit card details/name and address/passport number etc.
###########################################################################################
Most of the time when our phone rings we know who is on the other end. It may be a family member or possibly a friend and, if not either of those, likely some business or other contact we were expecting to hear from.

There are of course robocalls, which none of us like, but those are pretty easy to identify and hang up on. But what if you answered and the message was in Mandarin and it said to be from the Chinese consulate?

If you understand the language you might be a bit more inclined to pay attention, so when the voice says you need to take some steps in order to avoid any kind of trouble with the government, you might listen.

Unfortunately, it's all a scam

Like many attacks of this nature, they prey on people being confused or scared. Specifically, this scam tends to involve the call saying the consulate has an important document that needs to be retrieved, though it could also ask the person to provide information in order to avoid any kind of issue with the consulate.

Whatever the case, before the victim realizes what's going on, they have often wired a good amount of money to a Chinese bank.

A spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission told NBC News that there is no way to estimate this scam's scope, but reports have come in from all over the country. That led the Chinese embassy in the United States to provide an alert on its official website trying to help warn people about the scam, which it released back in April.

In part, it said:

"We would like to restate that the Embassy and Consulates General of China would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Embassy would not ask for bank account information."

Why is this one so effective?

Of course this scam, like most of its kind, takes advantage of people. But part of why it works is that the scammers use spoofing in order to make it appear as though their call is coming from a legitimate number, such as the Chinese consulate.

Add the fact that the call and message are in the Chinese language, and it's understandable why some would believe it to be legitimate.

One woman, who NBC News mentioned, ended up providing personal information including a name, address, age and Social Security number. With those details in hand, the scammers created what looked like a real arrest warrant, and they told the woman they would arrest her and remove her from the United States if she did not wire the money.

Only after sending the money did she look online and find out that the alleged arrest warrant was actually a document used in other scam attempts. She attempted to contact police in Hong Kong, which is where the money went, but they were unable to help.

However, through a little bit of luck, the transfer was frozen before it was submitted through the destination bank. She was able to recover the $95,000 she would have lost, save for the $80 wire fee.

Not everyone is as fortunate, so here's how to not become a victim

This specific scam targets people in the Chinese community, and in fact, the AARP reported in January that a great majority of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders age 50 and older said their families had been targets of fraud. Along those lines, one-third of all victims lost an average of $15,000.

But while this scam targets a certain community, in truth the methods to avoid it and others are very similar. It is important to understand that legitimate organizations, and especially governments, do not ask for sensitive information over the phone, nor would they require you wire money in order to settle an issue.

If you do receive one of the calls, it is a good idea to take a moment and do some research into it. If it is fake, chances are it will not take long to discover.

What to do if you've been scammed

When you realize you've been scammed out of money, there's no time to waste.

Contact the bank you used and see if it can stop the transaction. If you've purchased gift cards -- another favorite of scammers -- contact the company that issues the cards to see what they can do. You should also contact law enforcement -- local police or even the FBI -- if only to file a report that you might need later to make a claim.

More ways to stop phone call scams in their tracks

Ask your phone service provider if it offers a robocall blocking service. If not, encourage your provider to offer one. You can also visit the FCC's website for information and resources on available robocall blocking tools to help reduce unwanted calls. (Click here to learn how to block specific phone numbers.)

Many phone companies allow you to block calls that don't show a number on caller ID. Check with your provider to find out how to turn this feature on. Note: If someone you actually know calls you and blocks their outgoing number, their call won't make it through if you've turned this feature on.

This is actually the easiest solution to eliminating robocalls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them.

4. Subscribe to the Do Not Call Registry

This move will stop many robocalls before they begin. If you're on the registry, it's illegal for many robocallers to call you. Tap or click here to get your number into the National Do Not Call Registry. After your number is on the registry for 31 days, you can report unwanted sales calls.

If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you will receive more calls in the future.

You can also download and install call blocking apps such as NomoRobo, True Caller or Hiya on your smartphone. Tap or click here for more information about these types of apps.

New Zealanders are still being targeted by mysterious calls from international numbers as part of an elaborate scam that has been running over the last few years.

Dubbed the "Wangiri" scam, which translates from the Japanese to "one ring and cut", it involves con artists leaving missed calls on the user's phone from an unknown international number. Should the user call back, they are charged premium rates of up to $50 a minute.

This is not the first time such scam hit New Zealanders. As recently as February last year, there were reports of similar scams.

"The Wangiri call is when a scammer will call from a premium number and purposely hang up after one or two rings," she told the Herald.

"Because calls are billed typically from the time of answer, these attempts have no cost to the attacker. They will typically target mobile phones, as there is a higher likelihood that a mobile phone has caller ID display.

''The goal for the attacker is to entice victims to call back the number upon seeing a missed call. The perpetrators make money by collecting revenue on these calls via the premium rates issued by the overseas telecommunications provider, or by scamming victims on the return calls."

Arauzo draws a distinction between wangiri ruse and the increasingly common robo dialler scams, which are also present in New Zealand.

"The auto-dialler system enables the caller to systematically auto dial a list of numbers. If it picks up human activity on the other end it can either connect you to a person, or if there isn't someone available, it will be silent and then hang up."

While Arauzo said Spark customers "don't appear to be reporting a surge of this type of scam activity," she did say the telco is always vigilant in keeping an eye on these issues.

"Spark plays an active role in limiting the number of scam calls out there. When a scammer uses one number continuously, we identify and block that number."

The same also applies Vodafone, whose spokesperson Elissa Downey says they're also keeping an eye on scam activity.

"Unfortunately the 'wangiri' scam hits our shores from time to time, but we are not seeing a surge in this type of scam at the moment," said Downey.

"Our best advice is to avoid answering those numbers or any number you don't recognise or expect a call from and let the call go to voicemail. That way you can check if the message is from someone you were expecting or actually want to hear from. If the caller does not leave a message, ignore it and don't call the number back."

Beyond the missed call variation of the "wangiri" scam, Downey also recommends keeping an eye out for other scams.

"Another one to watch out for is an unsolicited call and someone starts engaging with you," Downey told the Herald.

"Typically, with this type of scam they are calling from overseas but sometimes they might spoof a New Zealand number, fixed or mobile, and they either try to sell you something or ask you for money."

Downey recommends users treat the interactions exactly the same as they would an unsolicited email.

"Simply hang up and don't engage," she said.

"It is really important to always be on your guard with callers you don't know – if something seems a bit off or too good to be true, it usually is."

She also advises mobile users to notify their telco immediately if they have received a strange call or large charge.

"We work with the wider telco industry to block certain numbers from connecting through to customers phones if we know they are linked to a scam."

Downey finally recommends that users check the Consumer Protection website if they're in any doubt about whether something might be a scam.

You've probably received a scam phone call in the past, but recently some people are getting calls in Mandarin.

Groups who work with newcomers are warning about phone calls that appear to be trying to scam people and get your personal information.

The voice speaks in Mandarin, either live or recorded, and says there is a package to be picked up and asks for personal information.

The P.E.I. Association for Newcomers to Canada said it's heard from people in the community who have received phone calls, and even their staff have gotten calls.

'No, that's definitely a scam'

"I received that call too and it's basically asking me, like, you have important packages. If you want to retrieve it, please dial 9 to get more information," said Nicole Li, who is a settlement worker with the association.

"But like no, that's definitely a scam so I just hung up. So later on in the day, I also heard from other people from the community about the same messages that they received," she said.

Ally Guo, owner of a local publication that helps newcomers navigate the Island, www.GiGiGu.com, posted a warning to people on their website and social media.

She's heard from 50 people who have had similar calls.

"Actually I received a call myself. I received the call and then I have to tell my friends not to be cheated by this kind of call. That's why I spread the news out," Guo said.

Guo said there are 3,000 people following the publication's online accounts and she wanted them to hear about the calls in case they might receive one.

P.E.I. RCMP said if you get a call asking for personal information, making threats for payment or any other obvious scam, you should just hang up.

Island RCMP said if you haven't experienced a loss, there is no need to make a report to them.

Police say most of these calls are made by automated dialers that could target hundreds of people a day, and if everyone notified police, they would be overwhelmed.

Fraud attempts can be reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. You can also check out their website to keep up with the latest scams that are being attempted.

If you’ve received a phone call from someone claiming to be with EPCOR, asking for immediate cash payments, the power company is warning customers to be cautious.

The company has recently received complaints from customers about suspicious phone calls, in which the caller on the other end claims to be from EPCOR. The caller claims the account holder is in arrears and asks that cash payments be made immediately or power will be cut off.

“They target small businesses, they say if they don’t make a payment – cash, credit card or bitcoin very quickly, sometimes within the hour – their power will be cut off,” EPCOR spokesperson Tim LeRiche said.

The company stressed that it does not take sudden action like this on billing arrears.

LeRiche said they had received more than 100 complaints about the scam over the last two days and said some people did make a payment to the people on the phone. However, he said they’re seeing fewer people fall for these types of scams.

“Most people now are starting to get familiar with this thing and are suspicious and are calling in or posting to social media and we appreciate that as well.”

Anyone with questions about their account is asked to contact EPCOR at 780-310-4300. People can report suspicious activity to the Edmonton Police Service at 780-423-4567.

“If anybody gets a phone call of this type where they’re being asked about their power bill they shouldn’t be giving any information over the phone and if it does seem suspicious in any way at all they should call us to check.”

The Marianas Regional Fusion Center and the Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense continue to monitor reports of phone scams.

The latest scam purports to be a local telephone number that calls a phone and rings once prompting a call back.

GHS/OCD received information from a snapshot circulating on social media and chat groups alleging that calling back the number would result in your contact list and/or bank details being copied. They do not believe the claims to be valid.

Residents are urged to remain vigilant and avoid answering unexpected calls from international or unusual numbers and do not attempt to return a missed call from an international or unknown number that rings only once.

Report suspicious activity by contacting the MRFC at https://mlrin.org, teammrfc@mlrin.org or 671-475-0400.

Chinese Robocalls Bombarding The U.S. Are Part Of An International Phone Scam

If you live in a part of the country that has a large Chinese immigrant population, you may have recently received a robocall in Mandarin — or even several of them. The calls seem to be blanketing certain phone exchanges without regard to the national origin of the recipients. Presumably, this is how the New York Police Department ended up on the call list.

NYPD Officer Donald McCaffrey, who works in the Queens grand larceny division, is investigating the calls in New York City. He has also been receiving them on a daily basis.

"I get them also, in the NYPD building," McCaffrey says. "I have an NYPD department cellphone and I get them on the cellphones, also. It is out of control."

Non-Mandarin speakers may find the robocalls baffling — or annoying — and just hang up. But some Chinese immigrants who have followed the robocall's prompts have found themselves sucked into an international phone scam.

The calls first came to McCaffrey's attention in December 2017, when a 65-year-old Chinese woman complained to the NYPD that she had been scammed out of $1.3 million.

"She called to report that someone from the Chinese Consulate called and said she needs to call the Beijing Police Department because she's being investigated for financial crimes over in China," McCaffrey says.

The robocall messages are usually some variation on that theme: This is the consulate; we have an important document that needs to be picked up; it may affect your status in the U.S.; press a button to speak with a specialist — and that is when a connection is made to a live scammer.

That person then tries to execute what is known as a "parcel scam" — pretending to be from a courier company and claiming that a package addressed to the victim is connected to a criminal case. The phone call is then transferred to a fake police officer who says that it's a money laundering investigation and that if the victim transfers money to a Hong Kong bank account, the police will resolve the case.

So far, the NYPD has received 30 complaints from people who have lost money to this robocall scam. McCaffrey estimates $3 million has been stolen from the city's residents. The NYPD and security experts who have looked into these calls say they think the calls are originating in mainland China.

The Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in New York says it has been been getting about 100 calls a week from people complaining about the scam and has posted a warning on its website. The consulate became aware of the phone scam last August.

"It's still a severe situation," says Ma Chao, a consulate official.

Ma says he has reported the calls to the Chinese police but was told it would be very difficult to track down the scammers. "These calls could easily be made from anywhere in the world, from Europe or Africa or Asia," he says. He adds that he has heard about similar scams that originate in Taiwan and parts of Southeast Asia.

In the U.S., the scam isn't limited to New York. Similar calls, in Mandarin, have been reported in cities such as Boston and Houston. The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Los Angeles and the embassy in Washington, D.C., have issued warnings about the scam. The Federal Trade Commission, which helps consumers and law enforcement collect information on illegal phone calls, has posted its own warnings.

The calls have also surfaced in Australia and Canada. At a news conference last year, Staff Sgt. Annie Linteau of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the calls reported to the RCMP accused the recipient of a financial crime, just like the calls the NYPD is investigating, but then, the victims are "instructed to isolate themselves, and their family in China are made to believe their loved ones in Canada are abducted." The RCMP calls this scheme "virtual kidnapping."

"You wouldn't expect it, but people do fall for that sort of thing," says Ben Yates, a lawyer based in Hong Kong specializing in cybersecurity and cryptocurrencies at the international law firm RPC.

Yates suspects Chinese living overseas, even law-abiding citizens, are vulnerable because they have legitimate worries about the government monitoring their activities.

"If you're based overseas and you're from mainland China, then you may be concerned about the authorities questioning what you're doing," he says. "Whether it involves transferring money out of China or other aspects of your activities, it could be all kinds of things the authorities could have an interest in.

"You have to understand the sort of regime they're used to dealing with and the sort of political and legal system that operates in mainland China that might be quite different to what you're used to in the U.S."

To add to the confusion, the calls look legitimate because scammers are able to make the caller ID display the number for an actual Chinese Consulate. This is known as "spoofing" and is a common, illegal tactic to get people to answer robocalls, which are illegal in the U.S. unless you have asked to be put on a call list.

Lawyer Yates says that although the scammers are very likely operating out of mainland China, the money is often sent to a Hong Kong bank where it's easier to open an account and raises less suspicion from authorities because of the high volume of international transactions there.

A lack of Mandarin-language skills may protect some people from this robocall scam, but it's not the only one out there. Robocalls are the top complaint at the Federal Communications Commission, with more than 4.5 million in 2017, up from 3.4 million in 2016.

One way to cut down on unwanted calls is to put your phone number on the National Do Not Call Registry.

But the best way to avoid being scammed? When the voice on the other end is a recording, just hang up.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - A pervasive new phone scam aims to steal your identity by obtaining your social security number in order to be compromised.

"It was really legit, it sounded really legit," said Roberto Ortega, who received a call earlier this week.

Scammers are impersonating "agents" with the Social Security Administration.

"They said my social had been suspended for illegal activity and they needed to confirm my identity," Ortega said.

The scammer will then ask to confirm the social security number or threaten that your assets will be frozen. That's the scam, but the catch is the caller may know more about you than you might think.

"He tells me my name, he tells me my phone number, he tells me my date of birth, even my address," said Ortega. "It made it really believable."

According to security experts, some victims are more susceptible than others. For example, if you've ever received a strange text asking to click on a random link; more often than not, that exposes personal information on your device. This then makes certain victim's information more likely to be a target.

The text may also be referred to as a malicious link that aims to gain control of devices or access information.

"You can never be too safe or too secure with your personal information," said Det. Jon Price, with the El Paso County Sheriff's Office.

Price explains victims are just as susceptible to fraud on social media sites, like Facebook. It's a simple search on sites like "Pipl" that allow anyone to dig up specific details about people's lives.

Bottom line, tighten your privacy settings and block spam calls from your phone.

To do this for Facebook, go to your settings page and make sure "friends only" is selected in every box to keep limited access to your profile.

DARE COUNTY, N.C. – If you’ve received threatening calls claiming you owe money and asking for payment over the phone, you aren’t the only one.

The Dare County Sheriff’s Office has received several reports of citizens receiving scam phone calls.

Often the caller claims people owe money – they may say that you have outstanding warrants, or claim that the IRS requires your social security number and money from you. Sometimes they ask you to pay via credit card or prepaid card and send the money electronically.

The Sheriff’s Office has some tips when it comes to scam calls:
• The police will never ask for payment over the phone.
• Do not believe your caller I.D. Scammers can fake caller I.D. numbers using a process called “spoofing.”
• Spot impostors that claim to be from a government entity or charitable organization. Do not give out personal information and do not pay with a credit card over the phone.
• Do not make wire or electronic money transfers to an unknown person.

ST. CLOUD -- The Stearns County Sheriff's office is warning you about a recent phone scam that's circulating around the St. Cloud metro area.

Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson says scammers are calling people and telling them they have pending criminal charges against them. The scammer then directs the person to contact the IRS at a provided number or be subject to arrest.

Authorities say these calls are not authentic and are only being used as a way for the scammer to get money out of you. The IRS doesn't contact people this way.

Gudmundson says if you do receive a call like this, hang up. In some cases, people have received multiple calls. However, it's not necessary to call authorities at this point since they have several reports already filed.

A few days ago, I got a call from a number I didn’t recognize. A string of calls, actually, in a span of about three minutes.

I ignored them at first, like I do with every unknown number that flashes on my cell phone screen (don’t we all?). But after five back-to-back missed calls, there was a growing sense of urgency. So I typed the number into Google, and realized, with horror, that it belonged to a local police station.

I called back, and got the switchboard for Manhattan’s 24th Precinct. Who needs bail money? I wondered. Did that creepy OKCupid date finally murder somebody? Am I being asked to testify?

As I listened to an automated voice rattle off a list of extensions, my phone buzzed again — another call from the precinct. This time, I answered.

“Hi is this Miss Kristen Bahler? This is very urgent. Do you know that you’re the subject of an FBI investigation?”

“Do you know you’re under investigation? Have you been briefed on your file?”

“This is very serious. If you don’t comply, someone will come and arrest you.”

After a few minutes of escalating frustration on both ends, and several failed attempts to press the guy for more information, it finally clicked. This wasn’t a federal agent. This was a scammer.

Eventually, he hung up on me, and I was left with some burning questions. Who was this criminal mastermind, and how did he get my number? What, exactly, was his end game? Did he want my money? My social security number? Do other people get these calls? Do they fall for them? Why did the call come from an ACTUAL POLICE STATION????

The real New York Police Department didn’t have any answers. I called the switchboard again, and tried a few of the extensions. Eventually I got through to an investigator, who told me he didn’t have a clue what I was talking about.

“They called you from this number?” he asked. “And said you’re under investigation? Are you?”

Next, I tried Paige Hanson, identity education lead at the cybersecurity firm Symantec (which makes Norton antivirus software). She was less confused.

“This is a common scam,” she says. “It happens to a lot of people.”

It even has a name: “Spoofing,” a range of techniques criminals use to pretend to be someone they’re not with the help of fake IP addresses, emails, or, in my case, phone numbers. What they wanted was for me to handover my credit card number, in a panic, which they could have charged for any number of purchases, or my social security number, making me one of the more than 15 million Americans who fall prey to identify fraud every year.

It’s actually pretty easy to hijack a phone number, Hanson says. Thanks to apps like “SpoofCard,” anyone with internet access can disguise their personal number with a new one of their choosing — even if it already belongs to a law enforcement agency, a hospital, or an Outback Steakhouse.

These apps market their services as a way for debt collectors, private investigators, and other professionals to mask their identity, and as an all-in-good fun conduit to prank calls. But Hanson says they’ve also empowered fraudsters to scare people into answering bogus calls.

“The urge to answer becomes harder to resist,” she says. And when you do pick up the phone, you get “a fear-based message that sends you into the red zone.”

There’s not a lot of data on how widespread “spoofing” actually is, but fraudulent calls are certainly a problem regulators are grappling with. According to the FTC, the state of New York alone logged more than 16,000 complaints of “imposter” calls last year. Nationally, that number’s close to 300,000. And since a lot of people who get these calls don’t actually report them, those figures are probably just scratching the surface.

How do you suss out a real FBI or police call from a fake one? In a press release about the scam, the FBI warns consumers that “The FBI does not call private citizens threatening arrest or requesting money.” Chances are, if you’re under investigation by the FBI, you won’t learn about it in a phone call.

If you’re not yet deeply unsettled, here’s a bit of info that should do the trick: Services like SpoofCard can completely mask a phone number, so the one users choose to replace it with (the NYPD’s, in my case) is the number that shows up on both your phone bill, and your caller ID.

Gullible consumers aren’t the only ones at risk. A fraudulent phone bill makes it hard for other vulnerable groups, like victims of stalking, to get the proof they need to seek legal protections from an abuser. SpoofCard, for what it’s worth, seems fine with this: A recent blog post on the company’s website gives step-by-step instructions for contacting an ex who’s blocked you from their phone.

Hanson couldn’t say for sure where the scammer got my number from, but says giant data breaches like the 2013 Target breach that resulted in a treasure trove of stolen phone numbers, emails, and credit card information — have made it pretty easy for criminals to get that information too.

As a precaution, she recommended adding my number to the National Do Not Call Registry, a federal department that blocks businesses from slamming consumers with unsolicited calls. Ideally, the registry will cut the volume of calls I receive, and will make me think twice before answering one that does make it through (its likely to be a scam). There are also a number of call-blocking apps that can help manage incoming calls, Hanson points out.

“It’s really just a matter of upping your game,” Hanson says. “Now, you have to be vigilant about where you’re giving your information, what you’re providing, and what phone calls you’re answering.”

Expert-approved advice to never answer the phone again? Now that’s a silver lining.

If it needs to get in touch with a taxpayer, it sends a letter— not an email, not a phone call, and definitely not a message over social media. Especially in cases of tax fraud.

So when I got a voicemail admonishing me for supposed issues with the tax return I filed this year, I knew it had to be the latest IRS phone scam.

A phone number from Washington, DC, called me and left a voicemail when I didn't answer.

It was an automated message that said:

"Time sensitive and urgent ... we found that there was a fraud and misconduct on your tax which you are hiding from federal government. This needs to be rectified immediately, so please return the call as soon as you receive the message."

It told me to return the call to the same DC-area phone number displayed on my caller ID. It's pretty clear this was a scam call, if not for the simple reason that the caller did not identify themselves as someone from the IRS. Also, as previously mentioned, the IRS prefers snail mail.

This is a sophisticated step in the latest tax scam Americans need to watch out for, according to the IRS. Scammers file a fake tax return with stolen personal information, like your Social Security number, and then use actual bank account information to have the refund deposited into your own account.

Then they call to collect, posing as the IRS or debt collectors demanding the return of the fraudulent tax refund. In some cases, the caller threatens criminal fraud charges, an arrest warrant, and to "blacklist" the taxpayer's Social Security Number.

What to do if you receive an IRS scam call or a fraudulent tax refund

Never return a phone call from someone claiming to be with the IRS. Instead, individuals should call the IRS directly at 800-829-1040, and businesses should call 800-829-4933.

The US Department of Justice says the IRS never discusses personal tax issues through unsolicited emails or texts, or over social media. Always be wary if you are contacted by someone claiming to be from the IRS who says you owe money.

If you receive an unexpected and suspicious email from the IRS, forward it to phishing@irs.gov.

If you think you are a victim of identity theft or tax fraud, you should report it to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The IRS also has detailed instructions on what to do if you are a victim of tax fraud. Taxpayers who receive a fraudulent tax refund should follow IRS guidelines for returning the money.

File as soon as possible to protect against other IRS scams

Since tax season presents plenty of opportunity for would-be identity thieves, the best way to protect against these IRS scam calls and other tax scams — especially potential identity theft — is to file your tax return as soon as possible, after you receive your tax forms from your employer in January.

The IRS says the fastest way to get your tax refund is the method already used by most taxpayers: filing electronically and selecting direct deposit as the method for receiving your refund.

Popular online tax services like TurboTax and H&R Block are easy to use, even for tax novices. If you plan to visit an accountant, make an appointment early to avoid the rush.

The IRS says direct deposit — which the government also uses for Social Security and Veterans Affairs payments — is "simple, safe, and secure."

Phone scammers purporting to be from a Chinese consulate office are tricking people in the U.S. into handing over huge sums of money.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the Chinese-language calls appear to be going to “people with Chinese last names.” Those outside the apparent target group may be unaffected by the racket, but the FTC warned everyone to be vigilant as “scammers’ tactics can change quickly.”

The commission said that people across the U.S. have been reporting the calls, which appear to deploy a range of tactics in a bid to trick the recipient. Some begin with an instruction to pick up a package at a nearby Chinese consular office, while others ask for information “to avoid being in trouble with the Chinese consulate,” the FTC said. The scammer could also trick the person into thinking they’re in some kind of trouble and could face arrest if they travel to China. At some point, the caller will ask for personal details such as bank or credit card information, or for a bank transfer to be made.

And the ruse is clearly working. Since December, 21 members of New York City’s Chinese community have lost a total of $2.5 million, according to the New York Police Department, with individuals reporting losses ranging from $1,800 to $1.4 million, according to Voices of NY. Some have lost their life savings.

The caller IDs appear to indicate that the calls are coming from a local number, but investigators say it’s actually coming from a location in China.

 The FTC reminded people never to send money to anyone who asks you to do so over the phone.

“Never give your Social Security number, your bank or credit card number, or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it,” the commission said. “Same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as WeChat: just don’t respond. That’s a scam. And neither the real Chinese consulates, nor the Chinese Embassy, will ever call you to ask for money.”

The FTC told recipients of such scam calls to act decisively: “If you get a call or message like this, hang up or delete it, and then tell the FTC. If you have business with the real Chinese consulate and you’re worried, contact the real Chinese Consulate by looking up your local office’s number. But, whatever you do, don’t give out your information — or your money — to anyone who contacts you out of the blue.”

Detectives from the Montgomery County police financial crimes unit are investigating a phone scam targeting Chinese residents that has resulted in seven county residents of Chinese descent wiring a total of $1.5 million to the scammers.

Five of the victims live in the western part of the county, in Boyds, Germantown and Rockville, Detective Brandon Mengedoht said Friday. Two of the victims are from Silver Spring.

“We believe it is affinity fraud where they target people in their own community,” Mengedoht said. “The victims have wired money to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.”

The scammers calling potential victims speak in a Chinese dialect and claim to represent a Chinese or Hong Kong government organization, such as a law enforcement agency, a government prosecutor or the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., according to a police press statement issued Friday.

The victims are told they have been involved in some type of wrongdoing and that they need to wire money to China or Hong Kong in order to resolve the problem.

In some cases, a victim receives an additional phone call during which a scammer says the person was not involved in wrongdoing, but is instead a victim of identity theft and that additional money is needed to clear the person’s name.

Victims are prompted to give personal and banking information, according to police.

“The receiver is threatened that if he/she does not comply, he will face consequences to include deportation and detention in a Chinese prison,” the police release said. “The receiver is also told not disclose the issue to anyone.”

Investigators are urging residents to share the information about the scam, particularly with those of Chinese descent.

“If you receive a call to send money immediately in order to avoid prosecution or an arrest, it’s going to be a scam,” Mengedoht said.

Residents who think they have been victims of the scam are asked to call the police department at 240-774-6330.

Two seemingly innocuous text messages from Optus were the first signs that hackers had taken control of a Sydney woman's mobile phone and were rapidly stealing her identity.

She didn't know it at the time, but Kate* was the helpless target of a little-known scam called 'SIM swapping', where hackers can gain access to your bank account, email and social media with just a simple phone call to a mobile operator.

Armed with Kate's name, date of birth and number, hackers phoned up the Optus call centre and without her knowledge or consent secretly swapped her phone number to a SIM card held by them.

The two text messages sent by Optus confirmed Kate's "issue" had been resolved. Kate assumed both unexpected texts related to a complaint she had made several weeks earlier. The reality was she'd just been hijacked.

Hackers then quickly broke into her social media accounts and email, where she had stored many personal documents including passport scans and other important information. SIM swap scammers have also been known to successfully crack banking apps linked to mobile phone numbers.

Optus is not the lone target of SIM swap hackers, with reports other Australian mobile phone operators have also been duped. The relative ease with which hackers can execute SIM swaps poses serious questions about the level of security clearance mobile phone operators enforce.

Kate believes the hackers initially swiped her personal details, such as her date of birth, from her Facebook account. Within hours of Kate's phone dropping dead from the network, one of her friends was already being targeted.

Once a Facebook user's account is compromised by SIM scammers, any Facebook friends who list their date of birth and phone number on their personal page will also become vulnerable.

Hackers made numerous phone calls using Kate's number and changed the password of her email and a variety of other accounts.

"After they have control they can use your phone number to get codes for emails, banking and everything," Kate said.

"They can also begin opening up other types of online accounts.

"They need so little information ... I think this is the biggest problem."

Kate contacted Optus via its online chat support and said it took 30 minutes before someone took her complaint seriously.

"First they told me, 'I think someone is doing work in your area', to explain why I had no network coverage," she told nine.com.au.

Eventually an Optus help desk employee informed Kate a hacker had taken control of her number with just the basic details. A block was then put on her number.

"You just don't feel safe. It feels like it can happen again," she said.

More than 200,000 scam reports were submitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in 2017.

Latest ACCC data revealed Australians lost $340 million to scammers last year – a $40 million increase from 2016.

Email has been the primary hunting ground for scammers, but society's growing reliance on mobile phones means that platform will be increasingly heavily targeted.

An Optus spokeswoman told nine.com.au SIM swapping "is an industry-wide issue and we are working together with other telecommunication providers and major banks to mitigate opportunities for fraudulent activity".

The spokeswoman said by the time a fraudster requested a SIM swap - known in the industry as "porting" - the victim and their personal details would have likely already been compromised through a phishing scam or mail theft.

"Unauthorised 'porting' of a number is undertaken by criminals with the intent to access bank accounts," the spokeswoman said.

The spokeswoman said a scammer would need "account detail information" to execute a SIM swap, but did not specify precisely what that entailed.

Worried hackers had access to her passport scans and other tier one type identification documents, Kate went to the NSW police.

"The police told me there was not a financial loss so they can't do anything," Kate said.

She was instructed to lodge a complaint with ACORN, the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network.

Kate said mobile phone companies, such as Optus, need to make it harder for scammers to SIM swap and hijack someone's online identity.

"I tried to make a complaint with Optus but they kept sending me from department to department,” she said.

"People need to be made aware how easy it can be for scammers to do this."

Optus advises customers to report any instance of identity theft to police in the first instance, followed by Optus on 133 927 so that we can investigate the matter.

* Kate is not her real name.

Just like well-known scams in which callers claim to be from the Internal Revenue Service, this phishing scam plays on fear in the Chinese community.

WASHINGTON — A scam targeting the Chinese community in Montgomery County, Maryland, fleeced several people of over a million dollars.

Just like other well-known scams — like the one in which a caller claims to be from the Internal Revenue Service, or another where the victim is threatened with a fine for missing jury duty — this phishing scam plays on fear, said Brandon Mengedoht, a detective with Montgomery County police’s financial crimes division.

“Out of the blue, the speaker on the other end will identify themselves as some type of law enforcement — either the Chinese government [or] from Hong Kong, or Taiwan, in some cases,” said Mengedoht.

The caller will then demand the recipient pay a fine immediately over the phone, and often will call back and demand more money, or claim the payment did not go through.

Since May, just seven victims have lost a combined $1.4 million.

“We had one victim suffer over $700,000 alone,” he said.

Investigators believe the victims could be connected through a church, neighborhood or community listserv containing personal information which ultimately fell into the wrong hands. Mengedoht said the culprit could also be robocalls that cast a wide net, in hope of capturing at least a couple of big fish.

“This is an affinity-type fraud. They’re targeting their own community. There could be victims out there who are embarrassed and don’t want to come forward, but the information they have might lead to identifying who they are or prevent this from happening to the next victim.”

When people talk about phone scams, it's often the variety of fraud that can occur through cold calls to a person's home or mobile device. Like when scammers leave vaguely official sounding voicemails claiming to be Internal Revenue Service agents who need all of your personal information (and probably some form of payment) to close a faux tax audit. Or when some joker calls with the breathless information that you've "won" a free vacation. All you have to do is fork over a couple hundred bucks in "prize tax" to claim a trip that doesn't exist.

But as technology advances, scammers are getting more sophisticated. They're increasingly using fraud to take control of people's phones, often without the device ever leaving a victim's pocket.

"It's almost the same as having the device physically stolen," says Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center. "They could have access to the data for any accounts that you use your phone to access."

It's called "porting out": Thieves use a person's information to switch his or her phone number to a new phone with a new service provider. They can then use the phone to intercept messages. That includes two-factor authentication messages, the codes that banks and others often send their customers to confirm their identity before customers can access their accounts online.

"Essentially, they're getting their hands on your ID credentials somehow," Velasquez says. "Then they're contacting your mobile carrier and transferring those credentials to a new device."

The scam isn't new, but fraudsters are having enough success with it to get mobile phone service providers' attention. T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon have all warned customers in recent months of the threat of porting out schemes. The four major U.S. carriers also have created a task force to come up with ways to better authenticate that folks who ask to move their numbers from one service or phone to another are actually the numbers' owners.

Here's one sure sign that you may be the victim of porting out fraud: Your phone goes dark unexpectedly.

There are plenty of reasons why a phone may shut down, from a shoddy battery, extreme heat, water damage or missed payments. But when a fraudster switches your number to another device, that will also do the trick.

The scam normally starts with a thief getting hold of enough of your personal information to pose as you when asking your phone carrier to port out your number. Info like Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses are often obtained through basic internet and social media searches or through web-based black markets.

If you think you've been victimized by porting out, there are a few things you should do after contacting your phone service provider. Check your bank, credit card and other accounts to make sure you can still log in to them online and that there's been no suspicious activity like unauthorized purchases or information changes. It's also worth considering freezing your credit to stop anyone from opening new accounts in your name. You can also create a fraud alert through credit reporting bureaus as an additional protection. While you're doing that, be sure to snag a free credit report to check for suspicious activity.

Velasquez says there are plenty of things people can do to avoid being ported out in the first place. That starts with changing the way you think about your device.

"We often don't treat a mobile device like the computer that it is," Velasquez says. "You need to think about your device the same way you think about your laptop."

That means getting antivirus and malware protection. It also means using the tools that many cell phone service providers already offer, like port validation protection. Port validation requires device users to create a separate password, which he or she has to enter before the service provider will approve a request to move the number to another phone or account. Some service providers — like Verizon and Sprint — require customers to select a port out validation pin when they sign up for service.

Of course, fraudsters could still find a way to manipulate or get their hands on port validation pins. But the move provides an extra layer of protection that thieves have to get through in order to take your phone.

There is "at least one very significant investigative operation underway" at the moment into one of the largest cyber crimes in Canadian history — the CRA phone scam — with both Canadian and Indian authorities working to shut it down, says Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.

Goodale made the comments while responding to a months-long CBC Marketplace investigation that traced some of those fake tax calls to illegal call centres in Mumbai.

The CRA scam usually begins with an automated phone message claiming that the target is facing a lawsuit over unpaid taxes owed to Canada Revenue Agency, and demanding they call back or face arrest. Those who return the calls face further threats, before being instructed to pay an outstanding sum, sometimes through bitcoin or gift cards.

While in India, Marketplace spoke to Param Bir Singh, the police commissioner of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, who said he only became aware Canadians were being targeted after he visited the RCMP website and saw a posting about it.

"Nobody contacted us from Canada. It doesn't seem right," he said.

But Goodale says those conversations are taking place with other law enforcement officials.

"Canadians can be assured that the RCMP treat this very seriously and want to do everything we can — at home and abroad — to shut it down," he said.

Canadian and Indian authorities are not only in contact, but also co-ordinating with other allies and exchanging intelligence, Goodale said.

"This is going to require, at the international level, an absolutely concerted, focused effort — one that involves not just only one country, but a lot of countries putting the pressure on — for the kind of action that is necessary to keep people safe and protect them from this type of activity."

At least 60,000 Canadians have complained about being targeted by the CRA phone scam over the past five years. More than $10 million has been stolen during that same time period, making it one of the largest cyber scams in Canadian history.

In the days since Marketplace first reported the story, CBC News was flooded with responses via email and social media from Canadians who say they've been harrassed by the threatening calls or fallen victim to the scam, and want the government and police to take action.

"I did phone the RCMP about a year ago and their response was essentially, 'Glad that you know better than to call them back,'" said Manuel Costa. "But [they] weren't interested at all in investigating anything."

"As far as I can tell, the RCMP and CRA think it's our responsibility as individuals to just block these numbers; there's no indication that they're doing anything at all to put a stop to this," wrote Jim Douglas.

"[The] CRA should perhaps be warning potential citizens, and apprise them of what CRA practices are and are not, and also warn them of this scam," said Katie Clough.

The CRA does have a warning on its website that it won't leave personal information on voicemail, and that its agents do not use "aggressive language" or threaten taxpayers with arrest. When in doubt, the CRA suggests you hang up and either check your account online or call the agency back at 1-800-959-8281.

In the lead-up to last week's story, the RCMP declined repeated requests for an interview or any details about its efforts to combat the CRA scam. Instead, they sent a statement, saying public awareness and education are key.

"Fraud is a global problem without borders," the RCMP said. "By working with various municipal, provincial and national law enforcement and government partners, the RCMP is committed to preventing, detecting and deterring crimes that affect the economic integrity of Canada."

The federal policing agency added that "the best way" to combat these types of crime is through prevention — which is a sentiment Goodale shares.

"If you're being solicited for money over the phone, the chances are that it's a fraud and you should hang up."

Megan Clifford was at work when her phone turned off.

Minutes before her phone stopped working on Jan. 8, Clifford received a text message from her cell phone carrier, T-Mobile, saying her online account password was changed and to call the company if she hadn’t made the request. When she got a T-Mobile representative on the phone about 30 minutes later to tell them she hadn’t made any changes, she was too late. The hackers targeting her had already taken oven her account and transferred her cell phone number to a different carrier.

That was just the beginning of Clifford’s month-long struggle to reclaim her identity. While she was still on the phone with T-Mobile, she said she started getting other email alerts: Money from her Bank of America and Chase accounts was being transferred to a “name I didn’t recognize.” That’s when she realized the magnitude of her problem: Now that someone had her cell phone number, they could get into her bank account and gain access the common apps she had on her phone, including Venmo and iTunes.

“I realized I had to tell T-Mobile I have to call them back because it was more urgent that I lock up my bank account information,” she said.

“You have to change every account, your Spotify — literally everything that’s connected to your phone number,” Clifford said. “It stops working and you can have to call customer service. I had to pay other fees too because I had no bank account, and payments were hitting and I couldn’t pay them. I couldn’t even go to the gym.”

Clifford, who asked that her age, occupation and hometown not be published due to privacy concerns, is just one victim of an ongoing cell phone “porting” scheme — a scam that all of the major wireless carriers are dealing with, according to Brian Krebs, an investigative journalist and cyber security expert. Hackers use this technique to circumvent two-factor authentication, a popular security measure wherein a randomly generated code is texted to users’ phones after they input their password. The problem? Once someone steals your phone number, two-factor authentication can no longer protect you because all of the codes are being sent directly to the hacker.

And while people can practice good password hygiene in an attempt to avoid falling prey to these hackers, personal information can still be jeopardized in other ways, like corporate hacks. In fact, T-Mobile customers may have been more susceptible to the attacks due to a data breach at T-Mobile in 2017 that left many customers’ information vulnerable. That security flaw came on the heels of a previous T-Mobile data breach in September 2015, when credit reporting agency Experian was hacked and “an unauthorized party accessed T-Mobile data housed in an Experian server,” according to T-Mobile’s website.

While exact numbers aren’t available on how widespread the unauthorized porting problem is, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile together established a Mobile Authentication Task Force in late 2017.

A T-Mobile spokesperson said these are industry-wide issues, but did acknowledge a recent “uptick” in cell phone hijacking. T-Mobile representatives told MONEY that the company initially sent a text message earlier this year to millions of its customers about the ongoing scams, and would resend it to customers “who didn’t take action the first time.” The company declined to discuss any details about customers’ experiences or when it first learned of the porting scams.

Dozens of other T-Mobile customers affected by this kind of hack have joined a Facebook support group Clifford started called Victims of T-Mobile Porting Identity Theft Scam — six of whom shared similar stories with MONEY about the personal fallout they’ve dealt with after having their numbers ported without their consent.

For Clifford, her problems multiplied after she learned her cell phone number had been fraudulently ported. When she first called T-Mobile, the representative she spoke with was unaware of the cell phone hijacking scam she was trying to describe. “They had no clue what was going on, even though it happened to many people and they eventually sent a text message about it,” Clifford said. “They didn’t have any policy or procedure to get it fixed right away.”

In total, she estimates she lost at least $3,500 from the ordeal — the equivalent of more than a month’s salary for the average American, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The stress and loss of time dealing with the ordeal took a toll, too. Clifford, who is pregnant, described the next month as a blur. She spent the first trimester of her pregnancy in an endless cycle of phone calls with banks and T-Mobile between making trips to the local police station to file fraud claims. Many of those calls were about the $6,000 that was fraudulently transferred out of her account — money that Chase told her she could not get back right away because it was a direct-deposit transfer, not a debit- or credit-card transaction. It took 21 days for the bank to return that money. The bank also froze $14,000 in another one of her accounts, which resulted in her incurring interest and late fees on other bills. None of her direct debit transfers worked either, so bills for utilities like water and trash didn’t go through, and Clifford had to pay fees for voided checks, too.

As with Clifford, a common thread throughout victim’s stories is the money was stolen from their bank account using Zelle, a Venmo-like payment app that lets users transfer money instantly, and has recently been adopted by dozens of banks. People who have used Zelle outside of the T-Mobile porting scam have also had money stolen or unauthorized transactions carried on their accounts, in some cases with Zelle refusing to reimburse them, according to personal accounts recounted to MONEY and recent reports from The New York . Zelle told MONEY “consumers are never liable for unauthorized activity on their accounts. When fraud is reported, or identified, we take immediate steps with our participant banks to investigate and take action, in order to prevent further abuse.” Chase spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said it is “monitoring this closely,” and reimburses customers affected by unauthorized Zelle transactions.

And while Clifford’s money was stolen through Chase and Bank of America accounts, a majority of people in Clifford’s Facebook group whose T-Mobile numbers were hacked had Wells Fargo bank accounts. John Nowicki, a physician and member of Clifford’s Facebook group, said Wells Fargo knew what had happened to his bank account as soon as he walked into his local branch outside of Seattle, Wash. on Jan. 24 to tell them he had been hacked. “It was the bank that told me what happened,” he said. “They said, ‘You don’t happen to have T-Mobile, do you?’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ So they said, ‘We’ve had this issue where T-Mobile customers have had their number ported and then their money stolen from their bank account.'”

A Wells Fargo representative said the bank is aware of the porting scam and has taken a “number of steps to protect customers,” but could not provide specific details about customer’s experiences or their policies.

Unfortunately, this experience has become commonplace for the millions of Americans who have been affected by these types of corporate hacks. And security experts recently told MONEY there is not much consumers can to do protect their private information — a startling reality as more major companies like Equifax, Uber and Yahoo fall victim to hackers.

Two months after her cell-phone hacking nightmare began, Clifford’s life has mostly returned back to normal. She and her husband had to freeze their credit and set up credit monitoring. She got back the 65,000 points, worth roughly $600, on her credit card. But she never got her cell phone number back. Clifford and other victims say the invasion into their privacy has caused long-term changes in their lives — specifically to how they handle their personal information and the companies who have access to that data.

Ben Malek, who owns his own electronics company based in Tampa, Fla., said after his cell phone number was fraudulently ported out, a credit card was taken out in his name and maxed out in the same day, in addition to money being stolen from both his personal and business bank accounts. He said T-Mobile, which normally sends an email confirming any transactions, ported out his number without notifying him. “Not a single notification,” he said. Just like Clifford, “The only reason I found out is because my phone stopped working.”

His debacle continued to follow a similar pattern as Clifford’s. “I got an email from Wells Fargo saying, ‘Thank you for contacting us. Please rate the representative that helped you over the phone,” he said. “I called them and said no changes were made. I received an email from Amtrak welcoming me to my upcoming trip to Washington, D.C. — I had no trip planned there. I pretty much thought everything was gone that night.”

Like Clifford, he said many of the T-Mobile representatives he spoke to had no idea what he was talking about when he called to resolve the problem. Once they did, the company still offered no monetary credits or apologies.

And ironically, prior to this incident, Malek said his phone number was one of the only things that made him feel secure, specifically because of two-factor authentication.

“It was very troubling for me,” he said. “It’s like you have a security system in your house and then you find out people are able to easily call your security company and say, ‘Hey please don’t let the alarm go off,’ and they say, ‘OK sure no problem.'”

- How often do you get scam calls? You pick up the phone and someone's asking for money saying your loved one is in trouble. Well, police say an Upper Darby man is part of a national network that has stolen hundreds of thousands in cash from helpless seniors.

"If the scammers make 1,000 phone calls a day and they get two hits this kind of money they win," Upper Darby Police Superintendent Mike Chitwood said.

Authorities are typically called after the fact when the phone scammers have got your money and there's nothing police can do. Well, that changed a couple of days ago in Upper Darby, Pa

"We got contacted by New York police and we setup a sting operation," Superintendent Chitwood said.

Superintendent Chitwood says their three-month long investigation into Upper Darby as a drop point in an elaborate, extremely lucrative phone scheme paid off Saturday morning.

"We watched the whole thing," he explained.

Police say elderly New York couple hit twice already for tens of thousands by somebody claiming their grandson was locked up was asked to send more—$6,000 cash. According to police, the address was a vacant house, but that package was sent by New York State Police.

"Sure enough, the guy pulls around twice in his car and then the third time he gets out and walks around and picks up the package and that's when we took him down," Superintendent Chitwood said.

Inside 36-year-old Richard Otoo's Upper Darby home—police say they found three more FedEx packages—each containing thousands of dollars in cash.

"Two contained $9,500 in cash and one contained $9,000 in cash," Superintendent Chitwood. "Anybody can be a potential victim—anybody."

"We guestimate $400,000 without blinking an eye. I can't tell you how many more are out there that we don't know about and that's just Upper Darby," Superintendent Chitwood said.

Recently, a retired police officer received a call from a man who claimed he was collecting money for the American Police Officer’s Alliance.

He stated that the organization provided training and equipment for police officers across the nation and that funds were needed “to keep our officers safe.”

The retired officer told the caller he was a retired officer and had never heard of his organization nor received any training or equipment funds from them.

The officer asked the caller where they were located and how long they had been around, and the caller thanked him and hung up.

The phone number that appeared was 267-843-1255, generated from the Philadelphia area.

However, upon further review, the organization was not listed on the IRS website, and any attempt to call the number back led to an automated message saying that all agents were busy at that time.

Police are urging residents to be caution when receiving unsolicited phone calls asking for donations.

Some days, you cannot pick up the phone without running into yet another fraudster demanding money.

Maybe it's not a bad idea to just avoid unknown callers. The con artists keep calling hot spots, after all, where people keep answering the phone.

Americans were blasted by 3.36 billion robocalls in April — up 6.5% from a record set in March, according to the YouMail Robocall Index, a provider of voicemail and call blocking services.

It amounted to about 1,297 robocalls every second.

Most of those calls were from debt collectors, according to YouMail. But robocalls are being sent by fraudsters to make it look like the call is coming directly from the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, your electric company, a bank or Microsoft.

On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $120 million fine against Adrian Abramovich, who was doing business as Marketing Strategy Leaders, which initiated 96.8 million fraudulent robocalls for vacation deals. Abramovich, who lives in Miami, Fla., has denied wrongdoing.

The firm used "neighborhood spoofing" technology to make it seem like calls were from local area codes, even using the first three numbers of the recipient's own phone number to encourage people to answer robocalls, according to the FCC.

Democratic lawmakers in Washington have introduced various bills to stop robocalls, automated calls that use a computerized system to deliver recorded messages to cell phones and landlines. One bill, called the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, would strengthen the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and help the Federal Communications Commission more take action against robocallers.

"Robocalls are a great annoyance for American families, especially American seniors," said U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, in opening remarks at a robocalls hearing before the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection subcommittee.

"One-third of calls are now unwanted robocalls."

Unwanted calls — including illegal robocalls used by criminals pretending to be from the IRS and elsewhere, spoofed calls and telemarketing — are a major source of complaints for regulators. The Federal Trade Commission estimated that fraud from unwanted calls costs consumers about $9.5 billion annually.

In fiscal 2017, the FTC received more than 4.5 million complaints regarding robocalls and nearly another 2.6 million complaints about live callers. Consumers can report unwanted calls at www.ftc.gov/complaint.

Here's what to watch out for now:

If you live in Detroit, you might pick up a call that starts with 313 even if you don't recognize the entire number.

But scammers increasingly know how to manipulate caller ID information to make it seem that the call is from a local area code — even though the con artists might be operating in another state or overseas.

"Scammers use such spoofing to increase the likelihood that consumers pick up the phone and to increase the consumer’s trust in the call," according to a warning from the Federal Communications Commission.

Fraudsters aren't just calling to demand money for unpaid tax bills. Some scams have morphed into attempts to con people into handing over money for fake utility bills, too.

Scammers pretending to be from DTE Energy convinced a Troy man to send $393 by threatening that his power would be shut off in April.

The man told Troy police that he knew he owed money to DTE, so he followed the instructions given by the callers and loaded money on a Green Dot MoneyPak card. Then the consumer called the fraudster back and read him the serial numbers for the MoneyPak card.

Worse yet, the scammer called later that day to demand another $893. And the consumer ended up being scammed out of even more money.

The money flow stopped once the scammer called to demand $1,900 the next day because the callers claimed that "previous payments did not go through." The victim called DTE and was told it was a scam.

Michael Lynch, chief security officer for DTE in Detroit, said the phony utility collection calls are rampant across the country, but typically don't start out with a robocall.

"It starts out with a real person and they call and say, 'We're going to shut off your lights in two hours unless you pay this money,' " Lynch said.

It's all about intimidation.

"They're running the same scam in different places," Lynch said.

He believes that one small group of people, likely in the Philadelphia area, may be running the widespread scam.

Sometimes, people who are called think the demands don't sound right. But then the potential victim thinks they better act quickly to avoid a disaster.

"It seems like the right thing to do, but you get stung in the end," Lynch said.

What should a consumer do if they get one of these calls?

"We highly recommend that they hang up," Lynch said.

Then, DTE customers can call 800-477-4747 to discuss their bills.

In addition to collection calls, consumers are getting hit with other utility-related robocalls.

About 19 million such utility-scam calls were made in March relating to a pitch involving "save money — need your info," according to YouMail.

One scam: A robocall may suggest a program that can pay your utility bills at a discount if you wire money elsewhere first, instead of paying your utility directly.

"Obviously, a bad idea," said YouMail CEO Alex Quilici via e-mail.

Crooks are now using telephone numbers that are spoofed to look like they're from the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers to trick taxpayers into paying nonexistent bills, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

Scam artists have programmed their computers to display the TAC phone number to appear on the taxpayer's Caller ID.

When a taxpayer questions whether the call is real, the con artist directs the taxpayer to the IRS.gov site to "confirm" that the call is from a legitimate number for a local TAC office.

After the taxpayer has "verified" the call number, the fraudsters resume their demands for money — typically on a prepaid card or a gift card.

The use of a prepaid card or a gift card enables a fraudster to practically immediately transfer money from the card purchased by the consumer onto another card held by the crooks. Think of it like transferring two or three Starbucks gift cards onto your Starbucks gold rewards card.

More than 43 million robocalls were made in March alone relating to IRS-related scams — nearly doubling from February, according to YouMail's research.

Regardless of how authentic the caller ID might look, the IRS warns that taxpayers should never fall for unreasonable demands.

"If the contact from the IRS is threatening in any way, demanding immediate payment, and demanding payment by a particular method it’s not the IRS," said Luis Garcia, an IRS spokesperson in Detroit.

Nearly 123 million robocalls were made in March with a promise to get your credit card rates down to 0%. It was the most frequent scam robocall in March, according to YouMail's research.

Sometimes, you'll hear from "Heather in Account Services" or maybe someone from “Card Member Services.”

In some scams, you might be asked for an up-front fee to get the ball rolling on those lower rates. In another twist, scammers promising a low rate might ask you to read off your credit card number first to them over the phone to verify the card.

Don't pay the fee or hand over your credit card information to strangers.

Amendments to the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibit companies that sell relief services like these rate reduction scams on the phone from charging a fee before they settle or reduce your debt.

A better bet? Call the credit card company directly to request a reduced rate.

One word can make a questionable investment seem less suspect — guarantee.

But the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warns that impostors have been posing as securities regulators and offering ironclad investment guarantees in a phony pitch to buy up virtually worthless shares of stock.

Scammers often send investors "official-looking documents, complete with logos and seals" as part of the ploy to make their stock buyback pitch look more legitimate.

In some cases, the con artists want personal information that can be used for ID theft. Or they might ask for an advance fee to handle the sale of some stock.

"Once you send the money, you never see it — or any of the money promised from the stock buyback — again," FINRA warns.

FINRA has a toll-free number for senior investors who have concerns about their brokers and investments, as well as questions about potential scams.

The hotline: 844-574-3577. The phone is staffed from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Eastern on weekdays.

Remember, con artists are able to share lists of names and phone numbers, as well as some financial holdings of potential victims. So they might be able to sound legitimate.

The financial fraudsters are more than willing to make repeated phone calls, too.

Hang up. Do not engage. Do not respond.

The risk of being scammed goes up when you answer some of these calls.

The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has issued a warning about an old scam that has come back with a new twist.
###########################################################################################
Xiao Chen* was studying in Australia when she received the call.

Initially, she was told, in Mandarin, that she had a parcel from DHL. Then she was transferred to a man who introduced himself as a high-level Chinese police officer. He told her she was in big trouble. She’d been implicated in a transnational financial crime involving a notorious criminal. There was a strong case against her, he said, and if she didn’t cooperate she’d be locked up. He sent her a warrant with her photo on it.

“I was worried and very scared. He said this case is a classified case, so I can’t tell anyone about it,” she told SBS Viceland’s The Feed.

Xiao Chen was told she was now under surveillance, and her every move was being monitored.

When she protested her innocence, the police officer said he could help. But it would cost: $4,000 for an expedited investigation, $90,000 as a kind of security bond, and $250,000 for a civil liability case.

“Every time they made me send money, there was a reason. At the start I wouldn’t understand. They would explain it, and I would pretty much understand. But not everything. I just trusted them, so I did what they said.”

What she didn’t know was that it was all a fabrication, and the man wasn’t a police officer at all.

Xiao Chen had been lured into a sophisticated phone scam that has been targeting Chinese-speakers around the world. In Australia, victims have paid more than $9 million. And that’s just the cases that police know of.

The scam has evolved and victims - sometimes young international students - have been coerced into extraordinary situations. In both NSW and Victoria, some victims have been asked by the scammer to stage their own kidnapping in order to get money from their parents overseas. Victoria Police have released photos that show victims gagged and bound, as if they’ve been kidnapped. But no-one has actually been held against their will. The photos are staged by victims, who then send them to their parents, who then transfer money that victims can then give to the scammer.

An investigation by The Feed has traced the phone scams back to crime syndicates based in Taiwan. The calls can literally be made anywhere - the syndicates arrange for lower-level members to rent properties and set up call centres in other countries in order to exploit jurisdictional boundaries.

Over a period of 10 days, Xiao Chen transferred nearly $500,000 to the so-called police officer and others who were working with him.

When her own money ran out, they coached her on how to lie to her parents back in China to get more. Xiao Chen’s mother thought it was for a security deposit related to her daughter’s visa, and that the money would just sit in the bank. She’d borrowed some of it from family and friends.

But when Xiao Chen dropped out of contact, and the money disappeared from the account, her mother and family knew something was wrong.

Under instruction from the scammer, Xiao Chen had left her house and was awaiting further instruction at a hotel room. She’d been told the case against her had just escalated, and she was in even bigger trouble. Alone and confused, she ignored frantic messages and calls from her parents.

“I really wanted to answer the phone, but it was a kind of “mind control”. It was a psychological control. I didn’t dare answer them...I just grew more nervous and didn’t know what to do.” Right up until the end, she believed she’d been dealing with the police.

After several days, Xiao Chen’s family and the real police were able to locate her using the “find my phone” function on her iPhone.

The first thing they did was reassure her that she wasn’t a criminal - she was a victim.

The Australian Federal Police are investigating the recent phone scam targeting Mandarin speakers, but it’s not the first of its kind.

The call centres have even been located in Australia.

In 2015, the AFP was called to investigate a house in suburban Brisbane.What they found perplexed them.

“The house had been set up like a business, and there was desks and... telephones, there were lots of iPads, lots of chargers and things like that,” recalls Detective Superintendent Glen Fisher.

On the upper level, police found 23 Taiwanese huddled in a bedroom. Their passports, mobile phones and personal belongings were locked away in a separate room on the ground floor.

Police also found documents and recordings that would eventually be used in court to prove that this was a kind of boiler room, where Taiwanese on working holiday visas were being forced to work 10-12 hours a day making scam calls, targeting victims in China.

The call centre managers were arrested and convicted - not for the fraud - but on slavery charges.

The case offers a unique chance to get a glimpse at the inner workings of a phone scam network. Detective Superintendent Glen Fisher says they’re run by organised crime groups who see it as just another source of revenue. And they do their research.

“The extra-territorial conditions that would be enforceable in that country, the ability to extradite and service mutual assistance requests... that's all taken into account by the criminal syndicate when they set these businesses up.”

Tucked away in suburban homes, they can be difficult for law enforcement to uncover. Police were only made aware of the Brisbane call centre after one of the workers ran away and reported it.

To date, there have been no arrests associated with the recent scam call that caught out Xiao Chen and so many others.

Xiao Chen is now wondering how she will ever be able to move on. She feels deeply ashamed and doesn’t know how she will ever repay her family.

It might be cold comfort, but Detective Superintendent Glen Fisher says victims need to consider just who they’ve been duped by.

“I understand that people may feel embarrassed that they've paid money, but these are professional criminals. These are individuals who make a living out of tricking people to take their money, as simple as that”.

A woman in Selwyn Township is out $10,000 after falling for a phone scam which claimed her son was involved in a motor vehicle collision.

Peterborough County OPP say they were asked to investigate a fraud on Friday night in which a woman said she was contacted by someone claiming to be her son.

Police say the caller also claimed he had been involved in a motor vehicle collision which injured a child and subsequently had been arrested for impaired driving. He told the woman he required $10,000 in order to be released from jail.

“The complainant also stated she had spoken to another male who stated he was her son’s lawyer,” police said.

Police note the woman eventually sent $10,000 via a bank transfer “before realizing this may be a scam.”

Well, it makes a change from a regular technical support scam.

Guest contributor Bob Covello describes an unexpected phone call he received out of the red.



I recently received one of those phony support scam phone calls.

This was not the usual one where the caller claims to be a Microsoft technician who needs to fix your computer. Rather, the caller, a woman, said that two Russians have connected to my network, and the caller was going to help me fix it.

I told her that I seriously doubted what she was telling me.

She then asked me if I knew Dmitry Andreysky or Vladimir Kanavalov (or some other name that she derived from her fake name generator).

I knew it was a scam, so I decided to play along and told her that Dmitry and Vladimir were my buddies. Unfortunately, the caller became annoyed, and said “Well, they are in your house,” and then she hung up.

It seems that the scammers are trying to capitalize on the “Russians are attacking” news headlines.

Most of us in the security industry are very familiar with these scam calls, and some have even taken to making it a hobby of keeping the caller on the line long enough to waste their time in the hopes that it prevents them from targeting a less-suspecting victim.

Sadly, these scams are still effective, as there are many folks who still fall victim to surrendering credit card information for useless services, or allowing a remote hacker to gain access to our PC.

Please remind your friends and family of the following tips to prevent them from falling prey to these scammers:
• Microsoft, The , and any other government agency will not initiate a call to you to offer services or threaten legal action.
• Never allow remote access to your computer to any strangers from unsolicited phone calls.
• Never enrol in computer security, maintenance or warranty programs offered during an unsolicited phone call.
• Never give credit card information over the phone unless you initiated the phone call.

He needed money, and his friend knew someone who knew someone. That’s how Ah Wei* got started in the phone scam business – first as a runner collecting victim’s money from ATMs, then as a phone operator and manager of a call centre in Taiwan. He says he’s also recruited and trained others in the psychology of scamming.

“Usually, we play on people’s anxieties and fears,” he told SBS Viceland’s The Feed. “And we keep them on the phone and don’t give them time to think”.

Mandarin speakers in Australia have recently been targeted in an elaborate phone scam - police say victims have paid more than $9 million. The caller says they’re from DHL or the Chinese consulate, and then transfers the phone to a person pretending to be from the police or Interpol.

It’s a lucrative trade. One Chinese student in Australia, Xiao Chen*, told The Feed that she handed over nearly $500,000 during a 10 day-long ordeal.

Ah Wei is familiar with this kind of set-up.

“I’ll call and say you’ve been implicated in a criminal case, we have a subpoena and you have to appear at court to explain. But you have to pay a security bond, to ensure you don’t flee the country.”

Another, that’s recently been seen in Australia, targets parents. According to Ah Wei, they’re told their son or daughter has been kidnapped or will be harmed unless the parents pay some money.

“If you’re dealing with a daughter, you arrange to have a woman in the background screaming ‘mum, help me...’. (The parents) will think their daughter is being hit.”

The scams are often run from rented villas that are set-up solely for the purpose of making the calls.

Ah Wei says phone operators are recruited by word-of-mouth and recruitment ads. The workers are trained and given scripts, and a list of phone numbers and personal information. They’re not allowed to leave the house while the scam operation is underway - this could be anywhere from one to three months.

“A lot of people hear how much they can earn, and even though they know it’s a scam, they’ll still do it,” according to Ah Wei.

Phone scams originating in Taiwan date back to the late 1990s . They’ve since evolved, and syndicates have branched out overseas. Some call centres have even been located in Australia.

Ah Wei says he’s now out of the game because he began to understand just who he was taking money from.

“One time I came across a little old lady at the bank who’d been scammed out of $27,000. Her children were standing there abusing her. I thought, what if that money was part of what I’d taken that day? What if my mother was scammed?”

Ah Wei now wants to give advice to people who suspect there’s a scammer on the other end of the line.

“Take the time to think it over with a cool-head. Don’t just believe what a stranger on the phone says.”

Many of us are already conditioned to ignore phone calls from unknown numbers. A new study seems to validate that M.O.

By next year, nearly half of the mobile phone calls we get will be scams, according to a new report from First Orion, a company that provides calls management and protection for T-Mobile, MetroPCs, Virgin Mobile and others.

The percentage of scam calls in US mobile traffic increased from 3.7 percent last year to 29.2 percent this year, and it's predicted to rise to 44.6 percent in 2019, First Orion said in a press release Wednesday.

The most popular method scammers use to try to get people to pick up the phone is called "neighborhood spoofing," where they disguise their numbers with a local prefix so people presume the calls are safe to pick up, First Orion said. Third-party call blocking apps may help protect consumers from known scam numbers, but they can't tell if a scammer hijacks someone's number and uses it for scam calls.

"Year after year, the scam call epidemic bombards consumers at record-breaking levels, surpassing the previous year and scammers increasingly invade our privacy at new extremes," First Orion CEO Charles Morgan said in the press release.

First Orion in April testified before the US House Committee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection about combating robocalls, scam calls and caller ID spoofing with technologies. The company works with carrier giants like T-Mobile to alert consumers of scam calls by displaying "Scam Likely" as caller ID on their phones.

"Scammers relentlessly inundate mobile phones with increasingly convincing and scary calls," said Gavin Macomber, senior vice president of marketing at First Orion, in an email statement. "Solving a problem of this magnitude requires a comprehensive, in-network carrier solution that dives deeper than third-party applications ever could by detecting and eliminating unwanted and malicious calls before they reach your phone."

DALLAS (CBS Local)- Dallas-based AT&T is warning its customers about a new scam that is targeting customers.

According to WAFB, customers have been reporting calls in which the caller tells them that their service is being suspended until they verify their account.

The caller then asks for the customer to give the last four digits of their Social Security Number.

In a statement to the station, AT&T says that the calls are not coming from the company and that customers need to be vigilant about any calls in which a company asks you to verify personal information.

“These calls are not from us. If any company calls you and asks for your personal information, that is a red flag. One of our tips on our new Cyber Aware website is never give such information to someone who calls you. Call the company at the number found on your bill.”

Local law enforcement say someone is calling Texomans, claiming to be with the IRS demanding you pay up or face arrest from local officers.

Sherman police say they have received over 20 calls with questions about these scams in just the last two days, but that thankfully no one has fallen victim so far.

Paris Police have reported the same scam in their area this week.

The caller says local police will come to arrest you if you don't pay up immediately.

Police say if you get one of these calls, just hang up. The real IRS won't call you about a warrant.

The embassy also advised recipients of such calls or SMS to refrain from transferring any money or bank accounts details of the callers.

Recently, the so-called ‘’World Winner’’ lottery swindled many people with fraudulent calls about winners. Several such cases happened in Singapore, according to Singapore police.

“They are targeting not only Myanmar nationals but also other foreigners. I haven’t heard any reported cases on this illegal activity,” Ma Aye Mar Mar, who works in Singapore, told The Myanmar Times.

She added that the culprits often ask for bank details to allegedly transfer the winnings of the lucky draw.

“If we give them our bank account details and phone number, they can take out all of the money from our account,” said Ma Aye Mar Mar.

She was targetted by such a scam last week in Singapore, but did not provide any information. Ma Aye Mar Mar posted her experience on Facebook to raise awareness.

The Myanmar embassy urged Myanmar nationals targetted by such scams to immediately report them to the Singapore police with screenshots.

A Calgary grandmother outsmarted would-be phone scammers and is now warning others to be cautious of the sophisticated scheme.

Anne Buckley was at home on Saturday when she got an unexpected call to her landline.

"It was a very classy-sounding lady with a lovely British accent who said she was the manager of Tiffany's in Chinook [mall]," Buckley said.

The woman, who said her name was Mary Gilmore, said she was calling to warn Buckley someone was trying to charge $14,000 to her credit card.

The woman had Buckley's name and home address and told her they would not ask her for personal information but insisted Buckley call her bank.

CBC News previously reported on this scam back in February when victims in Toronto were duped out of more than $5 million.

It usually goes like this: scammers call the would-be victim on their landline and purport to be a retailer contacting the victim to report their credit card is being used for a fraudulent purchase.

The caller tells the victim to contact 911, or, in some cases, their bank, to alert them to the attempted fraud.

The crux of the scam involves the victim, believing the caller has hung up, dials 911 or their bank. In reality, the scammer remains on the line and the victim then speaks to another partner in the scam, posing as police or a bank investigator.

In the case of the Toronto victims, they were urged to transfer money into a specific, separate bank account to protect it during the "investigation."

Buckley believes in this case, they wanted to pose as her bank so she would reveal her credit card information.

While the woman on the other end of the line sounded convincing and wasn't asking for any personal information, Buckley knew something wasn't right and remembered reading about a similar incident in the news.

"I remembered the story, so I wasn't phoning my bank or anyone from my landline," Buckley said.

"I looked online and there had been no purchases go through my card, however I was concerned. I thought it was a scam but I really wanted to make sure this wasn't going through on my card, so I phoned Tiffany's."

The employee at Tiffany's confirmed Buckley's suspicions that no Mary Gilmore worked at that store. They also told Buckley she was the seventh person to call with the same concerns that day.

When Buckley failed to use her landline within five to 10 minutes, the fake Tiffany's manager called again and asked if she had made the call and kept pressing her to do it.

She also said Buckley could give them the phone number off the back of her credit card — which would reveal which company she deals with.

Tiffany & Co. confirms there is an open investigation into the matter with the Calgary Police Service. Buckley has been in touch with police to have her information added to the file.

- We all get them: the never-ending robocalls.

“In the last week and a half, probably three or four a day,” said Jon Lane, of Sanford.

“I'm on every do not call list I can be on. I would say at least five a day,” said Sandy Nicholas, of Lake Mary.

Now the State of Florida is taking a stance.

"It is a nuisance. A lot of times, these scam artists are trying to prey on our most vulnerable populations,” said Devin Galetta, from the Department of Financial Services.

The Department of Financial Services is pushing for harsher penalties and bigger fines against the phone scammers doing neighborhood spoofing. You know which kind of robocalls we’re talking about.

“Somehow they get your number and then they use it and it looks like it's from your neighbor,” said Nicholas.

“They show up usually with a similar area code to my phone number and I've really just been ignoring them,” said Lane.

It’s those spoofing calls that can be the most dangerous. If you even answer with a simple hello, the scammer may be recording your voice.

That’s why the Better Business Bureau says with any of these calls, “if you don’t know the phone number, just don’t answer it,” said Erika Urdaneta.

If you already have, Urdaneta says “just listen. see what they have to say. Don't say yes. Don't give any of your information.”

The Blount County Sheriff’s Office is warning residents of a phone scam in the Maryville area.

The phone scammers are calling Blount County residents and claiming to be Blount County Sheriff’s Office employees. The calls typically include claims of an arrest warrant for unpaid traffic tickets.

The caller then tells the individual they need to buy a prepaid credit card to pay the balance or they will be arrested.

The sheriff’s office posted a statement on its Facebook page that the office “will never call an individual to tell them that they owe money on an unpaid traffic ticket or any other costs.”

The post also emphasized the office will never ask anyone to purchase a prepaid credit card to pay outstanding fines.

If you receive a call of this nature, officials urge residents to hang up and notify the Blount County Sheriff’s Office.

Thousands of people across NSW have reported receiving a call from someone speaking in Mandarin, and police are aware of people who have fallen victim to the scam.

Investigators have been told the calls involve demands for money under the threat of violence or harm to the receiver, their family and/or friends.

There have been reports victims across Australia, as well as New Zealand, USA, Canada, and United Kingdom, have been scammed of millions of dollars.

“The caller purports to be a government official and the essence of the scam is to convince the victim they are in trouble, but they can pay their way out of it,” Det Supt Howlett said.

“We’ve been told victims are contacted either on their mobile phone or via an app, such as ‘WeChat’, and while the incoming number appears to be from a local landline, it has been ‘spoofed’ or ‘ported’ to an unknown location.

“The call often starts with a recorded message in English or Mandarin, and transfers to a person claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.

“The caller claims the victim has been implicated in a crime or their identity has been stolen, which could impact on their visa to stay in Australia or harm could come to their family back home.

“The victim is then told the call will be transferred to the “investigators” or “police”, who demand personal details, including bank accounts, PINs, passports, family information, and in some cases, cash payments.

“In some cases, the victim is told not to speak to friends or family as it may put them in danger too.”

“They have advised they would never call citizens to convey the notice of Chinese police, financial institutions, or other organisations,” Det Supt Howlett said.

“While we are working with our law enforcement colleagues to investigate the origins of the scam, we are urging the community to heed our warning not to respond to the caller’s demands.

Police are urging anyone with information that may assist investigators in relation to this scam to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: nsw.crimestoppers.com.au.

Further, police remind the public to take the following precautions to reduce the risk of being scammed by cold-callers:

If you have been the victim of a scam, you can report it to local police or to the ACCC online at the ‘SCAMwatch report a scam’ page or by calling 1300 795 995.

A call-blocking technology firm recently predicted that next year, nearly half of all cell phone calls will be from scammers.

The firm, First Orion, is predicting that 45 percent of cell phone calls will be scams in 2019. That's from 3.7 percent of total calls in 2017 to more than 29 percent this year.

One of the most recent techniques scammers are using is called neighborhood spoofing. It involves the scammers phone number coming up on your caller ID with the same area code and prefix as your phone number.

Steven Andres, SDSU management information systems lecturer, will join Midday Edition on Wednesday to discuss this technique and the ways individuals can avoid these calls.

The latest wave of an international phone scam is affecting New Zealanders and mobile companies are warning people not to call back.

The scam appears as a missed international phone call and charges the user hefty international fees if they return it.

2degrees spokesman Paul Brislen said the scam is unsophisticated but is affecting mobile phone users from multiple international networks.

The scam is computer generated and almost impossible to stop as the calling number changes every time, he said.

"You start off with 001001 and that doesn't ring so you go through to 001002 and that one rings, great we've got a live number, then they try 001003 and they just make their way up the number range until they hit out numbers.

"So I presume they've reached the +64 bracket, which is New Zealand, and they're trying all the numbers they can find", he said.

Eventually the scammers will move on to target other international numbers, he said.

Customers who have returned unknown international phone calls should check their phone bills and contact their network if they've been affected, he said.

Spark said its customers have also been targeted while a Vodafone user told RNZ of getting repeated missed calls from a Canadian number for months.

(9/13/2018) - More than 100 phone calls have flooded the Portage County Sheriff's Office recently because of an aggressive phone scam targeting taxpayers.

Victims are being told they must pay out a large amount of money or be arrested.

This is the latest scam hitting residents in Portage County where even the sheriff received one of those calls.

"I actually received a call and they said the local sheriff is going to come pick me up. I played it out for a little while and after a couple minutes I asked him if he knew who the local sheriff was and he said no did you get a hold of him? I said I am the local sheriff and he hung up," said Portage County Sheriff Mike Lukas.

The scammers use fake names and bogus IRS identification numbers and, in some cases, they may know a lot about who they are calling. Even the caller ID can appear to look like it is the IRS.

Jennifer Sisley was one of those residents who received one of those calls. She got a voicemail from one of the scammers but knew it must have been a scam because she got another one earlier this year.

"Earlier this year I got a voicemail that I was going to be taken into custody and I thought 'Oh my god what do I do?' But this one I was kind of taken like this isn't real. They were saying I was going to be taken into custody by the local cops for serious allegations against my name," said Sisley.

If you get one of these calls police say to never give out any personal information.

"Immediately hang up and call your local authorities or verify with your family members that everyone is okay. Those are definitely scams," said Sheriff Lukas.

"Just ignore these calls and if they leave a voicemail just delete it," said Sisley.

Have you been receiving mobile phone calls from a number starting with the digits 0088?

People across Kilkenny have been reporting receiving calls from international numbers starting with 0088 or +88. Do not answer these calls as they are part of a scam.

The caller will allow the phone to ring a few times before hanging up, leading to missed call messages on your mobile.

Do NOT ring the number back. This is all part of the 'Wangiri' scam which originated in Japan but is now being used by con artists worldwide.

So how does it work?

In order for mobile phone networks across different countries to communicate with each other, there is a system set up that processes the connections and also makes sure that any international charges are passed on to the person making the call, from the country the call was made to.

For example, if it costs you €2 to call a mobile in South Africa, this system makes sure the right amount of charges are billed to you for that international connection time.

What's happening with the Wangiri scam is the fraudsters behind the con, compromise that system of international charges.

The fraudsters rely on you calling back the number after you note the missed call. Be warned that if you do, they pocket the cost per minute of that call and the charges are huge.

The best advice is to not answer any call from a number you don't recognise and never answer a number starting with 0088.

PERRY - Another scam is making the rounds in the metro.

A Perry woman says someone called her, claiming he worked for a tech company, in an attempt to remotely hack into her computer. She says it's been one major headache for her ever since then.

"He gave me my email address and said it was compromised, and I was like, he knows what he's talking about.," said Gerry Bacon of Perry. "He's got my email address. He's from Google."

"Sometimes that fear allows scammers to get into your computer," explained Perry Police Chief Eric Vaughn.

Bacon says she got a surprising call on Saturday morning.

"My son had Googled it while I was on the phone, and said, 'Mom, hang up it's a scam.' So, I hung up," she explained.

But she says the caller was persistent.

"Then, he tried calling back on a restricted number and he was like, why did you hang up on me?'" she recalled. "And I told him, 'Because you're a scam. You just hacked into my computer' And I hung up."

But the damage may have already been done. Bacon reached out to Perry Police and even the FBI for help.

"All my clients' information, addresses, phone numbers are on there," said Bacon. "So, I had to disconnect WiFi immediately."

Police say she's not the only one. They've been getting at least one call a week from scammers, who've gotten far more sophisticated with phones.

"Now, we see them spoofing local numbers even. If you don't recognize that number, let it go to voicemail and see what it says," said Vaughn.

"I have a cousin whose girlfriend got a call from '515' that did the same thing, and I have an elderly mom that's in the hospital, and so if I see a restricted number coming through, I'm going to take it because I bet it's going to be the hospital," said Bacon.

Bacon had to wipe her computer clean and she's frustrated that anyone would think to target her or anyone else like her.

"It's like, really, people," she said. "Come on, get better stuff to do than to bug us little people. If they want to take my credit and my identity, there's nothing there."

Police tell Local 5 that if someone calls you claiming to be with an agency like the IRS or Google, don't believe it. They will never call for collection over the phone. Also, be on the lookout for any time someone on the phone asks you to make a payment with a gift debit card or credit card.

You've probably got the call: An automated message threatens you with arrest over unpaid taxes. Call back and you'll be further threatened by someone claiming to be an agent of Canada Revenue Agency.

They may demand as little as $700 — though some have handed over more than $100,000.

At least 60,000 Canadians have complained about being targeted by the phone scam over the past five years. More than $10 million dollars has been stolen in that same time period, making it one of the largest cyberscams in Canadian history.

After weeks of investigating and cultivating sources inside the scam centres, CBC's Marketplace tracked some of the calls to a nondescript, low-rise apartment building in one of Mumbai's seedier neighbourhoods.

When our team went to confront the scammers, a group of men — believed to be armed — gave chase through the crowded, sometimes dangerous alleyways of India's largest city.

"They're nothing but financial terrorists," said Ritesh Bhatia, a top cybercrime investigator in India. "It's a huge operation, a big industry."

Who falls for the scam?

Gehangir Rashidi, 63, funnelled an astounding $110,000 — his entire life savings, and then some — into bitcoin machines around Toronto after getting one of these threatening calls at home, saying he owed back taxes.

"I said 'I don't have it,'" Rashidi recalls telling the scammers. "They said, 'Go and borrow it from the bank. Go to a friend. Go to your employer. Go wherever you can to make money, but you have to pay."

Rashidi is deeply embarrassed he fell for the scam now. But at the time, the immigrant believed a government would call and threaten a citizen; it happens in his native Iran.

Most potential victims simply hang up, or never return the call. But the scammers are also employing new tactics in an attempt to convince people to hand over their cash, from posing as a victim's accountant, to using technology which prevents a victim from hanging up the phone.

The most sought-after prey are often the most vulnerable in Canada: the elderly and new immigrants.

How the scammers do it?

Robo-dialers call Canadian cellphones and landlines en masse, leaving a message that tells the recipient to call back. Those who do begin with a "call opener" who typically outlines a series of threats, including arrest, loss of employment, seizure of assets, and even the removal of their children.

But just as quickly, they offer to help the caller clear his or her name through a quick payment and a reduced fine, often in the thousands of dollars.

If a caller agrees, they are transferred to a "call closer," much like in a sales operation, who continues listing off threats and outlines where the money should come from and how it should be transferred. These details are often described in such a way as to avoid raising the suspicions of a bank.

After digging up information about a caller online, such as where they live and work, the scammers rely on mapping tools to identify the nearby banks, directing the victim to these locations.

In some cases, if you try to hang up — to call your accountant, bank or a family member — the scammers may use something known as call-trapping software, says Bhatia, which prevents your line from hanging up. The technology is more often used in espionage, but less reliable versions of the software can be purchased online, and may only trap a phone line for a couple of minutes.

That's what happened to a Toronto-area man we're calling Joe. Marketplace is protecting his identity, as he worries his employer will judge him for a mistake that cost him $36,600.

"Since I come in this country, I start to save money — it's about 28 years," he said.

The scammers were firm with Joe, but told him they were there to help. He was facing a tax problem, they said, but they could get him out of it — if he acted fast.

'Joe' describes the impact of losing more than $36,000 to the CRA tax scam:

Joe was told to withdraw the cash and deposit it into a bitcoin machine. He went from branch to branch, drawing down his savings; he was instructed by the scammers to tell any suspicious bank employees he was buying furniture.

When Joe questioned them, they asked for his accountant's name, before seemingly dialing the phone. Another voice, pretending to be the accountant's office, confirmed the amount owing.

Other scammers in the operation were likely using this time to research details about Joe online, using the information to bolster their claims of legitimacy.

At the end of the call, when the money was sent, Joe said they laughed and hung up.

Those carrying out the scam are young, usually in their 20s, and veterans of Mumbai's legitimate call centres, where English-language skills and an understanding of Western countries are a must.

The earning potential is huge: a typical month's salary can be earned in just one night. The more you steal from an unsuspecting Canadian, the more you take home.

Jayesh Dubey, a former call centre employee turned whistleblower, once profited from the scheme. "It was big money," he said. "I cannot make it anywhere [else]."

The scam is especially lucrative for those at the top. One of the few kingpins to be arrested, Sagar (Shaggy) Thakkar, was in the process of buying a private plane when the Indian police swooped in.

Thakkar was swept up after a major raid that led to hundreds of arrests and prosecutions, after U.S. authorities got a tip and asked India to intervene in a similar IRS scam targeting Americans.

Since the high-profile arrests, criminal gangs have made their operations smaller and more agile, operating out of apartments or small commercial spaces that are easier to pack up and move. Fearful of being exposed, the masterminds often only hire those they know or those known to their existing staff.

Sudhir Kotian got the invite and went inside one of the scam centres with a hidden camera. Kotian was discovered and attacked, though he eventually managed to escape.

"I was screaming as they hit me — they hit me, hit me, hit me. They slapped me, hit me a lot. I was screaming, 'Save me, save me,' and walking backward, screaming loudly."

Kotian's hair was pulled and his clothing ripped; his phone, wallet and camera were all taken.

Indian police say they are ready to crack down on these operations, but need Canadian police to tell them about victims — and share details about the scammers.

Indian Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh said he only became aware that the scammers were targeting Canadians after he visited the RCMP website himself and saw a posting about it.

"Nobody contacted us from Canada. It doesn't seem right," he told Marketplace in an interview.

But in a statement later provided by the office of Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the RCMP is "most definitely" working with Indian law enforcement on CRA fraud-related complaints. The statement said: "Mr Singh is not among the partners the RCMP works with in India."

The statement also said that phone scams are part of what the National Cybercrime Co-ordination Unit, which was announced in the 2018 budget, will be tackling.

This man infiltrated one of the illegal call centres behind those fake CRA calls:

The RCMP declined repeated requests for an on-camera interview on the CRA phone scam, and didn't answer questions about what specific actions they've taken to investigate the illegal overseas call centres.

"Fraud is a global problem without borders," the RCMP said in a statement. "By working with various municipal, provincial and national law enforcement and government partners, the RCMP is committed to preventing, detecting and deterring crimes that affect the economic integrity of Canada."

The federal policing agency added that "the best way" to combat these types of crime is through prevention. "Public awareness is an important tool in preventing the victimization of Canadians."

The Mounties also produce a regular report on cybercrime in Canada. In 2014, the report noted phone-based scams are notable for their frequency — part of a trend suggesting that cybercrime is on the rise.

The CRA has a warning on its website that it won't leave personal information on voicemail, and that its agents do not use "aggressive language" or threaten taxpayers with arrest. When in doubt, the CRA suggests you hang up and either check your account online or call the agency back at 1-800-959-8281.

Tax season may be over for most taxpayers, but when it comes to identity theft, scammers are still hard at work. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is warning taxpayers about a "new twist on an old phone scam." In the scam, thieves use telephone numbers that look like IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC) office numbers to trick taxpayers into paying fake tax bills. Here's what you need to know.

In the latest version of the phone scam, criminals purporting to be from your local IRS TAC office are making calls demanding tax payments. Your caller ID may even display a TAC number during the call since the scammers have programmed their computers to display the TAC telephone number. If you question whether the call is legitimate, the crooks will advise you to double-check the local TAC number with the IRS.gov website. Then the scammers call you back and demand payment again, usually by debit card.

Like most big agencies, the IRS has a division of labor. Collection efforts typically stem from - you guessed it - the Collections Department and involve a series of notices sent by U.S. Mail (for more info, check out IRS Pub 594, The Collections Process, which downloads as a pdf). Your first contact from collections will not begin with a phone call.

TAC offices do not make calls to taxpayers to demand payment of outstanding tax bills. Rather, TAC offices offer in-person help for taxpayers. Some TAC offices also offer in-person document review for form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (downloads as a pdf). All TAC offices operate by appointment only (find one near you here).

The calls are being spoofed, meaning that the scammers have changed the caller ID to make it look like they are calling from an IRS TAC office. Don't be fooled. Scammers also have spoofed local police offices, the Department of Motor Vehicles, immigration agencies and other federal agencies in an effort to convince taxpayers the call is legitimate. Spoofing also happens in emails: Thieves will tamper with the "from" line in scam emails to make you believe that the email is from the IRS or other agency.

Use care. Don't engage with scammers or thieves, even if you want to tell them that you know it's a scam, or you think that you can best them. Just hang up.

If you feel like you've heard these warnings before, you're not wrong: The IRS still says that phone scams are "a major threat to taxpayers." In 2018, phone scams held down the top spot on the IRS "Dirty Dozen" list of tax scams, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reports they have become aware of over 12,716 victims who have collectively paid over $63 million as a result of phone scams since October 2013.

Don't be a victim. Remember that the IRS will never:
• Call to demand immediate payment over the phone, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.
• Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
• Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
• Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.
• Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.

Again, don't engage or respond with scammers. Here's what to do if you receive a suspicious phone call or message:
• If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you do not owe tax, or if you are immediately aware that it's a scam, don't engage with the scammer and do not give out any information. Just hang up.
• If you receive a telephone message from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you do not owe tax, or if you are immediately aware that it's a scam, don't call them back.
• If you receive a phone call from someone claiming to be with the IRS, and you owe tax or think you may owe tax, do not give out any information. Call the IRS directly at 1.800.829.1040 to discuss your specific situation.
• You can also contact Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) to report scam calls by calling 1.800.366.4484 or by using the "IRS Impersonation Scam Reporting" form on their website. You may also want to report the scam to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by using the "FTC Complaint Assistant" to report persons pretending to be from the government: Be sure to add "IRS Telephone Scam" in the notes.

Don’t fall for the tricks. Keep your personal information safe by remaining alert. When in doubt, assume it's a scam. For tips on protecting yourself from identity-theft-related tax fraud, click here.

No, you are not about to be arrested because of a phone call saying you owe the IRS, Social Security or local law enforcement office money.

Green Bay Police say they received a number of calls Thursday from people who were targeted by a phone scam. The caller claims to be a "Deputy Adams" from the Brown County Sheriff's Department, who says they need to withdraw money or face a warrant for their arrest.

Action 2 News has also received reports from viewers Thursday of scams from callers claiming to be with the IRS or Social Security.

Target 2 Consumer Alert reported on one of these scam calls on Sunday. Ironically, the scam is using a phone number that used to belong to an attorney in New York state.

Police remind people to never provide money or personal information to someone over the phone if you didn't solicit the call.

Remember that no government or law enforcement agency, utility or credit card company is going to require a specific form of payment such as a prepaid debit card, wire transfer or iTunes gift card.

If you get a call like this, hang up -- or don't even pick up the phone if Caller ID shows a number you don't recognize.

If they leave a voicemail, don't call the phone number they provide. Instead, look up the actual phone number of the organization they claim to be with -- the local sheriff's office, IRS, Social Security, the utility, the credit card company, etc. Find out if they are looking for you or if an account is overdue.

WICHITA FALLS (KFDX/KJTL) - The Better Business Bureau advises North Texans to ignore calls from someone claiming to be a government agency and immediately hang up because a new version of an old scam has resurfaced.

The scam is someone calling saying they are from a government agency and there is an issue with Social Security Number. But the BBB said there is an easy way of knowing if you received a scam or not.

The BBB of North Central Texas sent out a press release warning the public of phone scams. The BBB received the first Social Security phone scam on Sept. 19 Kris Altringer said she did not answer the call initially but when she called back. The scammer told her if she didn't give them her Social Security Number they would take legal Acton.

"I told them that they could go ahead with the legal proceedings and they said that law enforcement would be out to arrest me and I said that's fine I'll be waiting for them when should I expect them? And they told me a half hour," Altringer said.

President of the Wichita Falls BBB Monica Horton said unfortunately, they receive scam calls throughout the year.

"These days we are hearing from consumers that are constantly receiving calls from you know people that are trying to scam them. And these calls can become harassing. There's really nothing you can do to prevent you from receiving these calls. They cast a wide net," Horton said.

Horton says there is an easy way to know if it is a scam or not.

"The government organizations aren't going to call you unsolicited. They may return a phone call that you placed but usually their first form of contact is contacting you through the mail," Horton said.

If you do see a number you do not recognize, Horton says it is best to not answer it and if they leave you a suspicious message you can call the BBB to report it.

Most people think the age targeted the most is seniors but actually, it is 18- to 25-year-olds and according to Consumers Union, just last year phone scams cost people $350 million.

You can also report it online, for the information on how to do that, click here.

Some say there's a fix available to help stop them that's rarely used.

Turns out phone companies can use stir/shaken to authenticate the number for every call with a digital fingerprint.

Calls without that special ID may be flagged or even blocked. Problem is Stir/shaken appears to be on hold.

The FCC hopes some companies will implement it within the year.

The Blount County Sheriff's Office is warning residents about a new phone scam.

The scammers are impersonating law enforcement by pretending to be from the sheriff's communications office, then demanding people pay money for fake charges. They are spoofing the non-emergency number for the communications office.

The scammers usually tell people that there is a warrant out for their arrest due to the individual missing jury duty, and that the person must pay a fine. The scammers claim the fine must be paid through a money order, and the victim must pay it or will be arrested.

The Sheriff's Office is reminding people that they will never call to notify them of any outstanding fines or of any owed money. They also will not take gift cards, prepaid cards or money orders to pay outstanding fines.

The office is urging people to immediately hang up if they receive a call like this.

This scam is similar to one the sheriff's office has dealt with in the past. Other versions of the scam demanded people pay for traffic violations and have included a person identifying himself as Lt. James Perry.

Irish public warned of new phone scam claiming that their internet needs to be fixed

Be on your guard.

Members of the public are advised to be on alert following a series of scam phone calls over the past few days.

The scam in question concerns an automated recording that falsely claims to be an Eir technician looking to repair customer's internet connections.

The recording says that the person's connection is compromised, and prompts them to transfer to an operator in order to fix it.

From there, it appears that people are asked to present personal details or part with a sum of money in order to solve a non-existent issue.

Labour Party member Peter Horgan used social media to flag suspicious calls in County Cork, following numerous reports coming his way from concerned local citizens.

Communications regulator ComReg notes that there is no method to identity a scam call number, and they can resemble a normal, familiar, geographical or international number that people would come across on a daily basis.

They offer the following advice for the general public:
• Be wary of multiple calls/missed calls being received from the same number that you are unfamiliar with
• Do not call back any number that you don’t recognise where there is a blank or no voicemail message left
• If you dial back an unknown number by mistake, hang up immediately on calls where there appears to be no recipient on the other end or where you are left on hold
• If you have friends or relatives abroad that may be calling you, store their number (including the country prefix) in your phone and be aware of the prefix for the country where they might be calling from
• If you are getting persistent missed calls from an unknown number, or if you return a call to an unknown number, contact your service provider in the first instance and follow their code of practice, details of which are available on their website
• Do not provide any personal information, for example, banking details/PPS number/credit card details/name and address/passport numbers etc.
